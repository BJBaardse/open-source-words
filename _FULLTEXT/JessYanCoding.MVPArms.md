中文说明 A common Architecture for Android Applications developing based on MVP, integrates many Open Source Projects (like Dagger2、RxJava、Retrofit ...), to make your developing quicker and easier. Architectural Usage New Project (The following steps are too cumbersome? Now you can use the new feature (generate an app Module with one click) in new projects, to avoid the cumbersome configuration of the project, to quickly open the world of MVPArms) If you are building a new project, directly to the entire project clone (or download), as app as the main Module (It is recommended to remove the arms Module and use Gradle to depend on this framework remotely for easy updates), then the package name into their own package name , app Module contains the package structure can be used directly, a mainstream MVP +Dagger2 + Retrofit +RxJava framework so easy to build successful, and now you refer Mvp Package under the UserActivity format,Use Template to automatically generate MVP, Dagger2 related classes,With access to Wiki documents slowly grasp the framework to see more articles as soon as possible in the project to use it, in practice, learning is the fastest Old Project Old projects would like to introduce this framework, you can refer to the Wiki documentation, written in great detail Wiki Detailed usage reference Wiki (Must see!!!) Notice MVPArms Learning Project Collection Box Update Log Common Issues The use of these technologies for the latter part of the project maintenance and iterative, especially large projects is very helpful, but is to develop a pre-write a page to write a lot of MVP,Dagger2 class and interface, which is indeed a headache for the development of pre- Now the framework has been able to Template automatically generate some MVP,Dagger2 template code, and now we can very easily use the framework. Use this frame comes with automatic adaptation function, please refer to AndroidAutoLayout. This framework does not provide any third-party libraries associated with the UI(except for the AndroidAutoLayout screen adaptation scheme). Functionality & Libraries Mvp Googles officialMvp architecture project, which contains several different schema branches (this is the Dagger branch).
