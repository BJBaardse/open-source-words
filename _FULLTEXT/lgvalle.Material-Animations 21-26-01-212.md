unmaintained no maintainance is intended the content is still valid as a reference but it wont contain the latest new stuff android transition framework can be used for three main things animate activity layout content when transitioning from one activity to another animate shared elements hero views in transitions between activities animate view changes within same activity 1 transitions between activities animate existing activity layout content when transitioning from activity a to activity b content layout is animated according to defined transition there are three predefined transitions available on android transition transition you can use explode slide and fade all these transitions track changes to the visibility of target views in activity layout and animate those views to follow transition rules explode slide fade transition explode transition slide transition fade you can define these transitions declarative using xml or programmatically for the fade transition sample it would look like this declarative transitions are defined on xml files in res transition res transition activity fade xml xml xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 res transition activity slide xml xml xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 to use these transitions you need to inflate them using transitioninflater mainactivity java java override protected void oncreate bundle

exit transition slide and apply it to all visible views transition framework finds b enter transition fade and apply it to all visible views on back pressed transition framework executes enter and exit reverse animations respectively if we had defined output returntransition and reentertransition these have been executed instead returntransition reentertransition return and reenter transitions are the reverse animations for enter and exit respectively entertransition returntransition exittransition reentertransition if return or reenter are not defined android will execute a reversed version of enter and exit transitions but if you do define them you can have different transitions for entering and exiting an activity we can modify previous fade sample and define a returntransition for transitionactivity in this case a slide transition this way when returning from b to a instead of seeing a fade out reversed enter transition we will see a slide out transition transitionactivity

return transition is defined then a reversed enter transition is executed if a return transition is defined that one is executed instead without return transition with return transition enter fade in enter fade in exit fade out exit slide out transition fade transition fade2 2 shared elements between activities the idea behind this is having two different views in two different layouts and link them somehow with an animation transition framework will then do whatever animations it consider necessary to show the user a transition from one view to another keep this always in mind the view is not really moving from one layout to another they are two independent views a enable window content transition this is something you need to set up once on your app styles xml values styles xml xml style name materialanimations parent style theme appcompat light noactionbar item name android windowcontenttransitions true item style here you can also specify default enter exit and shared element transitions for the whole app if you want xml specify enter and exit transitions item name android windowentertransition transition explode item item name android windowexittransition transition explode item p pre code lt specify shared element transitions gt lt item name android windowsharedelemententertransition gt transition changebounds lt item gt lt item name android windowsharedelementexittransition gt transition changebounds lt item gt code pre p b define a common transition name to make the trick you need to give both origin and target views the same android transitionname they may have different ids or properties but android transitionname must be the same layout activity a xml xml imageview android id id small blue icon style style materialanimations icon small android src drawable circle android transitionname string blue name layout activity b xml xml imageview android id id big blue icon style style materialanimations icon big android src drawable circle android transitionname string blue name c start an activity with a shared element use the activityoptions makescenetransitionanimation method to define shared element origin view and

class view sharedview blueiconimageview string transitionname getstring r string blue name activityoptions transitionactivityoptions activityoptions makescenetransitionanimation mainactivity this sharedview transitionname startactivity i transitionactivityoptions tobundle just that code will produce this beautiful transition animation as you can see transition framework is creating and executing an animation to create the illusion that views are moving and changing shape from one activity to the other shared elements between fragments shared element transition works with fragments in a very similar way as it does with activities steps a and b are exactly the same only c changes a enable window content transition values styles xml xml style name materialanimations parent style

android documentation when true the enter transition will start as soon as possible when false the enter transition will wait until the exit transition completes before starting this works for both fragments and activities shared element transitions java fragmentb fragmentb fragmentb newinstance sample defines enter transition for all fragment views slide slidetransition new slide gravity right

animate view layout elements scenes transition framework can also be used to animate element changes within current activity layout transitions happen between scenes a scene is just a regular layout which defines a static state of our ui you can transition from one scene to another and transition framework will animate views in between java scene1 scene getsceneforlayout sceneroot r layout activity animations scene1 this scene2 scene getsceneforlayout sceneroot r layout activity animations scene2 this scene3 scene getsceneforlayout sceneroot r layout activity animations scene3 this scene4 scene getsceneforlayout sceneroot r layout activity animations scene4 this override public void onclick view v switch v getid case r id button1 transitionmanager go scene1 new changebounds break case r id button2 transitionmanager go scene2 transitioninflater from this inflatetransition r transition slide and changebounds break case r id button3 transitionmanager go scene3 transitioninflater from this inflatetransition r transition slide and changebounds sequential break case r id button4 transitionmanager go scene4 transitioninflater from this inflatetransition r transition slide and changebounds sequential with interpolators break that code would produce transition between four scenes in the same activity each transition has a different animation defined transition framework will take all visible views in current scene and calculate whatever necessary animations are needed to arrange those views according to next scene scenes anim layout changes transition framework can also be used to animate layout property changes in a view you just need to make whatever changes you want and it will perform necessary animations for you a begin delayed transition with just this line of code we are telling the framework we are going to perform some ui changes that it will need to animate java transitionmanager begindelayedtransition sceneroot b change view layout properties java viewgroup layoutparams params greeniconview getlayoutparams params width 200 greeniconview setlayoutparams params changing view width attribute to make it smaller will trigger a layoutmeasure at that point the transition framework will record start and ending values and will create an animation to transition from one to another 4 bonus shared elements circular reveal circular reveal is just an animation to show or hide a group of ui elements it is available since api 21 in viewanimationutils class circular reveal animation can be used in combination of shared element transition to create meaningful animations that smoothly teach the user what is happening in the app reveal shared anim what is happening in this example step by step is orange circle is a shared element transitioning from mainactivity to revealactivity on revealactivity there is a listener to listen for shared element transition end when that happens it does two things execute a circular reveal animation for the toolbar execute a scale up animation on revealactivity views using plain old viewpropertyanimator listen to shared element enter transition end java transition
