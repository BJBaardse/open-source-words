vim multiple cursors contents about installation quick start mapping settings interactions with other plugins highlight faq contributing credit about there have been many attempts at bringing sublime texts awesome multiple selection feature into vim but none so far have been in my opinion a faithful port that is simplistic to use yet powerful and intuitive enough for an existing vim user vim multiple cursors is yet another attempt at that its great for quick refactoring vim command sequence fp c n c n c n cname add a cursor to each line of your visual selection vim command sequence vip c n i right right right esc vipgj r idays match characters from visual selection vim command sequence df r 0f v c n â€¦ c n c cr up del right right right del use the command to match regexp to see what keystrokes are used for the above examples see the wiki page installation install using pathogen vundle neobundle or your favorite vim package manager requires vim 7 4 or later for full functionality quick start normal mode visual mode start c n start multicursor and add a virtual cursor selection on the match next c n add a new virtual cursor selection on the next match skip c x skip the next match prev c p remove current virtual cursor selection and go back on previous match select all a n start muticursor and directly select all matches you can now change the virtual cursors selection with visual mode commands for instance c s i a work without any issues you could also go to normal mode by pressing v and use normal commands there at any time you can press esc to exit back to regular vim note start with g c n to match without boundaries behaves like g instead of visual mode when multiple lines are selected start c n add virtual cursors on each line you can now change the virtual cursors with normal mode commands for instance ciw command the command multiplecursorsfind accepts a range and a pattern regexp it creates a visual cursor at the end of each match if no range is passed in then it defaults to the entire buffer mapping if you dont like the plugin taking over your key bindings you can turn it off and reassign them the way you want viml let g multi cursor use default mapping 0 default mapping let g multi cursor start word key let g multi cursor select all word key let g multi cursor start key g let g multi cursor select all key g let g multi cursor next key let g multi cursor prev key let g multi cursor skip key let g multi cursor quit key note please make sure to always map something to g multi cursor quit key otherwise youll have a tough time quitting from multicursor mode settings currently there are four additional global settings one can tweak g multi cursor exit from visual mode default 1 if set to 0 then pressing g multi cursor quit key in visual mode will not quit and delete all existing cursors useful if you want to go back to normal mode and still be able to operate on all the cursors g multi cursor exit from insert mode default 1 if set to 0 then pressing g multi cursor quit key in insert mode will not quit and delete all existing cursors useful if you want to go back to normal mode and still be able to operate on all the cursors g multi cursor normal maps default see below 1 f 1 t 1 1 \ 1 1 1 1 c 1 d 1 f 1 g 1 m 1 q 1 r 1 t 1 y 1 z 1 1 1 1 any key in this map values are ignored will cause multi cursor normal mode to pause for map completion just like normal vim otherwise keys mapped in normal mode will fail to replay when multiple cursors are active for example d 1 makes normal mode command dw work in multi cursor mode the default list contents should work for anybody unless they have remapped a key from an operator pending command to a non operator pending command or vice versa these keys must be manually listed because vim doesnt provide a way to automatically see which keys start mappings and trying to run motion commands such as j as if they were operator pending commands can break things g multi cursor visual maps default see below t 1 a 1 t 1 f 1 f 1 i 1 same principle as g multi cursor normal maps interactions with other plugins multiple cursors before multiple cursors after default nothing other plugins may be incompatible in insert mode that is why we provide hooks to disable those plug ins when vim multiple cursors is active for example if you are using neocomplete add this to your vimrc to prevent conflict viml function multiple cursors before if exists neocompletelock 2 exe neocompletelock endif endfunction function multiple cursors after if exists neocompleteunlock 2 exe neocompleteunlock endif endfunction plugins themselves can register user autocommands on multiplecursorspre and multiplecursorspost for automatic integration highlight the plugin uses the highlight group multiple cursors cursor and multiple cursors visual to highlight the virtual cursors and their visual selections respectively you can customize them by putting something similar like the following in your vimrc viml default highlighting see help highlight and help highlight link highlight multiple cursors cursor term reverse cterm reverse gui reverse highlight link multiple cursors visual visual faq q alt n doesnt seem to work in vim but works in gvim why a this is a well known terminal vim issue different terminal have different ways to send alt key try adding this in your vimrc and make sure to replace the string vim if has gui running map in insert mode type ctrl v alt n here a n endif or remap the following vim g multi cursor start key g multi cursor select all key q ctrl n doesnt seem to work in gvim a try setting set selection inclusive in your gvimrc q is it also working on mac a on mac os macvim is known to work q how can i select n keywords with several keystrokes 200 c n does not work a you can use multiplecursorsfind keyword i have this binding in my vimrc viml nnoremap silent m j multiplecursorsfind c r cr vnoremap silent m j multiplecursorsfind c r cr this allows one to search for the keyword using and turn search results into cursors with alt j contributing patches and suggestions are always welcome a list of open feature requests can be found here issue creation contributors time is precious and limited please ensure it meets the requirements outlined in contributing md pull requests running the test suite requires ruby and rake as well as vim of course before submitting pr please ensure the checks are passing bash cd vim multiple cursors spec bundle exec rake contributors this is a community supported project here is the list of all the contributors credit obviously inspired by sublime texts multiple selection feature also encouraged by emacs multiple cursors implementation by magnar sveen
