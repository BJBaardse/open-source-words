node js is a javascript runtime built on chromes v8 javascript engine for more information on using node js see the node js website the node js project is supported by the node js foundation contributions policies and releases are managed under an open governance model this project is bound by a code of conduct table of contents support release types download current and lts releases nightly releases api documentation verifying binaries building node js security current project team members tsc technical steering committee collaborators release team contributing to node js support node js contributors have limited availability to address general support questions please make sure you are using a currently supported version of node js when looking for support please first search for your question in these venues node js website node js help open or closed issues in the node js github organization if you didnt find an answer in one of the official resources above you can search these unofficial resources questions tagged node js on stackoverflow node js channel on chat freenode net see http nodeirc info for more information node js discord community node js slack community visit nodeslackers com to register github issues are meant for tracking enhancements and bugs not general support remember libre gratis the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify but not commitments of other peoples time please be respectful and set your expectations accordingly release types the node js project maintains multiple types of releases current released from active development branches of this repository versioned by semver and signed by a member of the release team code for current releases is organized in this repository by major version number for example v4 x the major version number of current releases will increment every 6 months allowing for breaking changes to be introduced this happens in april and october every year current release lines beginning in october each year have a maximum support life of 8 months current release lines beginning in april each year will convert to lts see below after 6 months and receive further support for 30 months lts releases that receive long term support with a focus on stability and security every second current release line major version will become an lts line and receive 18 months of active lts support and a further 12 months of maintenance lts release lines are given alphabetically ordered codenames beginning with v4 argon lts releases are less frequent and will attempt to maintain consistent major and minor version numbers only incrementing patch version numbers there are no breaking changes or feature additions except in some special circumstances nightly versions of code in this repository on the current current branch automatically built every 24 hours where changes exist use with caution more information can be found in the lts readme download binaries installers and source tarballs are available at https nodejs org current and lts releases current and lts releases are available at https nodejs org download release listed under their version strings the latest directory is an alias for the latest current release the latest lts release from an lts line is available in the form latest codename for example https nodejs org download release latest argon nightly releases nightly builds are available at https nodejs org download nightly listed under their version string which includes their date in utc time and the commit sha at the head of the release api documentation api documentation is available in each release and nightly directory under docs https nodejs org api points to the api documentation of the latest stable version verifying binaries current lts and nightly download directories all contain a shasums256 txt file that lists the sha checksums for each file available for download the shasums256 txt can be downloaded using curl console curl o https nodejs org dist vx y z shasums256 txt to check that a downloaded file matches the checksum run it through sha256sum with a command such as console grep node vx y z tar gz shasums256 txt sha256sum c current and lts releases but not nightlies also have the gpg detached signature of shasums256 txt available as shasums256 txt sig you can use gpg to verify that shasums256 txt has not been tampered with to verify shasums256 txt has not been altered you will first need to import all of the gpg keys of individuals authorized to create releases they are listed at the bottom of this readme under release team use a command such as this to import the keys console gpg keyserver pool sks keyservers net recv keys dd8f2338bae7501e3dd5ac78c273792f7d83545d see the bottom of this readme for a full script to import active release keys next download the shasums256 txt sig for the release console curl o https nodejs org dist vx y z shasums256 txt sig after downloading the appropriate shasums256 txt and shasums256 txt sig files you can then use gpg verify shasums256 txt sig shasums256 txt to verify that the file has been signed by an authorized member of the node js team once verified use the shasums256 txt file to get the checksum for the binary verification command above building node js see building md for instructions on how to build node js from source the document also contains a list of officially supported platforms security security flaws in node js should be reported by emailing security nodejs org please do not disclose security bugs publicly until they have been handled by the security team your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours and you will receive a more detailed response to your email within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report there are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a security issue the general rule is an issue worth reporting should allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of the node js application or its system for which the attacker does not already have the capability to illustrate the point here are some examples of past issues and what the security response team thinks of them when in doubt however please do send us a report nonetheless public disclosure preferred 14519 internal domain function can be used to cause segfaults causing program termination using either the public javascript apis or the private bindings layer apis requires the ability to execute arbitrary javascript code which is already the highest level of privilege possible 12141 buffer zero fill buffer num by default the buffer constructor behavior was documented but found to be prone to mis use it has since been changed but despite much debate was not considered misuse prone enough to justify fixing in older release lines and breaking our api stability contract private disclosure preferred cve 2016 7099 fix invalid wildcard certificate validation check this is a high severity defect that would allow a malicious tls server to serve an invalid wildcard certificate for its hostname and be improperly validated by a node js client 5507 fix a defect that makes the cachebleed attack possible many though not all openssl vulnerabilities in the tls ssl protocols also affect node js cve 2016 2216 fix defects in http header parsing for requests and responses that can allow response splitting while the impact of this vulnerability is application and network dependent it is remotely exploitable in the http protocol when in doubt please do send us a report current project team members the node js project team comprises a group of core collaborators and a sub group that forms the technical steering committee tsc which
