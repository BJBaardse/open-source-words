react toolbox is a set of react components that implement googles material design specification its powered by css modules and harmoniously integrates with your webpack workflow although you can use any other module bundler you can take a tour through our documentation website and try the components live installation react toolbox can be installed as an npm package bash npm install save react toolbox prerequisites react toolbox uses css modules by default to import stylesheets written in sass in case you want to import the components already bundled with css your module bundler should be able to require these sass modules although we recommend webpack you are free to use whatever module bundler you want as long as it can compile and require sass files located in your node modules if you are experiencing require errors make sure your configuration satisfies this requirement of course this is a set of react components so you should be familiar with react if want to customize your components via themes you may want to take a look to react css themr which is used by react toolbox to make component easily themeable basic usage in this minimal example we import a button with styles already bundled js import react from react import reactdom from react dom import button from react toolbox lib button reactdom render document getelementbyid app take into account that any required style will be included in the final css so your final would include button styles in this case its more convenient to import components this way or with raw imports because if you require from the project root every stylesheet of react toolbox will be included even if you dont use it importing components first lets take a look on how the components are structured in the project the components folder contains a folder for each component or set of related components for example the app bar app bar appbar js config scss index js readme md theme scss as you can see in the previous block each folder includes a javascript file for each component subcomponent a readme with documentation an index javascript file that imports and injects styles and dependencies for you a default theme sass stylesheet and a configuration partial with configuration variables depending on whether you want the styles to be directly bundled or not you can import components in two different ways bundled component you import from the index file so the imported component comes with all dependencies and themes already required and injected for you this means that the css for each dependency will be bundled in your final css automatically and the component markup includes the classnames to be styled for example js import appbar from react toolbox lib app bar raw component you import from the component definition so the imported component is bundled with its dependencies but it does not require any style for you this means that no css will be bundled and the component markup will not include any classname its your responsibility to provide a theme to the component to be properly style and you can do it via properties or context for example js import appbar from react toolbox lib app bar appbar js customizing components every component accepts a theme property intended to provide a css module import object that will be used by the component to assign local classnames to its dom nodes therefore each one implements a documented classname api so if you want to customize a component you just need to provide a theme object with the appropriated classname mapping if the component has already a theme injected the properties you pass will be merged with the injected in this way you can add classnames to the nodes of a specific component and use them to add or to override styles for example if you want to customize the appbar to be purple js import react from react import appbar from react toolbox lib app bar import theme from purpleappbar scss const purpleappbar props export default purpleappbar scss appbar background color 800080 in this case we are adding styles to an appbar component that already has some styles injected it works because the component background by default has the same priority as the one we added there will be cases where the original rule is more restrictive for those cases you would need to boost priority using the same restrictions as in the original stylesheet feel free to take a look into the original themes or just check the selectors you want to override in devtools if the component has no styles injected you should provide a theme object implementing the full api you are free to require the css module you want but take into account that every classname is there for a reason you can either provide a theme via prop or via context as we will see later theming you can afford theming in multiple ways first of all you have to understand that react toolbox stylesheets are written in sass and configured using the config files we saw earlier also you may want to check colors and globals files to get an overview on the variables you have to override to get the results you want in most scenarios you can get more customized themes by overriding those variables and compiling stylesheets with them for example you can create a theme scss sass file scss import react toolbox lib colors color primary palette blue 500 color primary dark palette blue 700 this file should be prepended to each stylesheet compilation which can be achieved in multiple ways using sass loader if you are using webpack as module bundler you are probably using sass loader as well what we want to do is to prepend to each sass file compilation a bunch of variables to override and this can be done with the data option for example js sassloader data import path resolve dirname theme theme scss in this case we are prepending the theme import to each sass compilation so the primary color will be changed in every single stylesheet if you are not using webpack maybe your loader still has a similar option otherwise dont worry there are solutions using sass imports and props remember that you can import components without styles and provide those styles using the theme property for example a theme for a button customized with the previous theme file would be like scss import theme scss import react toolbox lib button theme then when you use a button you can inject the appropriated theme js import button from react toolbox lib button button import buttontheme from theme button scss const themedbutton props export default themedbutton with this technique you have to create wrappers for every component and this is not cool at all but dont worry we can provide the theme via context to avoid this using sass imports and context this is a good moment to check out react css themr if you still didnt every component in react toolbox has a key assigned that can be used to provide a default css module you can create a theme like js export default rtripple require ripple scss rtbutton require button scss check for each component what key uses then when you have a theme object fully imported and customized for each component your application uses you can use it like we list here js import react from react import render from react dom import themeprovider from react css themr import theme from theme theme js import app from app js render document getelementbyid app a couple of things here first you need to use raw components to get this styles properly applied second you have to add dependency themes by yourself for example the button requires ripple so you have to provide styles for both of them also recall that all components accepts a theme verifying required classnames but there may be some missing if any property is missing you can check the selectors you want to override straight in the devtools roboto font and material design icons react toolbox assumes that you are importing roboto font and material design icons in order to import the fonts for you wed need to include them in the css which is considered a bad practice if you are not including them in your app go to the linked sites and follow the instructions server side rendering the only requirement for ssr is to be able to require es6 and css modules in the backend to make it possible you can check projects like css modules register hook or webpack isomorphic tools also make sure you can import from node modules examples for now we have a repository example demonstrating configuration and some basic customization for now its not using ssr rendering but it shouldnt be difficult to implement an example so it will come soon feel free to pr your example project or to add some use cases to the repository typescript typescript external module definition files are included and should not require any manual steps to utilize they will be picked up by the typescript compiler when importing from the npm package note that to comply with the official recommendation for npm typings a triple slash reference to react d ts is not included you will need to reference react d ts somewhere in your project authors and contributors the project is being initially developed and maintained by javier velasco and javier jim√©nez and the contribution scene is just getting warm we want to create reference components so any contribution is very welcome to work in the project youd need a node version supporting es6 syntax although the project is built using babel we use some es6 features in the development server also the package has been tested with node 4 2 1 consider using nvm or n to handle different node versions to start the documentation site locally youll need to install the dependencies from both the main package and the docs subproject git clone https github com react toolbox react toolbox git cd react toolbox npm install cd docs npm install npm start local documentation will then be available at http localhost 8081 extensions we dont officially support components that are not covered by google material design if you want to implement some complementary component feel free to open a pr adding your a link in this section for now you can check on github react toolbox additions and on npm react toolbox additions license this project is licensed under
