mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications it is an open source implementation of microsofts net framework based on the ecma standards for c and the common language runtime the mono project is part of the net foundation compilation and installation using mono directory roadmap contributing to mono reporting bugs configuration options

building from git assumes that you already have mono installed so please download and install the latest mono release before trying to build from git this is required because the mono build relies on a working mono c compiler to compile itself also known as bootstrapping if you dont have a working mono installation if you dont have a working mono installation you can try a slightly more risky approach getting the latest version of the monolite distribution which contains just enough to run the mcs compiler you do this with run the following line after autogen sh make get monolite latest this will download and place the files appropriately so that you can then just run make the build will then use the files downloaded by make get monolite latest testing and installation you can run the mono and mcs test suites with the command make check expect to find a few test suite failures as a sanity check you can compare the failures you got with https jenkins mono project com you can now install mono with make install you can verify your installation by using the mono test install script it can diagnose some common problems with monos install failure to follow these steps may result in a broken installation using mono once you have installed the software you can run a few programs mono program exe runtime engine mcs program cs c compiler monodis program exe cil disassembler see

collection of tools mostly used during mono development contributing to mono before submitting changes to mono please review the contribution guidelines please pay particular attention to the important rules section reporting bugs to submit bug reports please open an issue on the mono github repo please use the search facility to ensure the same bug hasnt already been submitted and follow our guidelines on how to make a good bug report configuration options the following are the configuration options that someone building mono might want to use with sgen yes no generational gc support used to enable or disable the compilation of a mono runtime with the sgen garbage collector on platforms that support it after building mono you will have both a mono boehm binary and a mono sgen binary mono boehm uses boehm while mono sgen uses the simple generational gc with libgc included none selects the default boehm garbage collector engine to use included slightly modified boehm gc this is the default value for the boehm gc and its the most feature complete it will allow mono to use typed allocations and support the debugger none disables the inclusion of a boehm garbage collector this defaults to included enable cooperative suspend if you pass this flag the mono runtime is configured to only use the cooperative mode of the garbage collector if you do not pass this flag then you can control at runtime the use of the cooperative gc mode by setting the mono enable coop suspend flag with tls thread pthread controls how mono should access thread local storage pthread forces mono to use the pthread apis while thread uses compiler optimized access to it although thread is faster it requires support from the compiler kernel and libc old linux systems do not support with thread this value is typically pre configured and there is no need to set it unless you are trying to debug a problem with sigaltstack yes no experimental use at your own risk it is known to cause problems with garbage collection and is hard to reproduce those bugs this controls whether mono will install a special signal handler to handle stack overflows if set to yes it will turn stack overflows into the stackoverflowexception otherwise when a stack overflow happens your program will receive a segmentation fault the configure script will try to detect if your operating system supports this some older linux systems do not support this feature or you might want to override the auto detection with static mono yes no this controls whether mono should link against a static library libmono a or a shared library libmono so this defaults to yes and will improve the performance of the mono program this only affects the mono binary the shared library libmono so will always be produced for developers that want to embed the runtime in their application with xen opt yes no optimize code for xen virtualization it makes mono generate code which might be slightly slower on average systems but the resulting executable will run faster under the xen virtualization system this defaults to yes with large heap yes no enable support for gc heaps larger than 3gb this defaults to no enable small config yes no enable some tweaks to reduce memory usage and disk footprint at the expense of some capabilities typically this means that the number of threads that can be created is limited 256 that the maximum heap size is also reduced 256 mb and other such limitations that still make mono useful but more suitable to embedded devices like mobile phones this defaults to no with ikvm native yes no controls whether the ikvm jni interface library is built or not this is used if you are planning on using the ikvm java virtual machine with mono this defaults to yes with profile4 yes no whether you want to build the 4 x profile libraries and runtime this defaults to yes with libgdiplus installed sibling path configure where mono searches for libgdiplus when running system drawing tests it defaults to installed which means that the library is available to mono through the regular system setup sibling can be used to specify that a libgdiplus that resides as a sibling of this directory mono should be used or you can specify a path to a libgdiplus enable minimal list use this feature to specify optional runtime components that you might not want to include this is only useful for developers embedding mono that require a subset of mono functionality the list is a comma separated list of components that should be removed these are aot disables support for the ahead of time compilation attach support for the mono management assembly and the vmattach api allowing code to be injected into a target vm com disables com support debug drop debugging support decimal disables support for system decimal full messages by default mono comes with a full table of messages for error codes this feature turns off uncommon error messages and reduces the runtime size generics generics support disabling this will not allow mono to run any 2 0 libraries or code that contains generics jit removes the jit engine from the build this reduces the executable size and requires that all code executed by the virtual machine be compiled with full aot before execution large code disables support for large assemblies logging disables support for debug logging pinvoke support for platform invocation services disabling this will drop support for any libraries using dllimport portability removes support for mono iomap the environment variables for simplifying porting applications that are case insensitive and that mix the unix and windows path separators profiler disables support for the default profiler reflection emit drop system reflection emit support reflection emit save drop support for saving dynamically created assemblies assemblybuilderaccess save in system reflection emit shadow copy disables support for appdomains shadow copies you can disable this if you do not plan on using appdomains simd disables support for the mono simd intrinsics library ssa disables compilation for the ssa optimization framework and the various ssa based optimizations enable llvm enable loadedllvm this enables the use of llvm as a code generation engine for mono the llvm code generator and optimizer will be used instead of monos built in code generator for both just in time and ahead of time compilations see http www mono project com docs advanced mono llvm for the full details and up to date information on this feature you will need to have an llvm built that mono can link against the enable loadedllvm variant will make the llvm backend into a runtime loadable module instead of linking it directly into the main mono binary enable big arrays enable use of arrays with indexes larger than int32 maxvalue by default mono has the same limitation as net on win32 and win64 and limits array indexes to 32 bit values even on 64 bit systems in certain scenarios where large arrays are required you can pass this flag and mono will be built to support 64 bit arrays this is not the default as it breaks the c embedding abi that we have exposed through the mono development cycle enable parallel mark use this option to enable the garbage collector to use multiple cpus to do its work this helps performance on multi cpu machines as the work is divided across cpus this option is not currently the default on osx as it runs into issues there this option only applies to the boehm gc enable dtrace on solaris and macos x builds a version of the mono runtime that contains dtrace probes and can participate in the system profiling using dtrace disable dev random mono uses dev random to obtain good random data for any source that requires random numbers if your system does not support this you might want to disable it there are a number of runtime options to control this also see the man page with csc roslyn mcs default use this option to configure which c compiler to use by default the configure script will pick roslyn except on platforms where roslyn does not work big endian systems where it will pick mcs if you specify mcs then monos c compiler will be used this also allows for a complete bootstrap of monos core compiler and core libraries from source if you specify roslyn then roslyns c compiler will be used this currently uses roslyn binaries enable nacl this configures the mono compiler to generate code suitable to be used by googles native client http code google com p nativeclient currently this is used with monos aot engine as native client does not support jit engines yet enable wasm use this option to configure mono to run on webassembly it will set both host and target to the webassembly triplet this overrides the values passed to host or target and ignored what config sub guesses this is a workaround to enable usage of old automake versions that dont recognize the wasm triplet working with submodules mono references several external git submodules for example a fork of microsofts reference source code that has been altered to be suitable for use with the mono runtime this section describes how to use it an initial clone should be done recursively so all submodules will also be cloned in a single pass git clone recursive git github com mono mono once cloned submodules can be updated to pull down the latest changes this can also be done after an initial non recursive clone git submodule update init recursive to pull external changes into a submodule cd submodule git pull origin branch cd top level git add submodule git commit by default submodules are detached because they point to a specific commit use git checkout to move back to a branch before making changes cd submodule git checkout branch work as normal the submodule is a normal repo git commit push new changes to the repo submodule cd top level git add submodule this will record the new commits to the submodule git commit to switch the repo of a submodule this should not be a common or normal thing to do at all first edit gitmodules to point to the new location then git submodule sync path of the submodule git submodule update recursive git checkout desired new hash or branch the desired output diff is a change in gitmodules to reflect the change in the remote url and a change in where you see the desired change in the commit hash license see the license file for licensing information and the patents txt file for information about microsofts patent grant mono trademark use policy the use of

the topmost net 4 x sln file or to by loading one of the individual csproj files located in each directory these are maintained by extracting the configuration information from our makefiles which as of may 2016 remain the canonical location for configuration information when changes are made to the makefiles a user would need to run the following command to re generate the solution files at the top level make update solution files
