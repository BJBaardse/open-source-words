CasperJS Important note: the master branch hosts the development version of CasperJS, which is now pretty stable and should be the right version to use if you ask me. Users interested in a pretty stable, recent version working with PhantomJS 2.0 and newer should choose the packaged 1.1.0 and following releases. The 1.0 branch is now obsolete. Please note that - it is only recommended if you need to keep old production tests running that could do with the now unmaintained PhantomJS 1.9 - 1.0 tests unfortunately have to be run manually using the casperjs selftest command Note that all versions up to and including 1.1-beta3 do not support PhantomJS 2.0 and newer. The complete documentation for the current releases is hosted on docs.casperjs.org. CasperJS is a navigation scripting & testing utility for PhantomJS and SlimerJS (still experimental). It eases the process of defining a full navigation scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods & syntactic sugar for doing common tasks such as: defining & ordering navigation steps filling forms clicking links capturing screenshots of a page (or an area) making assertions on remote DOM logging & events downloading resources, even binary ones catching errors and react accordingly writing functional test suites, exporting results as JUnit XML (xUnit) Browse the sample examples repository.
