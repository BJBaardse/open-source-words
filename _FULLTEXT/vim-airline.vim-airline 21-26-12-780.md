from i wrote the initial version on an airplane and since its light as air it turned out to be a good name thanks for flying vim installation this plugin follows the standard runtime path structure

you will need to install a patched font instructions can be found in the official powerline documentation prepatched fonts can be found in the powerline fonts repository finally you can add the convenience variable let g airline powerline fonts 1 to your vimrc which will automatically populate the g airline symbols dictionary with the powerline symbols faq solutions to common problems can be found in the wiki performance whoa everything got slow all of a sudden vim airline strives to make it easy to use out of the box which means that by default it will look for all compatible plugins that you have installed and enable the relevant extension many optimizations have been made such that the majority of users will not see any performance degradation but it can still happen for example users who routinely open very large files may want to disable the tagbar extension as it can be very expensive to scan for the name of the current function the minivimrc project has some helper mappings to troubleshoot performance related issues if you dont want all the bells and whistles enabled by default you can define a value for g airline extensions when this variable is defined only the extensions listed will be loaded an empty array would effectively disable all extensions e g let g airline extensions also you can enable caching of the various syntax highlighting groups this will try to prevent some of the more expensive hi calls in vim which seem to be expensive in the vim core at the expense of possibly not being one hundred percent correct all the time especially if you often change highlighting groups yourself using hi commands to set this up do let g airline highlighting cache 1 a airlinerefresh will however clear the cache in addition you might want to check out the dark minimal theme which does not change highlighting groups once they are defined also please check the faq for more information on how to diagnose and fix the problem screenshots a full list
