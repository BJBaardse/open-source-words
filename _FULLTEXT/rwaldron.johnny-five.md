Johnny-Five The JavaScript Robotics Programming Framework Hello! Please dont edit this file! If youd like to make changes to the readme contents, please make them in the tpl/.readme.md file. If youd like to add an example: 1. Add the file in `eg/` 2. Add a breadboard image in `docs/breadboards` 3. Add an entry to `tpl/programs.json`. 4. Generated the markdown with: `grunt examples` Artwork by Mike Sgier Johnny-Five is an Open Source, Firmata Protocol based, IoT and Robotics programming framework, developed at Bocoup. Johnny-Five programs can be written for Arduino (all models), Electric Imp, Beagle Bone, Intel Galileo & Edison, Linino One, Pinoccio, pcDuino3, Raspberry Pi, Particle/Spark Core & Photon, Tessel 2, TI Launchpad and more! Johnny-Five has grown from a passion project into a tool for inspiring learning and creativity for people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all across the world. Just interested in learning and building awesome things? You might want to start with the official Johnny-Five website. The website combines content from this repo, the wiki, tutorials from the Bocoup blog and several third-party websites into a single, easily-discoverable source: If you want to find the API documentation, thats right here. Need to figure out what platform to use for a project? We put that stuff here. Need inspiration for your next NodeBot? Check out the examples. Want to stay up-to-date with projects in the community? Check this out. Need NodeBots community or Johnny-Five project updates and announcements? This is what youre looking for. Johnny-Five does not attempt to provide "all the things", but instead focuses on delivering robust, reality tested, highly composable APIs that behave consistently across all supported hardware platforms. Johnny-Five wants to be a baseline control kit for hardware projects, allowing you the freedom to build, grow and experiment with diverse JavaScript libraries of your own choice. Johnny-Five couples comfortably with: Popular application libraries such as Express.js and Socket.io. Fellow hardware projects like ar-drone, Aerogel and Spheron Bluetooth game controllers like XBox Controller and DualShock IoT frameworks, such as Octoblu ...And thats only a few of the many explorable possibilities. Check out these exciting projects: node-pulsesensor, footballbot-workshop-ui, nodebotui, dublin-disco, node-slot-car-bot, servo-calibrator, node-ardx, nodebot-workshop, phone-home, purple-unicorn, webduino, leapduino, lasercat-workshop, simplesense, five-redbot, robotnik, the-blender Why JavaScript? NodeBots: The Rise of JavaScript Robotics Hello Johnny The ubiquitous "Hello World" program of the microcontroller and SoC world is "blink an LED". The following code demonstrates how this is done using the Johnny-Five framework. ```javascript var five = require("johnny-five"); var board = new five.Board(); board.on("ready", function() { // Create an Led on pin 13 var led = new five.Led(13); // Blink every half second led.blink(500); }); ``` Note: Node will crash if you try to run johnny-five in the node REPL, but board instances will create their own contextual REPL. Put your script in a file. Supported Hardware Johnny-Five has been tested on a variety of Arduino-compatible Boards. For non-Arduino based projects, a number of platform-specific IO Plugins are available. IO Plugins allow Johnny-Five code to communicate with any non-Arduino based hardware in whatever language that platforms speaks! Documentation Documentation for the Johnny-Five API can be found here and example programs here. Guidance Need help? Ask a question on the NodeBots Community Forum. If you just have a quick question or are interested in ongoing design discussions, join us in the Johnny-Five Gitter Chat. For step-by-step examples, including an electronics primer, check out Arduino Experimenters Guide for NodeJS by @AnnaGerber Here is a list of prerequisites for Linux, OSX or Windows. Check out the bluetooth guide if you want to remotely control your robot. Setup and Assemble Arduino Recommended Starting Kit: Sparkfun Inventors Kit Download Arduino IDE Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmataPlus StandardFirmataPlus is available in Firmata v2.5.0 or greater Click the "Upload" button. If the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE. For non-Arduino projects, each IO Plugins repo will provide its own platform specific setup instructions. Hey you, heres Johnny! Source Code: ``` bash git clone git://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five.git && cd johnny-five npm install ``` npm package: Install the module with: bash npm install johnny-five Example Programs To get you up and running quickly, we provide a variety of examples for using each Johnny-Five component. One thing were especially excited about is the extensive collection of Fritzing diagrams youll find throughout the site. A huge part of doing any Johnny-Five project is handling the actual hardware, and weve included these as part of the documentation because we realised that instructions on how to write code to control a servo are insufficient without instructions on how to connect a servo! To interactively navigate the examples, visit the Johnny-Five examples page on the official website. If you want to link directly to the examples in this repo, you can use one of the following links. There are presently 363 example programs with code and diagrams! extract-start:examples Board Board - Basic Initialization Board - Cleanup in exit event Board - Multiple in one program Board - Specify Sampling Interval Board -
