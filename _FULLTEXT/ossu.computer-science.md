Open Source Society University Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science! Contents Summary Curriculum Prerequisites Introduction to Computer Science Core CS Advanced CS Final project Pro CS Code of conduct Community How to show your progress Team References Summary The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. Its not merely for career training or professional development. Its for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria. Courses must: - Be open for enrollment - Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running at least once a month or so) - Fulfill the academic requirements of OSSU - Fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to topics and difficulty level - Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book. When there are courses or books that dont fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in extras/courses or extras/readings. Organization. The curriculum is designed as follows: - Intro CS: for students to try out CS and see if its right for them - Core CS: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take - Advanced CS: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the students interests - Final Project: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide - Pro CS: graduate-level specializations students can elect to take after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize their chances of getting a good job Duration. It is possible to finish Core CS within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies. Courses in Core CS should be taken linearly if possible, but since a perfectly linear progression is rarely possible, each classs prerequisites is specified so that you can design a logical but non-linear progression based on the class schedules and your own life plans. Cost. All or nearly all course material prior to Pro CS is available for free, however some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded. Note that Coursera offers financial aid. Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget; just remember that you cant purchase success! Content policy. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of each course!

Curriculum Curriculum version: 8.0.0 (see CHANGELOG) Prerequisites Introduction to Computer Science Core CS Core programming Core math Core systems Core theory Core applications Advanced CS Advanced programming Advanced math Advanced systems Advanced theory Advanced applications Final project Pro CS Prerequisites Core CS assumes the student has already taken high school math and physics, including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus. Some high school graduates will have already taken AP Calculus, but this is usually only about 3/4 of a college calculus class, so the calculus courses in the curriculum are still recommended. Advanced CS assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take. Note that Advanced systems assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school). Introduction to Computer Science These courses will introduce you to the world of computer science. Both are required, but feel free to skip straight to the second course when CS50 (the first course) moves away from C. (Why?)

Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken. But students should take every course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into. The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under Advanced applications. A Specializations Capstone, if taken, may act as the Final project, if permitted by the Honor Code of the course. If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum. Note that doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money. So if you dont wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final, it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.

You are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you can use your knowledge to solve a real world problem. After youve gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge youve acquired. Not only does real project work look great on a resume, the project will validate and consolidate your knowledge. You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like CodeTriage or First Timers Only. Another option is using the Capstone project from taking one of the Specializations in Advanced applications; whether or not this makes sense depends on the course, the project, and whether or not the courses Honor Code permits you to display your work publicly. In some cases, it may not be permitted; do not violate your courses Honor Code! Put the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository! Markdown: [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) HTML: <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Computer Science" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg"></a> Evaluation Upon completing your final project, submit your projects information to PROJECTS via a pull request and use our community channels to announce it to your fellow students. Your peers and mentors from OSSU will then informally evaluate your project. You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense â€” everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success. The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist, and to get experience listening to feedback â€” both positive and negative â€” and taking it in stride. The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether OSSU, through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class computer science education. Cooperative work You can create this project alone or with other students! We love cooperative work! Use our channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects! Which programming languages should I use? My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use any language that you want to complete the final project. The important thing is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish. Pro CS After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelors degree in Computer Science, or quite close to one. You can stop in the Advanced CS section, but the next step to completing your studies is to develop skills and knowledge in a specific domain. Many of these courses are graduate-level. Choose one or more of the following specializations: - Mastering Software Development in R Specialization by Johns Hopkins University - Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree by IBM, Amazon, and Didi - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by kaggle - Cybersecurity MicroMasters by the Rochester Institute of Technology - Android Developer Nanodegree by Google These arent the only specializations you can choose. Check the following websites for more options: - edX: xSeries - Coursera: Specializations - Udacity: Nanodegree Where to go next? Look for a job as a developer! Check out the readings for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge. Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via meetup.com). Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development: Explore the actor model through Elixir, a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine! Explore borrowing and lifetimes through Rust, a systems language which achieves memory- and thread-safety without a garbage collector! Explore dependent type systems through Idris, a new Haskell-inspired language with unprecedented support for type-driven development. Code of conduct OSSUs code of conduct.

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the Doing column or Done column as you progress in your study. We also have labels to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is: Main Curriculum: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum. Extra Resources: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student. Doing: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing. Done: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course. Section: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the Section label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the Courses cards below its respective Sections card. The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be public or private.
