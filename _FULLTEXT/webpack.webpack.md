Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Install Install with npm: bash npm install --save-dev webpack Install with yarn: bash yarn add webpack --dev Introduction This README reflects webpack v2.x and v3.x. The webpack v1.x documentation has been deprecated and deleted. webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. TL;DR Bundles ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules (even combined). Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time). Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size. Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc. Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires. Get Started Check out webpacks quick Get Started guide and the other guides. Browser Compatibility webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported). webpack also needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions. Concepts Plugins webpack has a rich plugin interface. Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very flexible. |Name|Status|Install Size|Description| |:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------| |extract-text-webpack-plugin|![extract-npm]|![extract-size]|Extracts Text (CSS) from your bundles into a separate file (app.bundle.css)| |compression-webpack-plugin|![compression-npm]|![compression-size]|Prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding| |i18n-webpack-plugin|![i18n-npm]|![i18n-size]|Adds i18n support to your bundles| |html-webpack-plugin|![html-plugin-npm]|![html-plugin-size]| Simplifies creation of HTML files (index.html) to serve your bundles| Loaders webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond JavaScript. You can easily write your own loaders using Node.js. Loaders are activated by using loadername! prefixes in require() statements, or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

This makes webpack fast and incredibly fast on incremental compilations. Module Formats webpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules out of the box. It performs clever static analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box. Code Splitting webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time. Optimizations webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your JavaScript by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting. It can also make your code chunks cache friendly by using hashes. Contributing We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone. We have a vibrant ecosystem that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in our organization or webpack-contrib organization which houses all of our loaders and plugins. Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including: Documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes Spelling or grammar fixes README.md corrections or redesigns Adding unit, or functional tests Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible. Searching #webpack on twitter and helping someone else who needs help Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpacks repos! Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about one of webpacks many features. Helping others in our webpack gitter channel. If you are worried or dont know where to start, you can always reach out to Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance! We have also started a series on our Medium Publication called The Contributors Guide to webpack. We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help. Looking to speak about webpack? Wed love to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!! Creating your own plugins and loaders If you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the x-loader, x-webpack-plugin naming convention. Support We consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isnt always the easiest entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, were always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, were all ears! If youre just getting started, take a look at our new docs and concepts page. This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!! Looking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old wiki, but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported. If you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our Gitter room where there are always individuals looking to help out! If you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post a question to StackOverflow with the webpack tag. It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, wed be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!) If you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also. If you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.

Thanks to (In chronological order) @google for Google Web Toolkit (GWT), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar Code Splitting as webpack. @medikoo for modules-webmake, which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the Code Splitting issue is still open (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion). @substack for browserify, which is a similar project and source for many ideas. @jrburke for require.js, which is a similar project and source for many ideas. @defunctzombie for the browser-field spec, which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack. Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction... @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem... Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.
