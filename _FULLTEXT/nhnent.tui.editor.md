TOAST UI Editor respects both CommonMark and GFM specifications. Write documents with ease using productive tools provided by TOAST UI Editor and you can easily open the produced document wherever the specifications are supported. Powerful Extensions CommonMark and GFM are great, but we often need more abstraction. The TOAST UI Editor comes with powerful Extensions in compliance with the Markdown syntax. You also get the flexibility to develop your own extensions using simple APIs. Here are some of the extensions you can start with: Color picker: ColorPicker provides an easy way to color text with a GUI tool box Chart code block: A Code block marked as a chart will render charts UML code block: A Code block marked as an uml will render UML diagrams Table merge: You can merge columns and rows in tables To learn more about Extensions check the Using Extension üé® Features TOAST UI Editor provides Markdown mode and WYSIWYG mode.

If you are using bower please see Getting started with bower. Editor HTML Place a <div></div> where you want TOAST UI Editor rendered. html <body> ... <div id="editSection"></div> ... </body> javascript Add dependencies & initialize Editor class with given element to make an Editor. ```javascript // deps for editor require(codemirror/lib/codemirror.css) // codemirror require(tui-editor/dist/tui-editor.css); // editor ui require(tui-editor/dist/tui-editor-contents.css); // editor content require(highlight.js/styles/github.css); // code block highlight var Editor = require(tui-editor); ... var editor = new Editor({ el: document.querySelector(#editSection), initialEditType: markdown, previewStyle: vertical, height: 300px }); ``` or you can use jquery plugin. javascript $(#editSection).tuiEditor({ initialEditType: markdown, previewStyle: vertical, height: 300px }); options height: Height in string or auto ex) 300px | auto initialValue: Initial value. Set Markdown string initialEditType: Initial type to show markdown | wysiwyg previewType: Preview style of Markdown mode tab | vertical usageStatistics: Let us know the hostname. We want to learn from you how you are using the editor. You are free to disable it. true | false Find out more options here Viewer TOAST UI Editor provides a Viewer in case you want to show Markdown content without loading the editor. The Viewer is much lighter than the editor. ```javascript // deps for viewer. require(tui-editor/dist/tui-editor-contents.css); // editor content require(highlight.js/styles/github.css); // code block highlight var Viewer = require(tui-editor/dist/tui-editor-Viewer); ... var editor = new Viewer({ el: document.querySelector(#viewerSection), height: 500px, initialValue: # content to be rendered }); ... ``` Be careful not to load both the editor and the viewer at the same time because the editor already contains the viewer function, you can initialize editor Editor.factory() and set the viewer option to value true in order to make the editor a viewer. You can also call getHTML() to render the HTML. javascript var Editor = require(tui-editor); ... var editor = Editor.factory({ el: document.querySelector(#viewerSection), viewer: true, height: 500px, initialValue: # content to be rendered }); ... TOAST UI Editor respects CommonMark and GFM. So any Markdown renderer including markdownit can handle the content made using TOAST UI Editor. You can also use any of these renderer in place of TOAST UI Editor Viewer. üìô Docs Getting started Getting started with bower Writing your own extension APIs üêæ Examples editor basic viewer basic jQuery plugin uml extension chart extension writing extension all extensions üí¨ Contributing Code of Conduct Contributing guideline Commit convention üçû TOAST UI Family TOAST UI Grid TOAST UI Chart TOAST UI Calendar TOAST UI Components üöÄ Used By TOAST Dooray! - Collaboration Service (Project, Messenger, Mail) üìú License This software is licensed under the MIT ¬© NHN Ent.
