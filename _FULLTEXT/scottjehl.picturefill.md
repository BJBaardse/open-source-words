Usage, Demos, Docs To find out how to use Picturefill, visit the project site. The gotchas Be it browser issues, the responsive images specifications, or Picturefill itself, there are a couple gotchas you should be aware of when working with Picturefill: Firefox 38 and 39 has some bugs [1] [2] [3] where images wont update on screen resize. These issues are addressed by Picturefill 3.0.0, and was fixed in Firefox 41. Per the picture spec, using % isnt allowed in the sizes attribute. Using % will fallback to 100vw. Trying to use the src attribute in a browser that doesnt support picture natively can result in a double download. To avoid this, dont use the src attribute on the img tag: html <picture> <source srcset="../img/sample.svg" media="(min-width: 768px)" /> <img srcset="default.png" alt="Sample pic" /> </picture> If you only want to have an image show up at certain sizes, and not show up at others, you will need to use a transparent placeholder gif: html <picture> <source srcset="../img/sample.svg" media="(min-width: 768px)" /> <img srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Sample pic" /> </picture> Contributing For information on how to contribute code to Picturefill, check out CONTRIBUTING.md Issues If you find a bug in Picturefill, please add it to the issue tracker Discussion Picturefill discussion takes place via Slack.
