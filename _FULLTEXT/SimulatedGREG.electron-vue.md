Check out the detailed documentation here. Things youll find in this boilerplate...

Make sure to check out A Note for Windows Users to make sure you have all the necessary build tools needed for electron and other dependencies. Wanting to use Vue 1? Just point to the 1.0 branch. Please note that electron-vue has officially deprecated the usage of vue@^1, so project structure, features, and documentation will reflect those changes (legacy documentation). bash vue init simulatedgreg/electron-vue#1.0 my-project Next Steps Make sure to take a look at the documentation.
