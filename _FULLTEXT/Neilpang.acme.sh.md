How to install 1. Install online Check this project: https://github.com/Neilpang/get.acme.sh bash curl https://get.acme.sh | sh Or: bash wget -O - https://get.acme.sh | sh 2. Or, Install from git Clone this project and launch installation: bash git clone https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh.git cd ./acme.sh ./acme.sh --install You dont have to be root then, although it is recommended. Advanced Installation: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-install The installer will perform 3 actions: Create and copy acme.sh to your home dir ($HOME): ~/.acme.sh/. All certs will be placed in this folder too. Create alias for: acme.sh=~/.acme.sh/acme.sh. Create daily cron job to check and renew the certs if needed. Cron entry example: bash 0 0 * * * "/home/user/.acme.sh"/acme.sh --cron --home "/home/user/.acme.sh" > /dev/null After the installation, you must close the current terminal and reopen it to make the alias take effect. Ok, you are ready to issue certs now. Show help message: sh root@v1:~# acme.sh -h 2. Just issue a cert Example 1: Single domain. bash acme.sh --issue -d example.com -w /home/wwwroot/example.com or: bash acme.sh --issue -d example.com -w /home/username/public_html or: bash acme.sh --issue -d example.com -w /var/www/html Example 2: Multiple domains in the same cert. bash acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com -w /home/wwwroot/example.com The parameter /home/wwwroot/example.com or /home/username/public_html or /var/www/html is the web root folder where you host your website files. You MUST have write access to this folder. Second argument "example.com" is the main domain you want to issue the cert for. You must have at least one domain there. You must point and bind all the domains to the same webroot dir: /home/wwwroot/example.com. The certs will be placed in ~/.acme.sh/example.com/ The certs will be renewed automatically every 60 days. More examples: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert 3. Install the cert to Apache/Nginx etc. After the cert is generated, you probably want to install/copy the cert to your Apache/Nginx or other servers. You MUST use this command to copy the certs to the target files, DO NOT use the certs files in ~/.acme.sh/ folder, they are for internal use only, the folder structure may change in the future. Apache example: bash acme.sh --install-cert -d example.com \ --cert-file /path/to/certfile/in/apache/cert.pem \ --key-file /path/to/keyfile/in/apache/key.pem \ --fullchain-file /path/to/fullchain/certfile/apache/fullchain.pem \ --reloadcmd "service apache2 force-reload" Nginx example: bash acme.sh --install-cert -d example.com \ --key-file /path/to/keyfile/in/nginx/key.pem \ --fullchain-file /path/to/fullchain/nginx/cert.pem \ --reloadcmd "service nginx force-reload" Only the domain is required, all the other parameters are optional. The ownership and permission info of existing files are preserved. You can pre-create the files to define the ownership and permission. Install/copy the cert/key to the production Apache or Nginx path. The cert will be renewed every 60 days by default (which is configurable). Once the cert is renewed, the Apache/Nginx service will be reloaded automatically by the command: service apache2 force-reload or service nginx force-reload. Please take care: The reloadcmd is very important. The cert can be automatically renewed, but, without a correct reloadcmd the cert may not be flushed to your server(like nginx or apache), then your website will not be able to show renewed cert in 60 days. 4. Use Standalone server to issue cert (requires you to be root/sudoer or have permission to listen on port 80 (TCP)) Port 80 (TCP) MUST be free to listen on, otherwise you will be prompted to free it and try again. bash acme.sh --issue --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com More examples: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert 5. Use Apache mode (requires you to be root/sudoer, since it is required to interact with Apache server) If you are running a web server, Apache or Nginx, it is recommended to use the Webroot mode. Particularly, if you are running an Apache server, you can use Apache mode instead. This mode doesnt write any files to your web root folder. Just set string "apache" as the second argument and it will force use of apache plugin automatically. sh acme.sh --issue --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com This apache mode is only to issue the cert, it will not change your apache config files. You will need to configure your website config files to use the cert by yourself. We dont want to mess your apache server, dont worry. More examples: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert 6. Use Nginx mode (requires you to be root/sudoer, since it is required to interact with Nginx server) If you are running a web server, Apache or Nginx, it is recommended to use the Webroot mode. Particularly, if you are running an nginx server, you can use nginx mode instead. This mode doesnt write any files to your web root folder. Just set string "nginx" as the second argument. It will configure nginx server automatically to verify the domain and then restore the nginx config to the original version. So, the config is not changed. sh acme.sh --issue --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com This nginx mode is only to issue the cert, it will not change your nginx config files. You will need to configure your website config files to use the cert by yourself. We dont want to mess your nginx server, dont worry. More examples: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert 7. Automatic DNS API integration If your DNS provider supports API access, we can use that API to automatically issue the certs. You dont have to do anything manually! Currently acme.sh supports: CloudFlare.com API DNSPod.cn API CloudXNS.com API GoDaddy.com API PowerDNS.com API OVH, kimsufi, soyoustart and runabove API nsupdate API LuaDNS.com API DNSMadeEasy.com API AWS Route 53 aliyun.com(阿里云) API ISPConfig 3.1 API Alwaysdata.com API Linode.com API FreeDNS (https://freedns.afraid.org/) cyon.ch Domain-Offensive/Resellerinterface/Domainrobot API Gandi LiveDNS API Knot DNS API DigitalOcean API (native) ClouDNS.net API Infoblox NIOS API (https://www.infoblox.com/) VSCALE (https://vscale.io/) Dynu API (https://www.dynu.com) DNSimple API NS1.com API DuckDNS.org API Name.com API Dyn Managed DNS API Yandex PDD API (https://pdd.yandex.ru) Hurricane Electric DNS service (https://dns.he.net) UnoEuro API (https://www.unoeuro.com/) INWX (https://www.inwx.de/) Servercow (https://servercow.de) Namesilo (https://www.namesilo.com) InternetX autoDNS API (https://internetx.com) Azure DNS selectel.com(selectel.ru) DNS API zonomi.com DNS API DreamHost.com API DirectAdmin API KingHost (https://www.kinghost.com.br/) Zilore (https://zilore.com) Loopia.se API acme-dns (https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns) TELE3 (https://www.tele3.cz) And: lexicon DNS API: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-use-lexicon-dns-api (DigitalOcean, DNSimple, DNSMadeEasy, DNSPark, EasyDNS, Namesilo, NS1, PointHQ, Rage4 and Vultr etc.) More APIs coming soon... If your DNS provider is not on the supported list above, you can write your own DNS API script easily. If you do, please consider submitting a Pull Request and contribute it to the project. For more details: How to use DNS API 8. Use DNS manual mode: See: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dns-manual-mode first. If your dns provider doesnt support any api access, you can add the txt record by your hand. bash acme.sh --issue --dns -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com You should get an output like below: ```sh Add the following txt record: Domain:_acme-challenge.example.com Txt value:9ihDbjYfTExAYeDs4DBUeuTo18KBzwvTEjUnSwd32-c Add the following txt record: Domain:_acme-challenge.www.example.com Txt value:9ihDbjxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Please add those txt records to the domains. Waiting for the dns to take effect. ``` Then just rerun with renew argument: bash acme.sh --renew -d example.com Ok, its done. Take care, this is dns manual mode, it can not be renewed automatically. you will have to add a new txt record to your domain by your hand when you renew your cert. Please use dns api mode instead. 9. Issue ECC certificates Lets Encrypt can now issue ECDSA certificates. And we support them too! Just set the keylength parameter with a prefix ec-. For example: Single domain ECC certificate bash acme.sh --issue -w /home/wwwroot/example.com -d example.com --keylength ec-256 SAN multi domain ECC certificate bash acme.sh --issue -w /home/wwwroot/example.com -d example.com -d www.example.com --keylength ec-256 Please look at the keylength parameter above. Valid values are: ec-256 (prime256v1, "ECDSA P-256") ec-384 (secp384r1, "ECDSA P-384") ec-521 (secp521r1, "ECDSA P-521", which is not supported by Lets Encrypt yet.) 10. Issue Wildcard certificates Its simple, just give a wildcard domain as the -d parameter. sh acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d *.example.com --dns dns_cf 11. How to renew the certs No, you dont need to renew the certs manually. All the certs will be renewed automatically every 60 days. However, you can also force to renew a cert: sh acme.sh --renew -d example.com --force or, for ECC cert: sh acme.sh --renew -d example.com --force --ecc 12. How to stop cert renewal To stop renewal of a cert, you can execute the following to remove the cert from the renewal list: sh acme.sh --remove -d example.com [--ecc] The cert/key file is not removed from the disk. You can remove the respective directory (e.g. ~/.acme.sh/example.com) by yourself. 13. How to upgrade acme.sh acme.sh is in constant development, so its strongly recommended to use the latest code. You can update acme.sh to the latest code: sh acme.sh --upgrade You can also enable auto upgrade: sh acme.sh --upgrade --auto-upgrade Then acme.sh will be kept up to date automatically. Disable auto upgrade: sh acme.sh --upgrade --auto-upgrade 0 14. Issue a cert from an existing CSR https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/Issue-a-cert-from-existing-CSR 15.
