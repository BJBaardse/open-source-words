Full Documentation: link The goal of this framework is to allow a game author to essentially translate the rules of a game into a series of simple functions that describe how the game state changes when a particular move is made, and the framework takes care of the rest. You will not need to write any networking or backend code. Features State Management: Game state is managed seamlessly across clients, server and storage automatically. Cross-platform Multiplayer: All clients (Web / Android / iOS) connected to the game are synced in real time. AI Framework: Create bots that are highly customizable and debuggable. Game Phases: with different game rules (including custom turn orders) per phase. Secret State: Secret information (like the opponents cards) can be hidden from the client. Prototyping: Debugging interface to simulate moves even before you render the game. Logs: Game logs with the ability to time travel (viewing the board at an earlier state). UI Agnostic: Client API for React, React Native or plain JS. Component Toolkit: Components for hex grids, cards, tokens.
