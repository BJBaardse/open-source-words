HTTP API Design Guide This guide describes a set of HTTP+JSON API design practices, originally extracted from work on the Heroku Platform API. This guide informs additions to that API and also guides new internal APIs at Heroku. We hope its also of interest to API designers outside of Heroku. Our goals here are consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding. Were looking for a good, consistent, well-documented way to design APIs, not necessarily the only/ideal way. We assume youre familiar with the basics of HTTP+JSON APIs and wont cover all of the fundamentals of those in this guide. Available for online reading and in multiple formats at gitbook. We welcome contributions to this guide. See Summary for Table of Contents. For the best reading experience, we recommend reading via GitBook.
