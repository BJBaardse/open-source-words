📚 Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file. 🤔 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets? I usually make a cheatsheet when I want to improve my skills on a programming language, a framework or a development tool. I started doing these kind of things a long time ago on Gist. To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentations and some books I have read. Feel free to take a look. You might learn new things. They have been designed to provide a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time. 📚 Table of Contents 📃 Languages View cheatsheets Command line interface Bash Imperative PHP Functional JavaScript 📦 Backend View cheatsheets Python Django Javascript Feathers.js Moleculer Node.js Sails.js 🌐 Frontend View cheatsheets Basics HTML5 Frameworks React.js Vue.js Ember.js Angular (2+) AngularJS 🗃️ Databases View cheatsheets NoSQL Redis 🔧 Tools View cheatsheets Development VIM Xcode Infrastructure Docker Kubernetes Nanobox Boxfile Nanobox CLI 🙌🏼 How to Contribute?
