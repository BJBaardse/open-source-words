selenium selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation selenium specifically provides infrastructure for the w3c webdriver specification — a platform and language neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers the project is made possible by volunteer contributors whove generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep seleniums source code is made available under the apache 2 0 license documentation narrative documentation user manual new handbook work in progress api documentation c javascript java python ruby pull requests please read contributing md before submitting your pull requests building selenium uses a custom build system aptly named crazyfun available on all fine platforms linux mac windows we are in the process of replacing crazyfun with buck so dont be alarmed if you see directories carrying multiple build directive files for reference crazyfuns build files are named build desc while bucks are named simply buck before building ensure that you have the most recent chromedriver available on your path you may have to update this from time to time to build selenium in the same directory as this file sh go build the order of building modules is determined by the build system if you want to build an individual module assuming all dependent modules have previously been built try the following sh go javascript atoms test run in this case javascript atoms is the module directory test is a target in that directorys build desc file and run is the action to run on that target as you see build targets scroll past in the log you may want to run them individually crazyfun can run them individually by target name as long as run is appended see above to list all available targets you can append the t flag sh go t buck although the plan is to return to a vanilla build of buck as soon as possible we currently use a fork hosted at https github com seleniumhq buck selenium uses buckw wrapper utility that automatically downloads buck if necessary and runs it with the specified options to obtain a list of all available targets sh buckw targets and build a particular file sh buckw build java client src org openqa selenium webdriver api there are aliases for commonly invoked targets in the buckconfig file and these aliases can be invoked directly sh buckw build htmlunit all buck output is stored under buck out with the outputs of build rules in buck out gen if you are doing a number of incremental builds then you may want to use buckd which starts a long lived buck process to watch outputs and input files if you do this consider using watchman too since the java 7 file watcher isnt terribly efficient this can be cloned from https github com facebook watchman requirements java 8 jdk java and jar on the path make sure you use java executable from jdk but not jre python 2 7 python on the path make sure its python 2 7 as buck build tool is not python 3 compatible macos users should have xcode installed although the build system is based on rake its strongly advised to rely on the version of jruby in third party that is invoked by go the only developer type who would want to deviate from this is the “build maintainer” whos experimenting with a jruby upgrade note that all selenium java artifacts are built with java 8 mandatory those will work with any java 8 optional requirements python 3 4 if you want to run python tests for this version ruby 2 0 internet explorer driver if you plan to compile the ie driver you also need visual studio 2008 32 and 64 bit cross compilers the build will work on any platform but the tests for ie will be skipped silently if you are not building on windows common tasks for an express build of the binaries we release run the following from the directory containing the rakefile sh go release all build output is placed under the build directory the output can be found under build dist if an error occurs while running this task complaining about a missing albacore gem chances are youre using rvm if this is the case switch to the system ruby sh rvm system of course building the entire project can take too long if you just want to build a single driver then you can run one of these targets sh go chrome go firefox go ie as the build progresses youll see it report where the build outputs are being placed of course just building isnt enough we should really be able to run the tests too try sh go test chrome go test firefox go test htmlunit go test ie note that the test chrome target requires that you have the separate chrome driver binary available on your path if you are interested in a single language binding try one of sh go test java go test dotnet go test rb go test javascript to run all the tests run sh go test this will detect your os and run all the tests that are known to be stable for every browser thats appropriate to use for all language bindings this can take a healthy amount of time to run to run the minimal logical selenium build sh go test javascript test java as a side note none of the developers run tests using cygwin it is very unlikely that the build will work as expected if you try to use it tour the code base is generally segmented around the languages used to write the component selenium makes extensive use of javascript so lets start there working on the javascript is easy first of all start the development server sh go debug server now navigate to http localhost 2310 javascript youll find the contents of the javascript directory being shown we use the closure library for developing much of the javascript so now navigate to http localhost 2310 javascript atoms test the tests in this directory are normal html files with names ending with test html click on one to load the page and run the test you can run all the javascript tests using sh go test javascript maven pom files here is the public selenium maven repository build output go only makes a top level build directory outputs are placed under that relative to the target name which is probably best described with an example for the target sh go java client src org openqa selenium selenium api the output is found under sh build java client src org openqa selenium selenium api jar if you watch the build each step should print where its output is going java test outputs appear in one of two places either under build test logs for junit or in build build log xml for testng tests if youd like the build to be chattier just append log true to the build command line help with go more general but basic help for go… sh go help go is just a wrapper around rake so you can use the standard commands such as rake t to get more information about available targets maven per se if it is not clear already selenium is not built with maven it is built with buck though that is invoked with go as outlined above so you do not really have to learn too much about that that said it is possible to relatively quickly build selenium pieces for maven to use you are only really going to want to do this when you are testing the cutting edge of selenium development which we welcome against your application here is the quickest way to build and deploy into your local maven repository m2 repository while skipping seleniums own tests sh go maven install the maven jars should now be in your local m2 repository you can also publish directly using buck sh buckw publish r your repo java client src org openqa selenium selenium this sequence will push some seven or so jars into your local maven repository with something like selenium server 3 0 0 jar as the name useful resources refer to the building web driver wiki page for the last word on building the bits and pieces of selenium
