Cayley is an open-source graph inspired by the graph database behind Freebase and Googles Knowledge Graph. Its goal is to be a part of the developers toolbox where Linked Data and graph-shaped data (semantic webs, social networks, etc) in general are concerned. Features Community driven Written in Go can be used as a Go library Easy to get running (3 or 4 commands) RESTful API or a REPL if you prefer Built-in query editor and visualizer Multiple query languages: Gizmo - a JavaScript, with a Gremlin-inspired* graph object. GraphQL-inspired* query language. (simplified) MQL, for Freebase fans Plays well with multiple backend stores: KVs: Bolt, LevelDB NoSQL: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, CouchDB/PouchDB SQL: PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, MySQL In-memory, ephemeral Modular design; easy to extend with new languages and backends Good test coverage Speed, where possible. Rough performance testing shows that, on 2014 consumer hardware and an average disk, 134m quads in LevelDB is no problem and a multi-hop intersection query -- films starring X and Y -- takes ~150ms.
