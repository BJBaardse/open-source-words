Sometimes ciphers are deemed vulnerable, so when you are changing configuration, this can be used to confirm that the cipher truly is disabled. Some browsers (For example old versions of IE) dont support some of the newer ciphers, which would be a good example of when a SysAdmin would need a list of currently supported ciphers so that changes can be made.
