Passport Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js. Passports sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails. Status: Sponsorship Passport is open source software. Ongoing development is made possible by generous contributions from individuals and corporations.

Install $ npm install passport Usage Strategies Passport uses the concept of strategies to authenticate requests. Strategies can range from verifying username and password credentials, delegated authentication using OAuth (for example, via Facebook or Twitter), or federated authentication using OpenID. Before authenticating requests, the strategy (or strategies) used by an application must be configured. javascript passport.use(new LocalStrategy( function(username, password, done) { User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) { if (err) { return done(err); } if (!user) { return done(null, false); } if (!user.verifyPassword(password)) { return done(null, false); } return done(null, user); }); } )); There are 480+ strategies. Find the ones you want at: passportjs.org Sessions Passport will maintain persistent login sessions. In order for persistent sessions to work, the authenticated user must be serialized to the session, and deserialized when subsequent requests are made. Passport does not impose any restrictions on how your user records are stored. Instead, you provide functions to Passport which implements the necessary serialization and deserialization logic. In a typical application, this will be as simple as serializing the user ID, and finding the user by ID when deserializing. ```javascript passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) { done(null, user.id); }); passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) { User.findById(id, function (err, user) { done(err, user); }); }); ``` Middleware To use Passport in an Express or Connect-based application, configure it with the required passport.initialize() middleware. If your application uses persistent login sessions (recommended, but not required), passport.session() middleware must also be used. javascript var app = express(); app.use(require(serve-static)(__dirname + /../../public)); app.use(require(cookie-parser)()); app.use(require(body-parser).urlencoded({ extended: true })); app.use(require(express-session)({ secret: keyboard cat, resave: true, saveUninitialized: true })); app.use(passport.initialize()); app.use(passport.session()); Authenticate Requests Passport provides an authenticate() function, which is used as route middleware to authenticate requests. javascript app.post(/login, passport.authenticate(local, { failureRedirect: /login }), function(req, res) { res.redirect(/); }); Strategies Passport has a comprehensive set of over 480 authentication strategies covering social networking, enterprise integration, API services, and more. Search all strategies There is a Strategy Search at passportjs.org The following table lists commonly used strategies: |Strategy | Protocol |Developer | |---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------| |Local | HTML form |Jared Hanson | |OpenID | OpenID |Jared Hanson | |BrowserID | BrowserID |Jared Hanson | |Facebook | OAuth 2.0 |Jared Hanson | |Google | OpenID |Jared Hanson | |Google | OAuth / OAuth 2.0 |Jared Hanson | |Twitter | OAuth |Jared Hanson | |Azure Active Directory | OAuth 2.0 / OpenID / SAML |Azure | Examples For a complete, working example, refer to the example that uses passport-local.
