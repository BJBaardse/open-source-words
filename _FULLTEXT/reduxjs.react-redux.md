React Redux Official React bindings for Redux. Performant and flexible. Installation React Redux requires React 0.14 or later. npm install --save react-redux This assumes that youre using npm package manager with a module bundler like Webpack or Browserify to consume CommonJS modules. If you dont yet use npm or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file UMD build that makes ReactRedux available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from cdnjs. We dont recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on npm. React Native As of React Native 0.18, React Redux 5.x should work with React Native. If you have any issues with React Redux 5.x on React Native, run npm ls react and make sure you dont have a duplicate React installation in your node_modules. We recommend that you use npm@3.x which is better at avoiding these kinds of issues. If you are on an older version of React Native, youll need to keep using React Redux 3.x branch and documentation because of this problem.
