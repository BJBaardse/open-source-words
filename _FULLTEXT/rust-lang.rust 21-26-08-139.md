the rust programming language this is the main source code repository for rust it contains the compiler standard library and documentation quick start read installation from the book building from source building on nix make sure you have installed the dependencies g 4 7 or later or clang 3 x or later python 2 7 but not 3 x gnu make 3 81 or later cmake 3 4 3 or later curl git clone the source with git sh git clone https github com rust lang rust git cd rust build and install sh git submodule update init recursive progress x py build sudo x py install note install locations can be adjusted by copying the config file from config toml example to config toml and adjusting the prefix option under install various other options such as enabling debug information are also supported and are documented in the config file when complete sudo x py install will place several programs into usr local bin rustc the rust compiler and rustdoc the api documentation tool this install does not include cargo rusts package manager which you may also want to build building on windows there are two prominent abis in use on windows the native msvc abi used by visual studio and the gnu abi used by the gcc toolchain which version of rust you need depends largely on what c c libraries you want to interoperate with for interop with software produced by visual studio use the msvc build of rust for interop with gnu software built using the mingw msys2 toolchain use the gnu build mingw msys2 can be used to easily build rust on windows grab the latest msys2 installer and go through the installer run mingw32 shell bat or mingw64 shell bat from wherever you installed msys2 i e c \msys64 depending on whether you want 32 bit or 64 bit rust as of the latest version of msys2 you have to run msys2 shell cmd mingw32 or msys2 shell cmd mingw64 from the command line instead from this terminal install the required tools sh update package mirrors may be needed if you have a fresh install of msys2 pacman sy pacman mirrors install build tools needed for rust if youre building a 32 bit compiler then replace x86 64 below with i686 if youve already got git python or cmake installed and in path you can remove them from this list note that it is important that you do not use the python2 and cmake packages from the msys2 subsystem the build has historically been known to fail with these packages pacman s git \ make \ diffutils \ tar \ mingw w64 x86 64 python2 \ mingw w64 x86 64 cmake \ mingw w64 x86 64 gcc navigate to rusts source code or clone it then build it sh x py build x py install msvc msvc builds of rust additionally require an installation of visual studio 2013 or later so rustc can use its linker make sure to check the “c tools” option with these dependencies installed you can build the compiler in a cmd exe shell with sh python x py build currently building rust only works with some known versions of visual studio if you have a more recent version installed the build system doesnt understand then you may need to force rustbuild to use an older version this can be done by manually calling the appropriate vcvars file before running the bootstrap call c \program files x86 \microsoft visual studio 14 0\vc\bin\amd64\vcvars64 bat python x py build specifying an abi each specific abi can also be used from either environment for example using the gnu abi in powershell by using an explicit build triple the available windows build triples are gnu abi using gcc i686 pc windows gnu x86 64 pc windows gnu the msvc abi i686 pc windows msvc x86 64 pc windows msvc the build triple can be specified by either specifying build triple when invoking x py commands or by copying the config toml file as described in building from source and modifying the build option under the build section configure and make while its not the recommended build system this project also provides a configure script and makefile the latter of which just invokes x py sh configure make sudo make install when using the configure script the generated config mk file may override the config toml file to go back to the config toml file delete the generated config mk file building documentation if youd like to build the documentation its almost the same sh x py doc the generated documentation will appear under doc in the build directory for the abi used i e if the abi was x86 64 pc windows msvc the directory will be build\x86 64 pc windows msvc\doc notes since the rust compiler is written in rust it must be built by a precompiled snapshot version of itself made in an earlier stage of development as such source builds require a connection to the internet to fetch snapshots and an os that can execute the available snapshot binaries snapshot binaries are currently built and tested on several platforms platform architecture x86 x86 64 windows 7 8 server 2008 r2 ✓ ✓ linux 2 6 18 or later ✓ ✓ osx 10 7 lion or later ✓ ✓ you may find that other platforms work but these are our officially supported build environments that are most likely to work rust currently needs between 600mib and 1 5gib of ram to build depending on platform if it hits swap it will take a very long time to build there is more advice about hacking on rust in contributing md getting help the rust community congregates in a few places stack overflow direct questions about using the language users rust lang org general discussion and broader questions r rust news and general discussion contributing to contribute to rust please see contributing rust has an irc culture and most real time collaboration happens in a variety of channels on mozillas irc network irc mozilla org the most popular channel is rust a venue for general discussion about rust and a good place to ask for help would be rust beginners the rustc guide might be a good place to start if you want to find out how various parts of the compiler work also you may find the rustdocs for the compiler itself useful
