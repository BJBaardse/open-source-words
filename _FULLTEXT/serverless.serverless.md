This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster. The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. Its a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. Its also completely extensible via plugins. Serverless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team. Watch the video guide here. Serverless Framework Feedback Survey Contents Quick Start Examples Services Features Plugins Example Projects Contributing Community Consultants Licensing Previous Version 0.5.x Quick Start Watch the video guide here or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes. Install via npm: bash npm install -g serverless Set-up your Provider Credentials. Watch the video on setting up credentials Create a Service: You can create a new service or install existing services. bash # Create a new Serverless Service/Project serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service # Change into the newly created directory cd my-service Deploy a Service: Use this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in serverless.yml or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time. bash serverless deploy -v Deploy the Function: Use this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster. bash serverless deploy function -f hello Invoke the Function: Invokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs. bash serverless invoke -f hello -l Fetch the Function Logs: Open up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command. bash serverless logs -f hello -t Remove the Service: Removes all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account. bash serverless remove How to Install a Service: This is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below. bash serverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service Check out the Serverless Framework Guide for more information. Services (V1.0) The following are services you can instantly install and use by running serverless install --url <service-github-url> serverless-examples CRUD - CRUD service, Scala Port CRUD with FaunaDB - CRUD service using FaunaDB CRUD with S3 - CRUD service using S3 GraphQL Boilerplate - GraphQL application Boilerplate service Authentication - Authentication boilerplate service Mailer - Service for sending emails Kinesis streams - Service to showcase Kinesis stream support DynamoDB streams - Service to showcase DynamoDB stream support Landingpage backend - Landingpage backend service to store E-Mail addresses Facebook Messenger Chatbot - Chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform Lambda chaining - Service which chains Lambdas through SNS Secured API - Service which exposes an API key accessible API Authorizer - Service that uses API Gateway custom authorizers Thumbnails - Service that takes an image url and returns a 100x100 thumbnail Boilerplate - Opinionated boilerplate ES6 + Jest - ES6 + Jest Boilerplate PHP - Call a PHP function from your lambda Ruby - Call a Ruby function from your lambda Slack App - Slack App Boilerplate with OAuth and Bot actions Swift - Full-featured project template to develop Lambda functions in Swift Cloudwatch Alerts on Slack - Get AWS Cloudwatch alerts notifications on Slack Note: the serverless install command will only work on V1.0 or later. Features Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Scala, C#, F#, Go, Groovy, Kotlin, PHP & Swift. Manages the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete). Safely deploy functions, events and their required resources together via provider resource managers (e.g., AWS CloudFormation). Functions can be grouped ("serverless services") for easy management of code, resources & processes, across large projects & teams. Minimal configuration and scaffolding. Built-in support for multiple stages. Optimized for CI/CD workflows. Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices. 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins. An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins. A passionate and welcoming community! Plugins (V1.0) Use these plugins to extend or overwrite the Frameworks functionality.
