rxswift reactivex for swift rxswift 3 x swift 3 x can be found in rxswift 3 0 branch rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through observable element interface this is a swift version of rx it tries to port as many concepts from the original version as possible but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with ios macos environment cross platform documentation can be found on reactivex io like the original rx its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event data streams kvo observing async operations and streams are all unified under abstraction of sequence this is the reason why rx is so simple elegant and powerful i came here because i want to understand why use rx the basics getting started with rxswift traits what are single completable maybe driver controlproperty and variable and why do they exist testing tips and common errors debugging the math behind rx what are hot and cold observable sequences install integrate rxswift rxcocoa with my app installation guide hack around with the example app running example app with operators in playgrounds playgrounds interact all of this is great but it would be nice to talk with other people using rxswift and exchange experiences join slack channel report a problem using the library open an issue with bug template request a new feature open an issue with feature request template help out check out contribution guide compare with other libraries find compatible libraries from rxswiftcommunity pods using rxswift see the broader vision does this exist for android rxjava where is all of this going what is the future what about reactive architectures how do you design entire apps this way cycle js this is javascript but rxjs is javascript version of rx usage heres an example in action define search for github repositories let searchresults searchbar rx text orempty throttle 0 3 scheduler mainscheduler instance distinctuntilchanged flatmaplatest query observable repository in if query isempty return just return searchgithub query catcherrorjustreturn observeon mainscheduler instance then bind the results to your tableview searchresults bind to tableview rx items cellidentifier cell index repository repository cell in cell textlabel text repository name cell detailtextlabel text repository url disposed by disposebag requirements xcode 9 0 swift 4 0 swift 3 x use rxswift 3 0 branch instead swift 2 3 use rxswift 2 0 branch instead installation rx doesnt contain any external dependencies these are currently the supported options manual open rx xcworkspace choose rxexample and hit run this method will build everything and run the sample app cocoapods tested with pod version 1 3 1 ruby podfile use frameworks target your target name do pod rxswift 4 0 pod rxcocoa 4 0 end rxtest and rxblocking make the most sense in the context of unit integration tests target your testing target do pod rxblocking 4 0 pod rxtest 4 0 end replace your target name and then in the podfile directory type bash pod install carthage tested with carthage version 0 26 2 add this to cartfile github reactivex rxswift 4 0 bash carthage update swift package manager tested with swift build version swift 4 0 0 dev swiftpm 13126 create a package swift file swift swift tools version 4 0 import packagedescription let package package name rxtestproject dependencies package url https github com reactivex rxswift git 4 0 0 5 0 0 targets target name rxtestproject dependencies rxswift rxcocoa bash swift build to build or test a module with rxtest dependency set test 1 rxswift 3 4 2 bash test 1 swift test manually using git submodules add rxswift as a submodule bash git submodule add git github com reactivex rxswift git drag rx xcodeproj into project navigator go to project targets build phases link binary with libraries click and select rxswift platform and rxcocoa platform targets references http reactivex io reactive extensions github github rxswift raywenderlich com book boxue io rxswift online course chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ erik meijer wikipedia expert to expert brian beckman and erik meijer inside the net reactive framework rx video reactive programming overview jafar husain from netflix subject observer is dual to iterator paper rx standard sequence operators visualized visualization tool haskell
