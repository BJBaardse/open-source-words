timer timer start 10 timer timer start 20 timer timetable html syntax is the de facto language on the web and its designed for building user interfaces the syntax is explicit nesting is inherent to the language and attributes offer a clean way to provide options for custom tags expressions bindings absolutely the smallest possible amount of dom updates and reflows one way data flow updates and unmounts are propagated downwards from parent to children expressions are pre compiled and cached for high performance lifecycle events for more control close to standards no proprietary event system event normalization the rendered dom can be freely manipulated with other tools no extra html root elements or data attributes plays well with any frontend framework use your dearest language and tools create tags with coffeescript jade livescript typescript es6 or any pre processor you want integrate with npm commonjs amd bower or component develop with gulp grunt wintersmith webpack rollup
