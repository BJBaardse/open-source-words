hystrix latency and fault tolerance for distributed systems hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems services and 3rd party libraries stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable full documentation see the wiki for full documentation examples operational details and other information see the javadoc for the api communication google group hystrixoss twitter hystrixoss github issues what does it do 1 latency and fault tolerance stop cascading failures fallbacks and graceful degradation fail fast and rapid recovery thread and semaphore isolation with circuit breakers 2 realtime operations realtime monitoring and configuration changes watch service and property changes take effect immediately as they spread across a fleet be alerted make decisions affect change and see results in seconds 3 concurrency parallel execution concurrency aware request caching automated batching through request collapsing hello world code to be isolated is wrapped inside the run method of a hystrixcommand similar to the following java public class commandhelloworld extends hystrixcommand private final string name public commandhelloworld string name super hystrixcommandgroupkey factory askey examplegroup this name name override protected string run return hello name this command could be used like this java string s new commandhelloworld bob execute future string s new commandhelloworld bob queue observable string s new commandhelloworld bob observe more examples and information can be found in the how to use section example source code can be found in the hystrix examples module binaries binaries and dependency information for maven ivy gradle and others can be found at http search maven org change history and version numbers changelog md example for maven xml dependency groupid com netflix hystrix groupid artifactid hystrix core artifactid version x y z version dependency and for ivy xml dependency org com netflix hystrix name hystrix core rev x y z if you need to download the jars instead of using a build system create a maven pom file like this with the desired version xml xml version 1 0 project xmlns http maven apache org pom 4 0 0 xmlns xsi http www w3 org 2001 xmlschema instance xsi schemalocation http maven apache org pom 4 0 0 http maven apache org xsd maven 4 0 0 xsd modelversion 4 0 0 modelversion groupid com netflix hystrix download groupid artifactid hystrix download artifactid version 1 0 snapshot version name simple pom to download hystrix core and dependencies name url http github com netflix hystrix url dependencies dependency groupid com netflix hystrix groupid artifactid hystrix core artifactid version x y z version scope dependency dependencies project then execute mvn f download hystrix pom xml dependency copy dependencies it will download hystrix core jar and its dependencies into target dependency you need java 6 or later build to build git clone git github com netflix hystrix git cd hystrix gradlew build futher details on building can be found on the getting started page of the wiki run demo to run a demo app do the following git clone git github com netflix hystrix git cd hystrix gradlew rundemo you will see output similar to the following request getuseraccountcommand success 8ms
