PHP-ML - Machine Learning library for PHP Fresh approach to Machine Learning in PHP. Algorithms, Cross Validation, Neural Network, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction and much more in one library. PHP-ML requires PHP >= 7.1. Simple example of classification: ```php require_once DIR . /vendor/autoload.php; use Phpml\Classification\KNearestNeighbors; $samples = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 1], [4, 1], [4, 2]]; $labels = [a, a, a, b, b, b]; $classifier = new KNearestNeighbors(); $classifier->train($samples, $labels); echo $classifier->predict([3, 2]); // return b ``` Awards Documentation To find out how to use PHP-ML follow Documentation. Installation Currently this library is in the process of being developed, but You can install it with Composer: composer require php-ai/php-ml Examples Example scripts are available in a separate repository php-ai/php-ml-examples. Datasets Public datasets are available in a separate repository php-ai/php-ml-datasets.
