Single Element CSS Spinners This is a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS. Each spinner consists of a single div with a class of loader and content text of "Loading...". The text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers. The aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning. A strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesnt deserve more. Each loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size. Demo Check it live.
