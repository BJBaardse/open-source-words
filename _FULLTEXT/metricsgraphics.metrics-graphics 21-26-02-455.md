metricsgraphics js is a library optimized for visualizing and laying out time series data at under 80kb minified it provides a simple way to produce common types of graphics in a principled and consistent way the library currently supports line charts scatterplots histograms bar charts and data tables as well as features like rug plots and basic linear regression a sample set of examples may be found on the examples page the example below demonstrates how easy it is to produce a graphic our graphics function provides a robust layer of indirection allowing one to more efficiently build say a dashboard of interactive graphics each of which may be pulling data from a different data source for the complete list of options and for download instructions take a look at the sections below js mg data graphic title downloads description this graphics shows firefox ga downloads for the past six months data downloads data an array of objects such as value 100 date width 600 height 250 target downloads the html element that the graphic is inserted in x accessor date the key that accesses the x value y accessor value the key that accesses the y value the api is simple all thats needed to create a graphic is to specify a few default parameters and then if desired override one or more of the optional parameters on offer we dont maintain state in order to update a graphic one would call mg data graphic on the same target element the library is data source agnostic while it provides a number of convenience functions and options that allow for graphics to better handle things like missing observations it doesnt care where the data comes from though originally envisioned for mozilla metrics dashboard projects we are making this repository public for others to use knowing full well that we are far from having this project in good enough shape take a look at the issues to see the milestones and other upcoming work on this repository we are currently using semantic versioning http metricsgraphicsjs org important changes in v2 10 the library now depends on d3 4 x the impact on mg users is minimal though if you do use d3 for other work here is the list of changes from 3 x to 4 x please refer to the release notes for further details important changes in v2 0 the library is now namespaced data graphic is now mg data graphic convert dates is now mg convert date clone is now mg clone button layout is now mg button layout and data table is now mg data table we added a new convenience function called mg convert number the rollover callback option has been renamed mouseover and expanded in order to make it more consistent with other libraries we now have three callback functions available mouseover mouseout and mousemove css rules have been prefixed and in some cases updated for consistency active datapoint for instance is now mg active datapoint quick start guide download the latest release follow the examples here and here to see how graphics are laid out and built the examples use json data from examples data though you may easily pull data from elsewhere dependencies the library depends on d3 if you wish to enable tooltips or use buttons please include jquery as well versions of mg older than v2 10 depend on d3 3 whereas mg v2 10 onwards depend on d3 4 contributing if you would like to help extend metricsgraphics js or fix bugs please fork the library and install node js then from the projects root directory install gulp npm install gulp then install the librarys dependencies npm install to build the library from source type gulp build js to run tests type gulp test we have a basic development environment which uses the project source to serve up an interactive example to run it type gulp serve a development server will be available at http localhost 4300 just reload it as you make modifications to the files in src any changes made to the example source and data should be preserved the website metricsgraphicsjs org is automatically uploaded updated by travis ci when a new tag is created corresponding to a new release it is served from github pages using a netlify configuration maintained and controlled by william lachance you might also be interested in writing addons for the library in which case have a read through this page getting in touch if you have any questions about metrics graphics either as a user or contributor the best place to ask is the metricsgraphics channel on irc mozilla org learn more about irc mozilla resources examples interactive demo list of options convenience functions hooks chart types developing addons building a button layout download package the download package includes everything that you see on metricsgraphicsjs org in order to use the library in your own project the only files that youll need are the ones under dist remember to load d3 and jquery if you dont care about tooltips or the button layout you wont need the latter if your project uses bootstrap make sure you load metricsgraphics js after it frequently asked questions what does metricsgraphics js do that library x doesnt do if library x works for you you should keep using it were not aiming to be competitive with libraries that already exist were aiming to make a library that meets our needs we also happen to think that the world needs a principled data presentation library and that many of our needs are the same as other folks i only see colours for the first 10 lines in my chart what gives the colors for the first ten lines areas and legends are defined in the stylesheet for the light and dark themes for an eleventh line you would add the following css rules css mg line11 color stroke lightpink mg area11 color fill lightpink mg hover line11 color fill lightpink mg line11 legend color color lightpink if youre plotting more than five lines in the same chart and using color to encode some dimension of the data then you probably need to rethink the chart i get an error when i load mg alongside library x if your project uses bootstrap make sure you load metricsgraphics js after it if your project uses jquery ui load it after metricsgraphics js gallery feel free to add your
