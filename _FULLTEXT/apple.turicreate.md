Quick Links: Installation | Documentation | v5.0 Beta Turi Create Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You dont have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app. Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms Visual: Built-in, streaming visualizations to explore your data Flexible: Supports text, images, audio, video and sensor data Fast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine Ready To Deploy: Export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps With Turi Create, you can accomplish many common ML tasks: | ML Task | Description | |:------------------------:|:--------------------------------:| | Recommender | Personalize choices for users | | Image Classification | Label images | | Object Detection | Recognize objects within images | | Style Transfer | Stylize images | | Activity Classification | Detect an activity using sensors | | Image Similarity | Find similar images | | Classifiers | Predict a label | | Regression | Predict numeric values | | Clustering | Group similar datapoints together| | Text Classifier | Analyze sentiment of messages | Example: Image classifier with a few lines of code If you want your app to recognize specific objects in images, you can build your own model with just a few lines of code: ```python import turicreate as tc Load data data = tc.SFrame(photoLabel.sframe) Create a model model = tc.image_classifier.create(data, target=photoLabel) Make predictions predictions = model.predict(data) Export to Core ML model.export_coreml(MyClassifier.mlmodel) ``` Its easy to use the resulting model in an iOS application: Supported Platforms Turi Create supports: macOS 10.12+ Linux (with glibc 2.12+) Windows 10 (via WSL) System Requirements Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 x86_64 architecture Installation For detailed instructions for different varieties of Linux see LINUX_INSTALL.md. For common installation issues see INSTALL_ISSUES.md. We recommend using virtualenv to use, install, or build Turi Create. shell pip install virtualenv The method for installing Turi Create follows the standard python package installation steps. To create and activate a Python virtual environment called venv follow these steps: ```shell Create a Python virtual environment cd ~ virtualenv venv Activate your virtual environment source ~/venv/bin/activate Alternatively, if you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), you may use its virtual environment:shell conda create -n venv python=2.7 anaconda source activate venv ``` To install Turi Create within your virtual environment: shell (venv) pip install -U turicreate Version 5.0 (Beta) Turi Create 5.0 -- now in beta -- includes: GPU Acceleration on Macs for: * Image Classification (macOS 10.13+) * Image Similarity (macOS 10.13+) * Object Detection (macOS 10.14+) * Activity Classification (macOS 10.14+) New Task: Style Transfer Recommender model deployment Vision Feature Print model deployment To install the 5.0 beta into your virtual environment, use: shell (venv) pip install turicreate==5.0b2 Documentation The package User Guide and API Docs contain more details on how to use Turi Create. GPU Support Turi Create does not require a GPU, but certain models can be accelerated 9-13x when utilizing a GPU. Turi Create automatically utilizes Mac GPUs for the following tasks: Image Classification (macOS 10.13+) Image Similarity (macOS 10.13+) Object Detection (macOS 10.14+) Activity Classification (macOS 10.14+) For linux GPU support, see LinuxGPU.md. Building From Source If you want to build Turi Create from source, see BUILD.md. Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md.
