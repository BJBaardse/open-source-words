miscellaneous test proxytable api logo contributing and issues license installation npm install http proxy save back to top upgrading from 0 8 x click here back to top core concept a new proxy is created by calling createproxyserver and passing an options object as argument valid properties are available here javascript var httpproxy require http proxy var proxy httpproxy createproxyserver options see † †unless listen is invoked on the object this does not create a webserver see below an object will be returned with four methods web req res options used for proxying regular http s requests ws req socket head options used for proxying ws s requests listen port a function that wraps the object in a webserver for your convenience close callback a function that closes the inner webserver and stops listening on given port it is then possible to proxy requests by calling these functions javascript http createserver function req res proxy web req res target http mytarget com 8080 errors can be listened on either using the event emitter api javascript proxy on error function e or using the callback api javascript proxy web req res target http mytarget com 8080 function e when a request is proxied it follows two different pipelines available here which apply transformations to both the req and res object the first pipeline incoming is responsible for the creation and manipulation of the stream that connects your client to the target the second pipeline outgoing is responsible for the creation and manipulation of the stream that from your target returns data to the client back to top use cases setup a basic stand alone proxy server js var http require http httpproxy require http proxy create your proxy server and set the target in the options httpproxy createproxyserver target http localhost 9000 listen 8000 see † create your target server http createserver function req res res writehead 200 content type text plain res write request successfully proxied \n json stringify req headers true 2 res end listen 9000 †invoking listen triggers the creation of a web server otherwise just the proxy instance is created back to top setup a stand alone proxy server with custom server logic this example shows how you can proxy a request using your own http server and also you can put your own logic to handle the request js var http require http httpproxy require http proxy create a proxy server with custom application logic var proxy httpproxy createproxyserver create your custom server and just call proxy web to proxy a web request to the target passed in the options also you can use proxy ws to proxy a websockets request var server http createserver function req res you can define here your custom logic to handle the request and then proxy the request proxy web req res target http 127 0 0 1 5060 console log listening on port 5050 server listen 5050 back to top setup a stand alone proxy server with proxy request header re writing this example shows how you can proxy a request using your own http server that modifies the outgoing proxy request by adding a special header js var http require http httpproxy require http proxy create a proxy server with custom application logic var proxy httpproxy createproxyserver to modify the proxy connection before data is sent you can listen for the proxyreq event when the event is fired you will receive the following arguments http clientrequest proxyreq http incomingmessage req http serverresponse res object options this mechanism is useful when you need to modify the proxy request before the proxy connection is made to the target proxy on proxyreq function proxyreq req res options proxyreq setheader x special proxy header foobar var server http createserver function req res you can define here your custom logic to handle the request and then proxy the request proxy web req res target http 127 0 0 1 5060 console log listening on port 5050 server listen 5050 back to top modify a response from a proxied server sometimes when you have received a html xml document from the server of origin you would like to modify it before forwarding it on harmon allows you to do this in a streaming style so as to keep the pressure on the proxy to a minimum back to top setup a stand alone proxy server with latency js var http require http httpproxy require http proxy create a proxy server with latency var proxy httpproxy createproxyserver create your server that makes an operation that waits a while and then proxies the request http createserver function req res this simulates an operation that takes 500ms to execute settimeout function proxy web req res target http localhost 9008 500 listen 8008 create your target server http createserver function req res res writehead 200 content type text plain res write request successfully proxied to req url \n json stringify req headers true 2 res end listen 9008 back to top using https you can activate the validation of a secure ssl certificate to the target connection avoid self signed certs just set secure true in the options https http js create the https proxy server in front of a http server httpproxy createserver target host localhost port 9009 ssl key fs readfilesync valid ssl key pem utf8 cert fs readfilesync valid ssl cert pem utf8 listen 8009 https https js create the proxy server listening on port 443 httpproxy createserver ssl key fs readfilesync valid ssl key pem utf8 cert fs readfilesync valid ssl cert pem utf8 target https localhost 9010 secure true depends on your needs could be false listen 443 http https using a pkcs12 client certificate js create an http proxy server with an https target httpproxy createproxyserver target protocol https host my domain name port 443 pfx fs readfilesync path to certificate p12 passphrase password changeorigin true listen 8000 back to top proxying websockets you can activate the websocket support for the proxy using ws true in the options js create a proxy server for websockets httpproxy createserver target ws localhost 9014 ws true listen 8014 also you can proxy the websocket requests just calling the ws req socket head method js setup our server to proxy standard http requests var proxy new httpproxy createproxyserver target host localhost port 9015 var proxyserver http createserver function req res proxy web req res listen to the upgrade event and proxy the websocket requests as well proxyserver on upgrade function req socket head proxy ws req socket head proxyserver listen 8015 back to top options httpproxy createproxyserver supports the following options target url string to be parsed with the url module forward url string to be parsed with the url module agent object to be passed to http s request see nodes https agent and http agent objects ssl object to be passed to https createserver ws true false if you want to proxy websockets xfwd true false adds x forward headers secure true false if you

target requests proxytimeout timeout in millis for outgoing proxy requests timeout timeout in millis for incoming requests followredirects true false default false specify whether you want to follow redirects selfhandleresponse true false if set to true none of the weboutgoing passes are called and its your responsibility to appropriately return the response by listening and acting on the proxyres event buffer stream of data to send as the request body maybe you have some middleware that consumes the request stream before proxying it on e g if you read the body of a request into a field called req rawbody you could restream this field in the buffer option use strict const streamify require stream array const httpproxy require http proxy const proxy new httpproxy module exports req res next proxy web req res target http localhost 4003 buffer streamify req rawbody next note options ws and options ssl are optional options target and options forward cannot both be missing if you are using the proxyserver listen method the following options are also applicable ssl object to be passed to https createserver ws true false if you want to proxy websockets back to top listening for proxy events error the error event is emitted if the request to the target fail we do not do any error handling of messages passed between client and proxy and messages passed between proxy and target so it is recommended that you listen on errors and handle them proxyreq this event is emitted before the data is sent it gives you a chance to alter the proxyreq request object applies to web connections proxyreqws this event is emitted before the data is sent it gives you a chance to alter the proxyreq request object applies to websocket connections proxyres this event is emitted if the request to the target got a response open this event is emitted once the proxy websocket was created and piped into the target websocket close this event is emitted once the proxy websocket was closed deprecated proxysocket deprecated in favor of open js var httpproxy require http proxy error example http proxy server with bad target var proxy httpproxy createserver target http localhost 9005 proxy listen 8005 listen for the error event on proxy proxy on error function err req res res writehead 500 content type text plain res end something went wrong and we are reporting a custom error message listen for the proxyres event on proxy proxy on proxyres function proxyres req res console log raw response from the target json stringify proxyres headers true 2 listen for the open event on proxy proxy on open function proxysocket listen for messages coming from the target here proxysocket on data hybiparseandlogmessage listen for the close event on proxy proxy on close function res socket head view disconnected websocket connections console log client disconnected back to top shutdown when testing or running server within another program it may be necessary to close the proxy this will stop the proxy from accepting new connections js var proxy new httpproxy createproxyserver target host localhost port 1337 proxy close back to top miscellaneous if you want to handle your own response after receiving the proxyres you can do so with selfhandleresponse as you can see below if you use this option you are able to intercept and read the proxyres but you must also make sure to reply to the res itself otherwise the original client will never receive any data modify response js var option target target selfhandleresponse true proxy on proxyres function proxyres req res var body new buffer proxyres on data function data body buffer concat body data proxyres on end function body body tostring console log res from proxied server body res end my response to cli proxy web req res option proxytable api a proxy table api is available through this add on module which lets you define a set of rules to translate matching routes to target routes that the reverse proxy will talk to
