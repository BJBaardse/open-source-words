Features Rigid bodies Compound bodies Composite bodies Concave and convex hulls Physical properties (mass, area, density etc.) Restitution (elastic and inelastic collisions) Collisions (broad-phase, mid-phase and narrow-phase) Stable stacking and resting Conservation of momentum Friction and resistance Events Constraints Gravity Sleeping and static bodies Plugins Rounded corners (chamfering) Views (translate, zoom) Collision queries (raycasting, region tests) Time scaling (slow-mo, speed-up) Canvas renderer (supports vectors and textures) MatterTools for creating, testing and debugging worlds World state serialisation (requires resurrect.js) Cross-browser and Node.js support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE8+) Mobile-compatible (touch, responsive) An original JavaScript physics implementation (not a port) Install Download the edge build (master) or get a stable release and include the script in your web page: <script src="matter.js" type="text/javascript"></script> You can also install using the package managers Bower and NPM. bower install matter-js npm install matter-js Usage Visit the Getting started wiki page for a minimal usage example which should work in both browsers and Node.js. Also see the Running and Rendering wiki pages, which show how to use your own game and rendering loops. Tutorials See the list of tutorials. Examples See the examples directory which contains the source for all demos. There are even more examples on codepen. Plugins The engine can be extended through plugins, see these resources: Using plugins Creating plugins List of plugins matter-plugin-boilerplate Documentation See the API Documentation and the wiki Building and Contributing To build you must first install node.js and gulp, then run npm install This will install the required build dependencies, then run gulp dev to spawn a development server.
