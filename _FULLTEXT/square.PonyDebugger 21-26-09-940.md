ponydebugger ponydebugger is a remote debugging toolset it is a client library and gateway server combination that uses chrome developer tools on your browser to debug your applications network traffic and managed object contexts to use ponydebugger you must implement the client in your application and connect it to the gateway server there is currently an ios client and the gateway server ponydebugger is licensed under the apache licence version 2 0 http www apache org licenses license 2 0 html changes v0 4 0 2014 08 15 support nsurlsession requests for the network debugger

printing in network debugger davidapgar minor bug fixes and improvements jerryhjones conradev ryanolsonk v0 2 1 beta1 2013 01 12 bonjour support jeanregisser memory leak fix rwickliffe features network traffic debugging ponydebugger sends your applications network traffic through ponyd ponydebuggers proxy server you use inspectors network tools to debug network traffic like how you would debug network traffic on a website in google chrome ponydebugger forwards network traffic and does not sniff network traffic this means that traffic sent over a secure protocol https is debuggable currently the ios client automatically proxies data that is sent via nsurlconnection and nsurlsession methods this means that it will automatically work with afnetworking and other libraries that use nsurlconnection or nsurlsession for network requests core data browser the core data browsing feature allows you to register your applications nsmanagedobjectcontexts and browse all of its entities and managed objects you browse data from the indexeddb section in the resource tab in chrome developer tools these are read only stores at the moment there are plans to implement data mutation in a future release view hierarchy debugging ponydebugger displays your applications view hierarchy in the elements tab of the chrome developer tools as you move through the xml tree the corresponding views are highlighted in your app you can edit the displayed attributes i e frame alpha straight from the elements tab and you can change which attributes to display by giving ponydebugger an array of uiview key paths deleting a node in the elements panel will remove that node from the view hierarchy finally when a view is highlighted you can move it or resize it from the app using pan and pinch gestures an inspect mode can be entered by clicking on the magnifying glass in the lower left corner of the developer tools window in this mode tapping on a view in the ios app will select the corresponding node in the elements panel you can also hold and drag your finger around to see the different views highlighted when you lift your finger the highlighted view will be selected in the elements panel currently only a subset of the actions possible from the elements panel have been implemented there is significant room for continued work and improvement but the current functionality should prove useful nonetheless remote logging ponydebugger lets you remotely log text and object dumps via the pdlog and pdlogobjects function this lets you reduce the amount of content being logged in nslog while also allowing you to dynamically introspect objects introspected objects can be expanded recursively by property this means that you dont have to breakpoint and log in gdb or lldb to introspect an object quick start prerequisite xcodes command line tools must be installed from the downloads preference pane sh curl s https cloud github com downloads square ponydebugger bootstrap ponyd py \ python ponyd symlink usr local bin ponyd library ponydebugger this will install ponyd script to library ponydebugger bin ponyd and attempt to symlink usr local bin ponyd to it it will also download the latest chrome dev tools source then start the ponydebugger gateway server sh ponyd serve listen interface 127 0 0 1 in your browser navigate to http localhost 9000 you should see the ponygateway lobby now you need to integrate the client to your application for more detailed instructions check out the gateway server readme ponyd ponydebugger ios client the ponydebugger ios client lets you to debug your applications network requests and track your managed object contexts technical requires ios 5 0 or above uses arc automatic reference counting uses socketrocket as a websocket client installing cocoapods cocoapods automates 3rd party dependencies in objective c install the ruby gem sudo gem install cocoapods pod setup depending on your ruby installation you may not have to run as sudo to install the cocoapods gem create a podfile you must be running on ios 5 or above platform ios 5 0 pod ponydebugger 0 4 3 if you would like to use the latest version of ponydebugger point to the github repository directly pod ponydebugger git https github com square ponydebugger git install dependencies pod install when using cocoapods you must open the xcworkspace file instead of the project file when building your project manual installation extract a tarball or zipball of the repository into your project directory if you prefer you may also add the project as a submodule the ios client uses socketrocket as a dependency and it is included as a submodule cd path to yourapplication mkdir frameworks git submodule add git github com square ponydebugger git frameworks ponydebugger git submodule update init recursive add ponydebugger ponydebugger xcodeproj as a subproject in your project settings add the ponydebugger target as a target dependency in the build phases tab link libponydebugger a libsocketrocket a and the framework dependencies to your project ponydebugger and socketrocket take advantage of objective cs ability to add categories on an object but this isnt enabled for static libraries by default to enable this add the objc flag to the other linker flags build setting framework dependencies your app must be linked against the following frameworks dylibs in addition to libponydebugger a and libsocketrocket a libicucore dylib cfnetwork framework coredata framework security framework foundation framework usage ponydebuggers main entry points exist in the pddebugger singleton objective c pddebugger debugger pddebugger defaultinstance to connect automatically to the ponygateway on your lan via bonjour objective c debugger autoconnect or to open the connection to a specific host for instance ws localhost 9000 device objective c debugger connecttourl nsurl urlwithstring ws localhost 9000 device to manually close the connection objective c debugger disconnect network traffic debugging to enable network debugging objective c debugger enablenetworktrafficdebugging ponydebugger inspects network data by injecting logic into nsurlconnectiondelegate classes if you want ponydebugger to automatically find these classes for you objective c debugger forwardallnetworktraffic this will swizzle methods from private apis so you should ensure that this only gets invoked in debug builds to manually specify delegate classes objective c debugger forwardnetworktrafficfromdelegateclass myclass class these methods should be invoked before the connection is opened core data browser ponydebugger also allows you to browse your applications managed objects first enable core data debugging objective c debugger enablecoredatadebugging to register a managed object context objective c debugger addmanagedobjectcontext self managedobjectcontext withname my moc view hierarchy debugging to enable view hierarchy debugging objective c debugger enableviewhierarchydebugging ponydebugger will inject logic into uiview add remove methods to monitor changes in the view hierarchy you can also set the attributes you want to see in the elements panel by passing an array of uiview key path strings objective c debugger setdisplayedviewattributekeypaths frame hidden alpha opaque ponydebugger uses kvo to monitor changes in the attributes of all views in the hierarchy so the information in the elements panel stays fresh remote logging to enable remote logging objective c debugger enableremotelogging example usage objective c pdlog hello world this logs a simple string to the console output pdlogobjects self this logs an introspectable version of self to the console pdlogobjects my object object combination of text and introspectable object the repository contains a test application to demonstrate ponydebuggers capabilities and usage known issues improvements coredata framework must be linked even if you do not use the core data browsing functionality ios 5 1 and below in certain cases nsurlconnectiondatadelegate connection willsendrequest redirectresponse will never get called ponydebugger requires this call to know when the request was sent and will warn you with a workaround that the timestamp is inaccurate to fix the timestamp make sure that accept encoding http header in your nsurlrequest is not set by default ios will set it to gzip deflate which is usually adequate afnetworking users if you subclass afhttpclient call self setdefaultheader accept encoding value nil contributing were glad youre
