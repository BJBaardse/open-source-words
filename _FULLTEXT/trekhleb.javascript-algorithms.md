JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. B - Beginner, A - Advanced B Linked List B Doubly Linked List B Queue B Stack B Hash Table B Heap B Priority Queue A Trie A Tree A Binary Search Tree A AVL Tree A Red-Black Tree A Segment Tree - with min/max/sum range queries examples A Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) A Graph (both directed and undirected) A Disjoint Set A Bloom Filter Algorithms An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program. Brute Force - look at all the possibilities and selects the best solution A Maximum Subarray A Travelling Salesman Problem - shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city Greedy - choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future B Jump Game A Unbound Knapsack Problem A Dijkstra Algorithm - finding shortest path to all graph vertices A Prims Algorithm - finding Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for weighted undirected graph A Kruskals Algorithm - finding Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for weighted undirected graph Divide and Conquer - divide the problem into smaller parts and then solve those parts B Binary Search B Tower of Hanoi B Pascals Triangle B Euclidean Algorithm - calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) B Merge Sort B Quicksort B Tree Depth-First Search (DFS) B Graph Depth-First Search (DFS) B Jump Game A Permutations (with and without repetitions) A Combinations (with and without repetitions) Dynamic Programming - build up a solution using previously found sub-solutions B Fibonacci Number B Jump Game A Levenshtein Distance - minimum edit distance between two sequences A Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) A Longest Common Substring A Longest Increasing subsequence A Shortest Common Supersequence A 0/1 Knapsack Problem A Integer Partition A Maximum Subarray A Bellman-Ford Algorithm - finding shortest path to all graph vertices A Regular Expression Matching Backtracking - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate next solution you test if it satisfies all conditions, and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack, and go on a different path of finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used. B Jump Game A Hamiltonian Cycle - Visit every vertex exactly once A N-Queens Problem A Knights Tour A Combination Sum - find all combinations that form specific sum Branch & Bound - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of a least-cost solution to the problem, in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space tree is being used.
