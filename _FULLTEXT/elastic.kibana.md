Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch Ideally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer major number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning. Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers. | Situation | Example Kibana version | Example ES version | Outcome | | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |------------------- | ------- | | Versions are the same. | 5.1.2 | 5.1.2 | üíö OK | | ES patch number is newer. | 5.1.2 | 5.1.5 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning | | ES minor number is newer. | 5.1.2 | 5.5.0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning | | ES major number is newer. | 5.1.2 | 6.0.0 | üö´ Fatal error | | ES patch number is older. | 5.1.2 | 5.1.0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning | | ES minor number is older. | 5.1.2 | 5.0.0 | üö´ Fatal error | | ES major number is older. | 5.1.2 | 4.0.0 | üö´ Fatal error | Questions?
