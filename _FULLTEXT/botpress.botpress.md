We believe that in order to create great bots, significant time should be spent on user experience, not on the surrounding (and generic) features. Installation Botpress requires Node.js (version >= 8.2) and uses npm as package manager. npm install -g botpress Creating a bot Creating a bot is simple, you need to run botpress init in a terminal inside an empty directory: botpress init my-bot Once your bot is created, you need to run botpress start to start your bot: botpress start This will provide you with a web interface available at http://localhost:3000 and a chat window at http://localhost:3000/s/chat Contributing Thank you for your interest in Botpress.
