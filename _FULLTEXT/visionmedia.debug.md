debug A tiny JavaScript debugging utility modelled after Node.js cores debugging technique. Works in Node.js and web browsers. Installation bash $ npm install debug Usage debug exposes a function; simply pass this function the name of your module, and it will return a decorated version of console.error for you to pass debug statements to. This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole. Example app.js: ```js var debug = require(debug)(http) , http = require(http) , name = My App; // fake app debug(booting %o, name); http.createServer(function(req, res){ debug(req.method + + req.url); res.end(hello\n); }).listen(3000, function(){ debug(listening); }); // fake worker of some kind require(./worker); ``` Example worker.js: ```js var a = require(debug)(worker:a) , b = require(debug)(worker:b); function work() { a(doing lots of uninteresting work); setTimeout(work, Math.random() * 1000); } work(); function workb() { b(doing some work); setTimeout(workb, Math.random() * 2000); } workb(); ``` The DEBUG environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples: Windows command prompt notes CMD On Windows the environment variable is set using the set command. cmd set DEBUG=*,-not_this Example: cmd set DEBUG=* & node app.js PowerShell (VS Code default) PowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables. cmd $env:DEBUG = "*,-not_this" Example: cmd $env:DEBUG=app;node app.js Then, run the program to be debugged as usual. npm script example: js "windowsDebug": "@powershell -Command $env:DEBUG=*;node app.js", Namespace Colors Every debug instance has a color generated for it based on its namespace name. This helps when visually parsing the debug output to identify which debug instance a debug line belongs to. Node.js In Node.js, colors are enabled when stderr is a TTY. You also should install the supports-color module alongside debug, otherwise debug will only use a small handful of basic colors. Web Browser Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the %c formatting option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox (since version 31) and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version). Millisecond diff When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one debug() call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke debug() before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls. When stdout is not a TTY, Date#toISOString() is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below: Conventions If youre using this in one or more of your libraries, you should use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you should prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser". If you append a "*" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable. You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output. Wildcards The * character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session, you may simply do DEBUG=connect:*, or to run everything using this module simply use DEBUG=*. You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character. For example, DEBUG=*,-connect:* would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:". Environment Variables When running through Node.js, you can set a few environment variables that will change the behavior of the debug logging: | Name | Purpose | |-----------|-------------------------------------------------| | DEBUG | Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces. | | DEBUG_HIDE_DATE | Hide date from debug output (non-TTY). | | DEBUG_COLORS| Whether or not to use colors in the debug output. | | DEBUG_DEPTH | Object inspection depth. | | DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN | Shows hidden properties on inspected objects. | Note: The environment variables beginning with DEBUG_ end up being converted into an Options object that gets used with %o/%O formatters. See the Node.js documentation for util.inspect() for the complete list. Formatters Debug uses printf-style formatting. Below are the officially supported formatters: | Formatter | Representation | |-----------|----------------| | %O | Pretty-print an Object on multiple lines. | | %o | Pretty-print an Object all on a single line. | | %s | String. | | %d | Number (both integer and float). | | %j | JSON. Replaced with the string [Circular] if the argument contains circular references. | | %% | Single percent sign (%). This does not consume an argument. | Custom formatters You can add custom formatters by extending the debug.formatters object. For example, if you wanted to add support for rendering a Buffer as hex with %h, you could do something like: ```js const createDebug = require(debug) createDebug.formatters.h = (v) => { return v.toString(hex) } // â€¦elsewhere const debug = createDebug(foo) debug(this is hex: %h, new Buffer(hello world)) // foo this is hex: 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 +0ms ``` Browser Support You can build a browser-ready script using browserify, or just use the browserify-as-a-service build, if you dont want to build it yourself. Debugs enable state is currently persisted by localStorage. Consider the situation shown below where you have worker:a and worker:b, and wish to debug both. You can enable this using localStorage.debug: js localStorage.debug = worker:* And then refresh the page. ```js a = debug(worker:a); b = debug(worker:b); setInterval(function(){ a(doing some work); }, 1000); setInterval(function(){ b(doing some work); }, 1200); ``` Output streams By default debug will log to stderr, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the log method: Example stdout.js: ```js var debug = require(debug); var error = debug(app:error); // by default stderr is used error(goes to stderr!); var log = debug(app:log); // set this namespace to log via console.log log.log = console.log.bind(console); // dont forget to bind to console! log(goes to stdout); error(still goes to stderr!); // set all output to go via console.info // overrides all per-namespace log settings debug.log = console.info.bind(console); error(now goes to stdout via console.info); log(still goes to stdout, but via console.info now); ``` Set dynamically You can also enable debug dynamically by calling the enable() method : ```js let debug = require(debug); console.log(1, debug.enabled(test)); debug.enable(test); console.log(2, debug.enabled(test)); debug.disable(); console.log(3, debug.enabled(test)); ``` print : 1 false 2 true 3 false Usage : enable(namespaces) namespaces can include modes separated by a colon and wildcards. Note that calling enable() completely overrides previously set DEBUG variable : $ DEBUG=foo node -e var dbg = require("debug"); dbg.enable("bar"); console.log(dbg.enabled("foo")) => false Checking whether a debug target is enabled After youve created a debug instance, you can determine whether or not it is enabled by checking the enabled property: ```javascript const debug = require(debug)(http); if (debug.enabled) { // do stuff... } ``` You can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance to be enabled or disabled.
