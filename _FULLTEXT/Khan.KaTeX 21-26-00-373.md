katex is a fast easy to use javascript library for tex math rendering on the web fast katex renders its math synchronously and doesnt need to reflow the page see how it compares to a competitor in this speed test print quality katexs layout is based on donald knuths tex the gold standard for math typesetting self contained katex has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources server side rendering katex produces the same output regardless of browser or environment so you can pre render expressions using node js and send them as plain html katex supports all major browsers including chrome safari firefox opera edge and ie 9 ie 11 more information can be found on the list of supported commands and on the wiki usage you can download katex and host it on your server or include the katex min js and katex min css files on your page directly from a cdn html link rel stylesheet href https cdn jsdelivr net npm katex 0 10 0 beta dist katex min css integrity

render c \pm\sqrt a 2 b 2 element to avoid escaping the backslash double backslash you can use string raw but beware that \u and \x may still need escaping js katex render string raw c \pm\sqrt a 2 b 2 element if katex cant parse the expression it throws a katex parseerror error server side rendering or rendering to a string to generate html on the server or to generate an html string of the rendered math you can use katex rendertostring js var html katex rendertostring c \pm\sqrt a 2 b 2 span class katex span make sure to include the css and font files but there is no need to include the javascript like render rendertostring throws if it cant parse the expression security any html generated by katex should be safe from script or other code injection attacks see maxsize below for preventing large width height visual affronts see maxexpand below for preventing infinite macro loop attacks and see allowedprotocols below for preventing certain protocols in \href of course it is always a good idea to sanitize the html though you will need a rather generous whitelist including some of svg and mathml to support all of katex handling errors if katex encounters an error invalid or unsupported latex and throwonerror hasnt been set to false then it will throw an exception of type katex parseerror the message in this error includes some of the latex source code so needs to be escaped if you want to render it to html in particular you should convert characters to amp lt gt e g using escape before including either latex source code or exception messages in your html dom failure to escape in this way makes a script injection attack possible if your latex source is untrusted alternatively you can set throwonerror to false to use built in behavior of rendering the latex source code with hover text stating the error rendering options you can provide an object of options as the last argument to katex render and katex rendertostring available options are displaymode boolean if true the math will be rendered in display mode which will put the math in display style so \int and \sum are large for example and will center the math on the page on its own line if false the math will be rendered in inline mode default false throwonerror boolean if true the default katex will throw a parseerror when it encounters an unsupported command or invalid latex if false katex will render unsupported commands as text and render invalid latex as its source code with hover text giving the error in the color given by errorcolor errorcolor string a color string given in the format xxx or xxxxxx this option determines the color that unsupported commands and invalid latex are rendered in when throwonerror is set to false default cc0000 macros object a collection of custom macros each macro is a property with a name like \name written \name in javascript which maps to a string that describes the expansion of the macro single character keys can also be included in which case the character will be redefined as the given macro similar to tex active characters this object will be modified if the latex code defines its own macros via \gdef which enables consecutive calls to katex to share state coloristextcolor boolean if true \color will work like latexs \textcolor and take two arguments e g \color blue hello which restores the old behavior of katex pre 0 8 0 if false the default \color will work like latexs \color and take one argument e g \color blue hello in both cases \textcolor works as in latex e g \textcolor blue hello maxsize number all user specified sizes e g in \rule 500em 500em will be capped to maxsize ems if set to infinity the default users can make elements and spaces arbitrarily large maxexpand number limit the number of macro expansions to the specified number to prevent e g infinite macro loops if set to infinity the macro expander will try to fully expand as in latex default 1000 allowedprotocols string allowed protocols in \href use relative to allow relative urls and to allow all protocols default http https mailto relative strict boolean or string or function default warn if false or ignore allow features that make writing latex convenient but are not actually supported by xe latex similar to mathjax if true or error latex faithfulness mode throw an error for any such transgressions if warn the default warn about such behavior via console warn provide a custom function handler errorcode errormsg token to customize behavior depending on the type of transgression summarized by the string code errorcode and detailed in errormsg this function can also return ignore error or warn to use a built in behavior a list of such features and their errorcodes unknownsymbol use of unknown unicode symbol which will likely also lead to warnings about missing character metrics and layouts may be incorrect especially in terms of vertical heights unicodetextinmathmode use of unicode text characters in math mode mathvstextunits mismatch of math vs text commands and units mode a second category of errorcodes never throw errors but their strictness affects the behavior of katex newlineindisplaymode use of \ or \newline in display mode outside an array tabular environment in strict mode no line break results as in latex for example js katex render c \pm\sqrt a 2 b 2 \in\rr element displaymode true macros \rr \mathbb r automatic rendering of math on a page math on the page can be automatically rendered using the auto render extension see the auto render readme for more information font size and lengths by default katex math is rendered in a 1 21Ã— larger font than the surrounding context which makes super and subscripts easier to read you can control this using css for example css katex font size 1 1em katex supports all tex units including absolute units like cm and in absolute units are currently scaled relative to the default tex font size of 10pt so that \kern1cm produces the same results as \kern2 845275em as a result relative and absolute units are both uniformly scaled relative to latex with a 10pt font for example the rectangle \rule 1cm 1em has the same aspect ratio in katex as in latex however because most browsers default to a larger font size this typically means that a 1cm kern in katex will appear larger than 1cm in browser units common issues many markdown preprocessors such as the one that jekyll and github pages use have a smart quotes feature this changes to which is an issue for math containing primes e g f this can be worked around by defining a single character macro which changes them back e g katex follows latexs rendering of aligned and matrix environments unlike mathjax when displaying fractions one above another in these vertical layouts there may not be enough space between rows for people who are used to mathjaxs rendering the distance between rows can be adjusted by using \ 0 1em instead of the standard line separator distance katex does not support the align environment because latex doesnt support align in math mode the aligned environment offers the same functionality but in math mode so use that instead or define a macro that maps align to aligned mathjax defines \color to be like \textcolor by default set katexs coloristextcolor option to true for this behavior katexs default behavior matches mathjax with its color js
