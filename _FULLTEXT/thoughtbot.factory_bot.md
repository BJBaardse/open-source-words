Documentation You should find the documentation for your version of factory_bot on Rubygems. See GETTING_STARTED for information on defining and using factories. We also have a detailed introductory video, available for free on Upcase. Install Add the following line to Gemfile: ruby gem factory_bot and run bundle install from your shell. To install the gem manually from your shell, run: shell gem install factory_bot Caveat: As of ActiveSupport 5.0 and above, Ruby 2.2.2+ is required. Because of Rubygems dependency resolution when installing gems, you may see an error similar to: $ gem install factory_bot ERROR: Error installing factory_bot: activesupport requires Ruby version >= 2.2.2. To bypass this, install a pre-5.0 version of ActiveSupport before installing manually. Supported Ruby versions The factory_bot 3.x+ series supports MRI Ruby 1.9. Additionally, factory_bot 3.6+ supports JRuby 1.6.7.2+ while running in 1.9 mode. See GETTING_STARTED for more information on configuring the JRuby environment. For versions of Ruby prior to 1.9, please use factory_bot 2.x.
