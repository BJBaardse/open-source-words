PDF.js PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5. PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla Labs. Our goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and rendering PDFs. Contributing PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors.

Getting Started Online demo https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html Browser Extensions Firefox PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox. Chrome The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the Chrome Web Store. This extension is maintained by @Rob--W. Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue gulp chromium. Then open Chrome, go to Tools > Extension and load the (unpackaged) extension from the directory build/chromium. Getting the Code To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git: $ git clone git://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git $ cd pdf.js Next, install Node.js via the official package or via nvm. You need to install the gulp package globally (see also gulps getting started): $ npm install -g gulp-cli If everything worked out, install all dependencies for PDF.js: $ npm install Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening PDF files using a file:// URL. Run: $ gulp server and then you can open: http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html Please keep in mind that this requires an ES6 compatible browser; refer to Building PDF.js for usage with older browsers. It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening: http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame Building PDF.js In order to bundle all src/ files into two production scripts and build the generic viewer, run: $ gulp generic This will generate pdf.js and pdf.worker.js in the build/generic/build/ directory. Both scripts are needed but only pdf.js needs to be included since pdf.worker.js will be loaded by pdf.js. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production. Using PDF.js in a web application To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM and Bower under the pdfjs-dist name. For more information and examples please refer to the wiki page on this subject. Including via a CDN PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs: - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/ Learning You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below: Interactive examples The repository contains a hello world example that you can run locally: examples/helloworld/ More examples can be found in the examples folder. Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via gulp dist-install command.
