NVActivityIndicatorView Introduction NVActivityIndicatorView is a collection of awesome loading animations. This is original a fork from DGActivityIndicatorView, inspired by Loaders.css, written in Swift with full implementation of animations, plus more. You can also find Objective-C version of this here. Demo For first-hand experience, just open the project and run it. Animation types | Type | Type | Type | Type | |---|---|---|---| |1. ballPulse | 2. ballGridPulse | 3. ballClipRotate | 4. squareSpin| |5. ballClipRotatePulse | 6. ballClipRotateMultiple | 7. ballPulseRise | 8. ballRotate| |9. cubeTransition | 10. ballZigZag | 11. ballZigZagDeflect | 12. ballTrianglePath| |13. ballScale | 14. lineScale | 15. lineScaleParty | 16. ballScaleMultiple| |17. ballPulseSync | 18. ballBeat | 19. lineScalePulseOut | 20. lineScalePulseOutRapid| |21. ballScaleRipple | 22. ballScaleRippleMultiple | 23. ballSpinFadeLoader | 24. lineSpinFadeLoader| |25. triangleSkewSpin | 26. pacman | 27. ballGridBeat | 28. semiCircleSpin| |29. ballRotateChase | 30. orbit | 31. audioEqualizer | 32. circleStrokeSpin| Installation Cocoapods Install Cocoapods if need be. bash $ gem install cocoapods Add NVActivityIndicatorView in your Podfile. ```ruby use_frameworks! pod NVActivityIndicatorView ``` Then, run the following command. bash $ pod install Carthage Install Carthage if need be. bash $ brew update $ brew install carthage Add NVActivityIndicatorView in your Cartfile. ruby github "ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView" Run carthage to build the framework and drag the built NVActivityIndicatorView.framework into your Xcode project. Note: You might encounter compile issue, if so please use carthage branch instead. Check issue #101 for more information. Manual Copy NVActivityIndicatorView folder to your project. Thats it. Note: Make sure that all files in NVActivityIndicatorView included in Compile Sources in Build Phases. Note: If you encounter issues while uploading the app to iTunes Connect, remove the Info.plist file in NVActivityIndicatorView. Check issue #129 for more information. Migration Version 4.0.0 This version requires Xcode 9.0 and Swift 4. Version 3.7.0 This version splits NVActivityIndicatorView pod to 2 subpods NVActivityIndicatorView/Presenter and NVActivityIndicatorView/AppExtension. There is no need to change pod NVActivityIndicatorView to pod NVActivityIndicatorView/Presenter since it will be installed by default if you use the main pod name. However, if you want to use NVActivityIndicatorView in app extension, use pod NVActivityIndicatorView/AppExtension instead. Note: Related issue #119. Version 3.6.0 This version requires Xcode 8.3 and Swift 3.1. Version 3.0 This version requires Xcode 8.0 and Swift 3. NVActivityIndicatorView.startAnimation() and NVActivityIndicatorView.stopAnimation() are deleted. Use NVActivityIndicatorView.startAnimating() and NVActivityIndicatorView.stopAnimating() instead. UIViewController.startActivityAnimating() and UIViewController.stopActivityAnimating() are deleted. Use UIViewController.startAnimating() and UIViewController.stopAnimating() instead. Version 2.0 This version continues to spport Xcode 7.0 and Swift 2.2 and earlier. For Swift 2.3 support, use swift2.3 branch instead. ruby pod NVActivityIndicatorView, :git => https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView.git, :branch => swift2.3 Usage Firstly, import NVActivityIndicatorView. swift import NVActivityIndicatorView Initialization Then, there are two ways you can create NVActivityIndicatorView: By storyboard, changing class of any UIView to NVActivityIndicatorView. Note: Set Module to NVActivityIndicatorView. By code, using initializer. All parameters other than frame are optional and NVActivityIndicatorView.DEFAULT_* are used as default values. swift NVActivityIndicatorView(frame: frame, type: type, color: color, padding: padding) Control Start animating. swift activityIndicatorView.startAnimating() Stop animating. swift activityIndicatorView.stopAnimating() Determine if it is animating. swift animating = activityIndicatorView.isAnimating Change properties In storyboard, you can change all properties in Attributes inspector tab of Utilities panel. Note: Use one of values (case-insensitive) in Animation types for Type Name. All properties are public so you can change them after initializing. Note: All changes must be made before calling startAnimating(). UI blocker By conforming NVActivityIndicatorViewable protocol, you can use NVActivityIndicatorView as UI blocker for UIViewController. swift class ViewController: UIViewController, NVActivityIndicatorViewable { } Start animating. swift startAnimating(size, message) // plus other parameters as in initializer. Stop animating. swift stopAnimating() Check if it is animating. swift animating = isAnimating Or you can use NVActivityIndicatorPresenter to display UI blocker anywhere. Start animating. ```swift let activityData = ActivityData() NVActivityIndicatorPresenter.sharedInstance.startAnimating(activityData) ``` Note: Check documentation for detail of ActivityData. Stop animating. swift NVActivityIndicatorPresenter.sharedInstance.stopAnimating() Change message. swift NVActivityIndicatorPresenter.sharedInstance.setMessage("Done") Check if it is animating. swift animating = NVActivityIndicatorPresenter.sharedInstance.isAnimating Fade in/out animation You have control over showing and hiding UI blocker animation. swift startAnimating(fadeInAnimation: fadeInAnimation) stopAnimating(fadeOutAnimation) Check DEFAULT_FADE_IN_ANIMATION and DEFAULT_FADE_OUT_ANIMATION for examples of how to implement animation.
