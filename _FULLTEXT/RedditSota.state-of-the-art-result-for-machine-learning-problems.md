State-of-the-art result for all Machine Learning Problems LAST UPDATE: 17th November 2017 NEWS: I am looking for a Collaborator esp who does research in NLP, Computer Vision and Reinforcement learning. If you are not a researcher, but you are willing, contact me. Email me: redditsota@gmail.com This repository provides state-of-the-art (SoTA) results for all machine learning problems. We do our best to keep this repository up to date. If you do find a problems SoTA result is out of date or missing, please raise this as an issue (with this information: research paper name, dataset, metric, source code and year). We will fix it immediately. You can also submit this Google Form if you are new to Github. This is an attempt to make one stop for all types of machine learning problems state of the art result. I can not do this alone. I need help from everyone. Please submit the Google form/raise an issue if you find SOTA result for a dataset. Please share this on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media.
