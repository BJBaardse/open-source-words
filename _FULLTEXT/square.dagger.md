Dagger 1 A fast dependency injector for Android and Java. Deprecated â€“ Please upgrade to Dagger 2 Squares Dagger 1.x is deprecated in favor of Googles Dagger 2. Please see the migration guide for help with the upgrade. Download Dagger 1 You will need to include the dagger-${dagger.version}.jar in your applications runtime. In order to activate code generation you will need to include dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar in your build at compile time. In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section of your pom.xml (replacing ${dagger.version} with the appropriate current release), and the dagger-compiler artifact as an "optional" or "provided" dependency: xml <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId> <artifactId>dagger</artifactId> <version>${dagger.version}</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId> <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId> <version>${dagger.version}</version> <optional>true</optional> </dependency> </dependencies> You can also find downloadable .jars on Maven Central. Youll need Dagger, JavaPoet, and javax.inject. Snapshots of the development version are available in Sonatypes snapshots repository. License Copyright 2012 Square, Inc.
