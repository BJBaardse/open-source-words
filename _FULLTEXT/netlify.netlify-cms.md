Netlify CMS A CMS for static site generators. Give non-technical users a simple way to edit and add content to any site built with a static site generator. How it works Netlify CMS is a single-page app that you pull into the /admin part of your site. It presents a clean UI for editing content stored in a Git repository. You setup a YAML config to describe the content model of your site, and typically tweak the main layout of the CMS a bit to fit your own site. When a user navigates to /admin theyll be prompted to login, and once authenticated theyll be able to create new content or edit existing content. Read more about Netlify CMS Core Concepts. Installation and Configuration The Netlify CMS can be used in two different ways. A Quick and easy install, that just requires you to create a single HTML file and a configuration file. All the CMS Javascript and CSS are loaded from a CDN. To learn more about this installation method, refer to the Quick Start Guide A complete, more complex install, that gives you more flexibility but requires that you use a static site builder with a build system that supports npm packages. Community Netlify CMS has a Gitter community where members of the community hang out and share things about the project, as well as give and receive support.
