So to further improve docz weve created a roadmap that you can see the next features and improvements and give your feedback about: 🤔 Why? The open source world with tools that make developers life easier and the creation of styleguides and design systems are growing and evolving so fast. New and impressive things are arising every day. Tools that allow us to evolve together are really necessary nowadays. We cant create barriers or lose time with tasks that should be trivial for us. To break barriers and facilitate the creation of tools was the purpose that Docz arose. Document our things is one of the most important and painful process that exist when youre creating something new. We lose a lot of our precious time with unnecessary setups to be able to build something that can represent and express what we want with our own style. 👉🏻 More info on our website Introduction Getting Started Writing MDX Documenting your Things Customizing Deploying your docs Documentation Project Configuration Components API Creating Themes CreatingPlugins Themes Plugins 🗃 Examples | name | description | | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | | basic | Some basic example | | using typescript | Using docz with Typescript | | using flow | Using docz with Flow | | using babel@6 | Using docz with Babel@6 | | with sass | Using docz parsing css with Sass | | with less | Using docz parsing css with Less | | with postcss | Using docz parsing css with PostCSS | | with stylus | Using docz parsing css with Stylus | 🎛 Plugins docz-plugin-babel6: Use this plugin to use older babel version docz-plugin-css: Plugin to parse css files inside your documents 🚧 Warning!
