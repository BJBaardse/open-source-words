pytorch is a python package that provides two high level features tensor computation like numpy with strong gpu acceleration deep neural networks built on a tape based autograd system you can reuse your favorite python packages such as numpy scipy and cython to extend pytorch when needed we are in an early release beta expect some adventures and rough edges more about pytorch installation binaries from source docker image previous versions getting started communication releases and contributing the team system 2 7 3 5 linux cpu linux gpu windows gpu — see also the ci pytorch org hud more about pytorch at a granular level pytorch is a library that consists of the following components torch a tensor library like numpy with strong gpu support torch autograd a tape based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable tensor operations in torch torch nn a neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility torch multiprocessing python multiprocessing but with magical memory sharing of torch tensors across processes useful for data loading and hogwild training torch utils dataloader trainer and other utility functions for convenience torch legacy nn optim legacy code that has been ported over from torch for backward compatibility reasons usually one uses pytorch either as a replacement for numpy to use the power of gpus a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed elaborating further a gpu ready tensor library if you use numpy then you have used tensors a k a ndarray pytorch provides tensors that can live either on the cpu or the gpu and accelerate compute by a huge amount we provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs such as slicing indexing math operations linear algebra reductions and they are fast dynamic neural networks tape based autograd pytorch has a unique way of building neural networks using and replaying a tape recorder most frameworks such as tensorflow theano caffe and cntk have a static view of the world one has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again changing the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch with pytorch we use a technique called reverse mode auto differentiation which allows you to change the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead our inspiration comes from several research papers on this topic as well as current and past work such as torch autograd autograd chainer etc while this technique is not unique to pytorch its one of the fastest implementations of it to date you get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research python first pytorch is not a python binding into a monolithic c framework it is built to be deeply integrated into python you can use it naturally like you would use numpy scipy scikit learn etc you can write your new neural network layers in python itself using your favorite libraries and use packages such as cython and numba our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate imperative experiences pytorch is designed to be intuitive linear in thought and easy to use when you execute a line of code it gets executed there isnt an asynchronous view of the world when you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces understanding them is straightforward the stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined we hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines fast and lean pytorch has minimal framework overhead we integrate acceleration libraries such as intel mkl and nvidia cudnn nccl to maximize speed at the core its cpu and gpu tensor and neural network backends th thc thnn thcunn are written as independent libraries with a c99 api they are mature and have been tested for years hence pytorch is quite fast – whether you run small or large neural networks the memory usage in pytorch is extremely efficient compared to torch or some of the alternatives weve written custom memory allocators for the gpu to make sure that your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient this enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before extensions without pain writing new neural network modules or interfacing with pytorchs tensor api was designed to be straightforward and with minimal abstractions you can write new neural network layers in python using the torch api or your favorite numpy based libraries such as scipy if you want to write your layers in c c we provide a convenient extension api that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate there is no wrapper code that needs to be written you can see a tutorial here and an example here installation binaries commands to install from binaries via conda or pip wheels are on our website http pytorch org from source if you are installing from source we highly recommend installing an anaconda environment you will get a high quality blas library mkl and you get a controlled compiler version regardless of your linux distro once you have anaconda installed here are the instructions if you want to compile with cuda support install nvidia cuda 7 5 or above nvidia cudnn v6 x or above if you want to disable cuda support export environment variable no cuda 1 other potentially useful environment variables may be found in setup py if you want to build on windows visual studio 2017 and nvtx are also needed install optional dependencies on linux bash export cmake prefix path dirname which conda anaconda root directory install basic dependencies conda install numpy pyyaml mkl mkl include setuptools cmake cffi

build images with cuda support and cudnn v7 build as usual docker build t pytorch f docker pytorch dockerfile you can also pull a pre built docker image from docker hub and run with nvidia docker but this is not currently maintained and will pull pytorch 0 2 nvidia docker run rm ti ipc host pytorch pytorch latest please note that pytorch uses shared memory to share data between processes so if torch multiprocessing is used e g for multithreaded data loaders the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough and you should increase shared memory size either with ipc host or shm size command line options to nvidia docker run previous versions installation instructions and binaries for previous pytorch versions may be found on our website getting started three pointers to get you started tutorials get you started with understanding and using pytorch examples easy to understand pytorch code across all domains the api reference communication forums discuss

we expect no obvious bugs please let us know if you encounter a bug by filing an issue we appreciate all contributions if you are planning to contribute back bug fixes please do so without any further discussion if you plan to contribute new features utility functions or extensions to the core please first open an issue and discuss the feature with us sending a pr without discussion might end up resulting in a rejected pr because we might be taking the core in a different direction than you might be aware of the team pytorch is a community driven project with several skillful engineers and researchers contributing to it pytorch is currently maintained by adam paszke sam gross soumith chintala and gregory chanan with major contributions coming from 10s of talented individuals in various forms and means a non exhaustive but growing list needs to mention trevor killeen sasank chilamkurthy sergey zagoruyko adam lerer francisco massa alykhan tejani luca antiga alban desmaison andreas
