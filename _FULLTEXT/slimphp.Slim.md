Slim Framework Slim is a PHP micro-framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs. Installation Its recommended that you use Composer to install Slim. bash $ composer require slim/slim "^3.0" This will install Slim and all required dependencies. Slim requires PHP 5.5.0 or newer. Usage Create an index.php file with the following contents: ```php <?php require vendor/autoload.php; $app = new Slim\App(); $app->get(/hello/{name}, function ($request, $response, $args) { return $response->getBody()->write("Hello, " . $args[name]); }); $app->run(); ``` You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server: bash $ php -S localhost:8000 Going to http://localhost:8000/hello/world will now display "Hello, world". For more information on how to configure your web server, see the Documentation. Tests To execute the test suite, youll need phpunit. bash $ phpunit Contributing Please see CONTRIBUTING for details.
