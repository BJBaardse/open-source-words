webtorrent the streaming torrent client for node js and the web webtorrent is a streaming torrent client for node js and the browser yep thats right the browser its written completely in javascript – the language of the web – so the same code works in both runtimes in node js this module is a simple torrent client using tcp and udp to talk to other torrent clients in the browser webtorrent uses webrtc data channels for peer to peer transport it can be used without browser plugins extensions or installations its just javascript™ note webtorrent does not support udp tcp peers in browser simply include the webtorrent min js script on your page to start fetching files over webrtc using the bittorrent protocol or require webtorrent with browserify see demo apps and code examples below to make bittorrent work over webrtc which is the only p2p transport that works on the web we made some protocol changes therefore a browser based webtorrent client or web peer can only connect to other clients that support webtorrent webrtc to seed files to web peers use a client that supports webtorrent e g webtorrent desktop a desktop client with a familiar ui that can connect to web peers webtorrent hybrid a command line program or instant io a website established torrent clients like vuze have already added webtorrent support so they can connect to both normal and web peers we hope other clients will follow open source sponsors features torrent client for node js the browser same npm package insanely fast download multiple torrents simultaneously efficiently pure javascript no native dependencies exposes files as streams fetches pieces from the network on demand so seeking is supported even before torrent is finished seamlessly switches between sequential and rarest first piece selection strategy supports advanced torrent client features magnet uri support via ut metadata peer discovery via dht tracker and ut pex protocol extension api for adding new extensions comprehensive test suite runs completely offline so its reliable and fast browser webrtc environment features webrtc data channels for lightweight peer to peer communication with no plugins no silos webtorrent is a p2p network for the entire web webtorrent clients running on one domain can connect to clients on any other domain stream video torrents into a video tag webm vp8 vp9 or mp4 h 264

help with development or to hang out with some mad science hackers create a new issue to report bugs fix an issue webtorrent is an open open source project who is using webtorrent today lots of folks webtorrent api documentation read the full api documentation usage webtorrent is the first bittorrent client that works in the browser using open web standards no plugins just html5 and webrtc its easy to get started in the browser downloading a file is simple js var webtorrent require webtorrent var client new webtorrent var magneturi client add magneturi function torrent got torrent metadata console log client is downloading torrent infohash torrent files foreach function file display the file by appending it to the dom supports video audio images and more specify a container element css selector or reference to dom node file appendto body seeding a file is simple too js var dragdrop require drag drop var webtorrent require webtorrent var client new webtorrent when user drops files on the browser create a new torrent and start seeding it dragdrop body function files client seed files function torrent console log client is seeding torrent infohash there are more examples in docs get started md browserify webtorrent works great with browserify an npm package that lets you use node style require to organize your browser code and load modules installed by npm as seen in the previous examples webpack webtorrent also works with webpack a module bundler similar to browserify however webpack requires the following extra configuration js target web node fs empty if you are on webpack 1 x you will also need to add the json loader js module loaders make sure to install the json loader package npm install json loader test \ json loader json otherwise you could also directly use the pre built version via require webtorrent webtorrent min script tag webtorrent is also available as a standalone script webtorrent min js which exposes webtorrent on the window object so it can be used with just a script tag html script src webtorrent min js script the webtorrent script is also hosted on fast reliable cdn infrastructure cloudflare and maxcdn for easy inclusion on your site html script src https cdn jsdelivr net npm webtorrent latest webtorrent min js script in node js webtorrent also works in node js using the same npm package its mad science note to connect to web peers browsers in addition to normal bittorrent peers use webtorrent hybrid which includes webrtc support for node as a command line app webtorrent is also available as a command line app heres how to use it bash npm install webtorrent cli g webtorrent help to download a torrent bash webtorrent magnet uri to stream a torrent to a device like airplay or chromecast just pass a flag bash webtorrent magnet uri airplay there are many supported streaming options bash airplay apple tv chromecast chromecast mplayer mplayer mpv mpv omx jack omx default hdmi vlc vlc xbmc xbmc stdout standard out implies quiet

webtorrent modules most of the active development is happening inside of small npm packages which are used by webtorrent the node way™ when applications are done well they are just the really application specific brackish residue that cant be so easily abstracted away all the nice reusable components sublimate away onto github and npm where everybody can collaborate to advance the commons
