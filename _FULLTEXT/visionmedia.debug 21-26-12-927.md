debug a tiny javascript debugging utility modelled after node js cores debugging technique works in node js and web browsers installation bash npm install debug usage debug exposes a function simply pass this function the name of your module and it will return a decorated version of console error for you to pass debug statements to this will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole example app js js var debug require debug http http require http name my app fake app debug booting o name http createserver function req res debug req method req url res end hello\n listen 3000 function debug listening fake worker of some kind require worker example worker js js var a require debug worker a b require debug worker b function work a doing lots of uninteresting work settimeout work math random 1000 work function workb b doing some work settimeout workb math random 2000 workb the debug environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma delimited names here are some examples windows command prompt notes cmd on windows the environment variable is set using the set command cmd set debug not this example cmd set debug node app js powershell vs code default powershell uses different syntax to set environment variables cmd env debug not this example cmd env debug app node app js then run the program to be debugged as usual npm script example js windowsdebug powershell command env debug node app js namespace colors every debug instance has a color generated for it based on its namespace name this helps when visually parsing the debug output to identify which debug instance a debug line belongs to node js in node js colors are enabled when stderr is a tty you also should install the supports color module alongside debug otherwise debug will only use a small handful of basic colors web browser colors are also enabled on web inspectors that understand the c formatting option these are webkit web inspectors firefox since version 31 and the firebug plugin for firefox any version millisecond diff when actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one debug call and the next suppose for example you invoke debug before requesting a resource and after as well the nnnms will show you how much time was spent between calls when stdout is not a tty date toisostring is used making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below conventions if youre using this in one or more of your libraries you should use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names if you have more than one debuggers you should prefix them with your library name and use to separate features for example bodyparser from connect would then be connect bodyparser if you append a to the end of your name it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the debug environment variable you can then use it for normal output as well as debug output wildcards the character may be used as a wildcard suppose for example your library has debuggers named connect bodyparser connect compress connect session instead of listing all three with debug connect bodyparser connect compress connect session you may simply do debug connect or to run everything using this module simply use debug you can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a character for example debug connect would include all debuggers except those starting with connect environment variables when running through node js you can set a few environment variables that will change the behavior of the debug logging name purpose debug enables disables specific debugging namespaces debug hide date hide date from debug output non tty debug colors whether or not to use colors in the debug output debug depth object inspection depth debug show hidden shows hidden properties on inspected objects note the environment variables beginning with debug end up being converted into an options object that gets used with o o formatters see the node js documentation for util inspect for the complete list formatters debug uses printf style formatting below are the officially supported formatters formatter representation o pretty print an object on multiple lines o pretty print an object all on a single line s string d number both integer and float j json replaced with the string circular if the argument contains circular references single percent sign this does not consume an argument custom formatters you can add custom formatters by extending the debug formatters object for example if you wanted to add support for rendering a buffer as hex with h you could do something like js const createdebug require debug createdebug formatters h v return v tostring hex â€¦elsewhere const debug createdebug foo debug this is hex h new buffer hello world foo this is hex 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 0ms browser support you can build a browser ready script using browserify or just use the browserify as a service build if you dont want to build it yourself debugs enable state is currently persisted by localstorage consider the situation shown below where you have worker a and worker b and wish to debug both you can enable this using localstorage debug js localstorage debug worker and then refresh the page js a debug worker a b debug worker b setinterval function a doing some work 1000 setinterval function b doing some work 1200 output streams by default debug will log to stderr however this can be configured per namespace by overriding the log method example stdout js js var debug require debug var error debug app error by default stderr is used error goes to stderr var log debug app log set this namespace to log via console log log log console log bind console dont forget to bind to console log goes to stdout error still goes to stderr set all output to go via console info overrides all per namespace log settings debug log console info bind console error now goes to stdout via console info log still goes to stdout but via console info now set dynamically you can also enable debug dynamically by calling the enable method js let debug require debug console log 1 debug enabled test debug enable test console log 2 debug enabled test debug disable console log 3 debug enabled test print 1 false 2 true 3 false usage enable namespaces namespaces can include modes separated by a colon and wildcards note that calling enable completely overrides previously set debug variable debug foo node e var dbg require debug dbg enable bar console log dbg enabled foo false checking whether a debug target is enabled after youve created a debug instance you can determine whether or not it is enabled by checking the enabled property javascript const debug require debug http if debug enabled do stuff you can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance
