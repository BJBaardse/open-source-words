Guide The HEAD repository consists of two branches: 1. master This branch consists of the README.md file that is automatically reflected on the gethead.info website. All changes to the content of the cheat sheet as such should be directed to this file. Please follow these steps for pull requests: Modify only one tag, or one related set of tags at a time Use double quotes on attributes Dont include a trailing slash in self-closing elements — the HTML5 spec says theyre optional Consider including a link to documentation that supports your change 2. gh-pages This branch is responsible for the gethead.info website. We use Jekyll to deploy the README.md Markdown file through GitHub Pages. All website related modifications must be directed here. You may want to go through the Jekyll Docs and understand how Jekyll works before working on this branch. Contributors Check out all the super awesome contributors.
