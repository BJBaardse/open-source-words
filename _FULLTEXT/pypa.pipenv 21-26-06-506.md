pipenv python development workflow for humans pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds bundler composer npm cargo yarn etc to the python world windows is a first class citizen in our world it automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects as well as adds removes packages from your pipfile as you install uninstall packages it also generates the ever important pipfile lock which is used to produce deterministic builds the problems that pipenv seeks to solve are multi faceted you no longer need to use pip and virtualenv separately they work together managing a requirements txt file can be problematic so pipenv uses the upcoming pipfile and pipfile lock instead which is superior for basic use cases hashes are used everywhere always security automatically expose security vulnerabilities give you insight into your dependency graph e g pipenv graph streamline development workflow by loading env files installation if you\re on macos you can install pipenv easily with homebrew brew install pipenv or if you\re using fedora 28 sudo dnf install pipenv otherwise refer to the documentation for instructions ‚ú®üç∞‚ú® ‚ò§ user testimonials jannis leidel former pip maintainer pipenv is the porcelain i always wanted to build for pip it fits my brain and mostly replaces virtualenvwrapper and manual pip calls for me use it david gang this package manager is really awesome for the first time i know exactly what my dependencies are which i installed and what the transitive dependencies are combined with the fact that installs are deterministic makes this package manager first class like cargo justin myles holmes pipenv is finally an abstraction meant to engage the mind instead of merely the filesystem ‚ò§ features enables truly deterministic builds while easily specifying only what you want generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies automatically install required pythons if pyenv is available automatically finds your project home recursively by looking for a pipfile automatically generates a pipfile if one doesn\t exist automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location automatically adds removes packages to a pipfile when they are un installed automatically loads env files if they exist the main commands are install uninstall and lock which generates a pipfile lock these are intended to replace pip install usage as well as manual virtualenv management to activate a virtualenv run pipenv shell basic concepts a virtualenv will automatically be created when one doesn\t exist when no parameters are passed to install all packages packages specified will be installed to initialize a python 3 virtual environment run pipenv three to initialize a python 2 virtual environment run pipenv two otherwise whatever virtualenv defaults to will be the default other commands shell will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated run will run a given command from the virtualenv with any arguments forwarded e g pipenv run python check asserts that pep 508 requirements are being met by the current environment graph will print a pretty graph of all your installed dependencies shell completion for example with fish put this in your config fish completions pipenv fish eval pipenv completion alternatively with bash put this in your bashrc or bash profile eval pipenv completion magic shell completions are now enabled there is also a fish plugin which will automatically activate your subshells for you fish is the best shell you should use it ‚ò§ usage pipenv
