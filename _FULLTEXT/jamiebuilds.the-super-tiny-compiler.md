Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler! This is an ultra-simplified example of all the major pieces of a modern compiler written in easy to read JavaScript. Reading through the guided code will help you learn about how most compilers work from end to end. Want to jump into the code? Click here You can also check it out on Glitch Why should I care? Thats fair, most people dont really have to think about compilers in their day jobs. However, compilers are all around you, tons of the tools you use are based on concepts borrowed from compilers. But compilers are scary! Yes, they are. But thats our fault (the people who write compilers), weve taken something that is reasonably straightforward and made it so scary that most think of it as this totally unapproachable thing that only the nerdiest of the nerds are able to understand. Okay so where do I begin? Awesome! Head on over to the the-super-tiny-compiler.js file. Im back, that didnt make sense Ouch, Im really sorry. Im planning on doing a lot more work on this to add inline annotations. If you want to come back when thats done, you can either watch/star this repo or follow me on twitter for updates. Tests Run with node test.js
