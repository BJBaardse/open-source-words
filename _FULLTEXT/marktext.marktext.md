I love writing. I have used a lot of markdown editors, yet there is still not an editor that can fully meet my needs. I dont like to be disturbed when I write by some unbearable bug. Mark Text uses virtual DOM to render the page, so its high efficiency, and open source to all friends who love markdown and writing. As mentioned above, Mark Text will be open source forever. It is also hoped that all markdown lovers can contribute their own code, and develop Mark Text into a popular markdown editor. There are many markdown editors, and each editor has its own characteristics, but it is also difficult to satisfy all markdown users needs. I hope Mark Text can satisfy markdown users needs as much as possible. Although the latest Mark Text is still not perfect, we are trying to make it as perfect as we can.
