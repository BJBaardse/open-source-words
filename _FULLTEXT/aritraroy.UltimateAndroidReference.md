The goal of this project is to provide a hand-picked collection of Android libraries, tools, open-source projects, books, blogs, tutorials - you name it. This project will try to showcase only the best, most popular and well-tested resources that you will actually need and find useful rather than overwhelming you with a plethora of low-quality ones. Happy learning. :+1: Featured In :star: Spread Some :heart: Supported with :heart: by Instabug Instabug SDK allows mobile developers to receive detailed bug reports from users and testers directly from inside the app. Instabug attaches screenshots, screen recordings, network requests, device environment details, and reproduce steps with each bug report. This minimizes debugging time and helps developers in tracing weird bugs. The SDK integration takes less than one minute with only one line of code. Learn more.

Ideally, you should make it a habit to not pick up the mouse to perform most of your actions and slowly migrate towards a mouseless-workflow. Here are some of the most useful shortcuts for you to get started. (Currently, only Mac shortcuts are available. Windows and Linux shortcuts coming soon.) Must-Know Shortcuts: Never-ever-ever forget these shortcuts. | Description | Shortcut | |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------:| | Find everything (like files, classes, symbols, etc.) | Shift + Shift | | Show a list of automatic fixes and IDE suggestions at the cursor | Option + Enter | | Rename all copies of the variable/method/class at the cursor | Shift + F6 | | List all usages of the variable/method/class at the cursor | Command + Option + F7 | | Generate code (like getters, setters, constructors, method overrides) | Command + N | | Search for any action in Android Studio | Command + Shift + A | | Find text occurencesin the current file (Enter = cycle through results, Esc. = cancel) | Command + F | | Show the list of recently used files in the IDE | Command + E | | Run the app or test | Control + R | Frequently Used Shortcuts: You will surely need these quite often. | Description | Shortcut | |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------:| | Search for and open any file by name | Command + Shift + O | | Move a piece of code in upward/downward direction | Command + Shift + Up/Down | | View javadoc of symbol at cursor in pop-up | F1 | | View definition of method at cursor in pop-up | Command + Y | | Search for and list any occurrences of text | Command + Shift + F | | Comment/Uncomment all selected lines (also works in xml files) | Command + / | | Show available parameters for current method (must be inside parentheses) | Command + P | | Format code to match Android Studios default style | Command + Option + L | | Delete a complete line at one go | Command + Delete | | Navigate through classes and methods | Command + Left Click | Useful Shortcuts: These can help you level up your development workflow. | Description | Shortcut | |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------:| | Go to next highlighted error in current file | F2 | | Go to the declaration of the variable/method/class at cursor | Command + B | | Go to given line number in current file | Command + L | | Duplicate current line | Command + D | | Search for and go to any symbol (incl. variables and methods) | Command + Option + O | | Show class structure in pop-up | Command + F12 | | List recently edited files in pop-up | Command + Shift + E | | View full refactor menu | Control + T | | Collapse/expand all code blocks | Command + Shift + +/- | | Collapse/expand individual code block | Command + +/- | | Insert new line below current cursor position | Shift + Enter | | Complete statement (add braces, parentheses, semi-colon) | Command + Shift + Enter | Android Studio Live Templates Just like shortcuts, Live Templates can make your life a lot easier by generating tons of boring boilerplate code in a jiffy.
