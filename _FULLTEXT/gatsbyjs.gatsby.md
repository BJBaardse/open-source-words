The following policy will be in place during the v2 beta: We will only accept bug fixes for Gatsby v1. Any PRs opened against v1 that are not bug fixes will be closed If the bug fix is applicable to v2, we will open an additional issue to track porting the change to v2 All new features should be opened as pull requests against v2 (the master branch) Were using this policy as the Gatsby team currently spends a significant amount of time maintaining two active branches - the v1 branch and the v2 branch - wed like to limit this work to focus on getting v2 released and start working on oft-requested new features like schema snapshots and schema stitching.
