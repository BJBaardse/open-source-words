mailcheck js the javascript library and jquery plugin that suggests a right domain when your users misspell it in an email address mailcheck js is part of the mailcheck family and were always on the lookout for more ports and adaptions get in touch what does it do when your user types in user gmil con mailcheck will suggest user gmail com mailcheck will offer up suggestions for second and top level domains too for example when a user types in user hotmail cmo hotmail com will be suggested similarly if only the second level domain is misspelled it will be corrected independently of the top level domain see it live in action here installation for instant use download the minified library mailcheck min js into your javascripts directory mailcheck js is also available unminimised if you want to hack on it or have your own minimizer bower bower install save mailcheck node browserify npm install save mailcheck usage with jquery first include jquery and mailcheck into the page html script src jquery min js script script src mailcheck min js script have a text field html input id email name email type email now attach mailcheck to the text field you can declare an array of domains second level domains and top level domains you want to check against html var domains gmail com aol com var secondleveldomains hotmail var topleveldomains com net org p p var superstringdistance function string1 string2 a string distance algorithm of your choosing p p email on blur function this mailcheck domains domains optional secondleveldomains secondleveldomains optional topleveldomains topleveldomains optional distancefunction superstringdistance optional suggested function element suggestion callback code empty function element callback code mailcheck takes in two callbacks suggested and empty we recommend you supply both suggested is called when theres a suggestion mailcheck passes in the target element and the suggestion the suggestion is an object with the following members js address test the address part before the sign domain gmail com the suggested domain full test gmail com the full suggested email mailcheck does not want to get in the way of how you can show suggestions use the suggestion object to display suggestions in your preferred manner empty is called when theres no suggestion mailcheck just passes in the target element it is a good idea to use this callback to clear an existing suggestion usage without jquery mailcheck is decoupled from jquery so its usage without jquery is almost identical using the example from above you would call mailcheck run instead html script mailcheck run email yourtextinput value domains domains optional topleveldomains topleveldomains optional secondleveldomains secondleveldomains optional distancefunction superstringdistance optional suggested function suggestion callback code empty function callback code script the rest works similarly in fact the mailcheck jquery plugin just wraps mailcheck run usage on node js if youre running this on node js you can just require mailcheck to get the mailcheck object and call run on that js var mailcheck require mailcheck mailcheck run see usage without jquery above domains mailcheck has inbuilt defaults if the domains secondleveldomains or topleveldomains options arent provided we still recommend supplying your own domains based on the distribution of your users adding your own domains you can replace mailchecks default domain tld suggestions by supplying replacements to mailcheck run js mailcheck run domains customdomain com anotherdomain net replaces existing domains secondleveldomains domain yetanotherdomain replaces existing slds topleveldomains com au ru replaces existing tlds alternatively you can extend mailchecks global set of default domains and tlds by adding items to mailcheck defaultdomains and mailcheck defaulttopleveldomains js mailcheck defaultdomains push customdomain com anotherdomain net extend existing domains mailcheck defaultsecondleveldomains push domain yetanotherdomain extend existing slds mailcheck defaulttopleveldomains push com au ru extend existing tlds customization the mailcheck jquery plugin wraps mailcheck the prime candidates for customization are the methods mailcheck findclosestdomain and mailcheck stringdistance mailcheck currently uses the sift3 string similarity algorithm by siderite you can modify the inbuilt string distance function or pass in your own when calling mailcheck since mailcheck runs client side keep in mind file size memory usage and performance tests mailcheck is tested with jasmine run npm test from the command line to run the test suite alternatively you can load spec spec runner html in your browser contributing lets make mailcheck awesome were on the lookout for maintainers and contributors and do send in those pull requests to get them accepted please test your code add test cases to spec mailcheckspec js and run it across browsers yes including ie minify the plugin by running grunt in the mailcheck directory npm install should have installed a git pre commit hook that takes care of this for you upcoming features
