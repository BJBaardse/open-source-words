install uppy save we recommend installing from npm and then using a module bundler such as webpack browserify or rollup js add css uppy min css either to head of your html page or include in js if your bundler of choice supports it ‚Äî transforms and plugins are available for browserify and webpack alternatively you can also use a pre built bundle from transloadits cdn edgly in that case uppy will attach itself to the global window uppy object ‚ö†Ô∏è the bundle currently consists of most uppy plugins so this method is not recommended for production as your users will have to download all plugins when you are likely using just a few 1 add a script to the bottom of body html script src https transloadit edgly net releases uppy v0 26 0 dist uppy min js script 2 add css to head html link

thatuppy server is needed for these webcam ‚Äî snap and record those selfies üì∑ browser support we aim to support ie10 and recent versions of safari edge chrome firefox and opera faq why not just use input type file having no javascript beats having a lot of it so thats a fair question running an uploading encoding business for ten years though we found that in cases the file input leaves some to be desired we received complaints about broken uploads and found that resumable uploads are important especially for big files and to be inclusive towards people on poorer connections we also launched tus io to attack that problem uppy uploads can survive network outages and browser crashes or accidental navigate aways uppy supports editing meta information before uploading and e g cropping is planned theres the situation where people are using their mobile devices and want to upload on the go but they have their picture on instagram files in dropbox or just a plain file url from anywhere on the open web uppy allows to pick files from those and push it to the destination without downloading it to your mobile device first accurate upload progress reporting is an issue on many platforms some file validation ‚Äî size type number of files ‚Äî can be done on the client with uppy uppy integrates webcam support in case your users want to upload a picture video audio that does not exist yet a larger drag drop surface can be pleasant to work with some people also like that you can control the styling language etc uppy is aware of encoding backends often after an upload the server needs to rotate detect faces optimize for ipad or what have you uppy can track progress of this and report back to the user in different ways sometimes you might want your uploads to happen while you continue to interact on the same single page not all apps need all of these features a input type file is fine in many situations but these were a few things that our customers hit asked about enough to spark us to develop uppy why is all this goodness free transloadits team is small and we have a shared ambition to make a living from open source by giving away projects like tus io and uppy were hoping to advance the state of the art make life a tiny little bit better for everyone and in doing so have rewarding jobs and get some eyes on our commercial service a content ingestion processing platform our thinking is that if just a fraction of our open source userbase can see the appeal of hosted versions straight from the source that could already be enough to sustain our work so far this is working out were able to dedicate 80 of our time to open source and havent gone bankrupt just yet d does uppy support react yep we have uppy react components please see uppy react docs does uppy support s3 uploads yes there is an s3 plugin please check out the docs for more do i need to install special service server for uppy can i use it with rails node go php yes whatever you want on the backend will work with xhrupload plugin since it just does a post or put request heres a php backend example if you want resumability with the tus plugin use one of the tus server implementations üëåüèº and youll need uppy server if youd like your users to be able to pick files from instagram google drive dropbox or via direct urls with more services coming contributions are
