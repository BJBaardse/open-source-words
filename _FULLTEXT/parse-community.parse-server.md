Parse Server is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server works with the Express web application framework. It can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself. Getting Started Running Parse Server Locally Docker Saving an Object Connect an SDK Running elsewhere Sample Application Parse Server + Express Logging Documentation Configuration Basic Options Client Key Options Advanced Options Logging Email Verification & Password Reset Using Environment Variables Available Adapters Configuring File Adapters Support Ride the Bleeding Edge Contributing Backers Sponsors Getting Started April 2016 - We created a series of video screencasts, please check them out here: http://blog.parseplatform.org/learn/parse-server-video-series-april-2016/ The fastest and easiest way to get started is to run MongoDB and Parse Server locally. Running Parse Server Locally $ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner $ mongodb-runner start $ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test Note: If installation with -g fails due to permission problems (npm ERR! code EACCES), please refer to this link. Inside a Docker container $ docker build --tag parse-server . $ docker run --name my-mongo -d mongo $ docker run --name my-parse-server --link my-mongo:mongo -d parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://mongo/test You can use any arbitrary string as your application id and master key. These will be used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server. Thats it! You are now running a standalone version of Parse Server on your machine. Using a remote MongoDB? Pass the --databaseURI DATABASE_URI parameter when starting parse-server. Learn more about configuring Parse Server here. For a full list of available options, run parse-server --help. Saving your first object Now that youre running Parse Server, it is time to save your first object. Well use the REST API, but you can easily do the same using any of the Parse SDKs. Run the following: bash curl -X POST \ -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d {"score":1337,"playerName":"Sean Plott","cheatMode":false} \ http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore You should get a response similar to this: js { "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK", "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z" } You can now retrieve this object directly (make sure to replace 2ntvSpRGIK with the actual objectId you received when the object was created): bash $ curl -X GET \ -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \ http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore/2ntvSpRGIK json // Response { "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK", "score": 1337, "playerName": "Sean Plott", "cheatMode": false, "updatedAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z", "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z" } Keeping tracks of individual object ids is not ideal, however. In most cases you will want to run a query over the collection, like so: $ curl -X GET \ -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \ http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore ``json // The response will provide all the matching objects within theresults` array: { "results": [ { "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK", "score": 1337, "playerName": "Sean Plott", "cheatMode": false, "updatedAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z", "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z" } ] } ``` To learn more about using saving and querying objects on Parse Server, check out the Parse documentation. Connect your app to Parse Server Parse provides SDKs for all the major platforms. Refer to the Parse Server guide to learn how to connect your app to Parse Server. Running Parse Server elsewhere Once you have a better understanding of how the project works, please refer to the Parse Server wiki for in-depth guides to deploy Parse Server to major infrastructure providers. Read on to learn more about additional ways of running Parse Server. Parse Server Sample Application We have provided a basic Node.js application that uses the Parse Server module on Express and can be easily deployed to various infrastructure providers: Heroku and mLab AWS and Elastic Beanstalk Google App Engine Microsoft Azure SashiDo Digital Ocean Pivotal Web Services Back4app Gomix Flynn Parse Server + Express You can also create an instance of Parse Server, and mount it on a new or existing Express website: ```js var express = require(express); var ParseServer = require(parse-server).ParseServer; var app = express(); var api = new ParseServer({ databaseURI: mongodb://localhost:27017/dev, // Connection string for your MongoDB database cloud: /home/myApp/cloud/main.js, // Absolute path to your Cloud Code appId: myAppId, masterKey: myMasterKey, // Keep this key secret! fileKey: optionalFileKey, serverURL: http://localhost:1337/parse // Dont forget to change to https if needed }); // Serve the Parse API on the /parse URL prefix app.use(/parse, api); app.listen(1337, function() { console.log(parse-server-example running on port 1337.); }); ``` For a full list of available options, run parse-server --help. Logging Parse Server will, by default, log: to the console daily rotating files as new line delimited JSON Logs are also be viewable in Parse Dashboard. Want to log each request and response? Set the VERBOSE environment variable when starting parse-server. Usage :- VERBOSE=1 parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY Want logs to be in placed in other folder? Pass the PARSE_SERVER_LOGS_FOLDER environment variable when starting parse-server. Usage :- PARSE_SERVER_LOGS_FOLDER=<path-to-logs-folder> parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY Want to log specific levels? Pass the logLevel parameter when starting parse-server. Usage :- parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --logLevel LOG_LEVEL Want new line delimited JSON error logs (for consumption by CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging, etc.)? Pass the JSON_LOGS environment variable when starting parse-server. Usage :- JSON_LOGS=1 parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY Documentation The full documentation for Parse Server is available in the wiki. The Parse Server guide is a good place to get started. If youre interested in developing for Parse Server, the Development guide will help you get set up. Configuration Parse Server can be configured using the following options. You may pass these as parameters when running a standalone parse-server, or by loading a configuration file in JSON format using parse-server path/to/configuration.json. If youre using Parse Server on Express, you may also pass these to the ParseServer object as options. For the full list of available options, run parse-server --help. Basic options appId (required) - The application id to host with this server instance. You can use any arbitrary string. For migrated apps, this should match your hosted Parse app. masterKey (required) - The master key to use for overriding ACL security. You can use any arbitrary string. Keep it secret! For migrated apps, this should match your hosted Parse app. databaseURI (required) - The connection string for your database, i.e. mongodb://user:pass@host.com/dbname. Be sure to URL encode your password if your password has special characters. port - The default port is 1337, specify this parameter to use a different port. serverURL - URL to your Parse Server (dont forget to specify http:// or https://). This URL will be used when making requests to Parse Server from Cloud Code. cloud - The absolute path to your cloud code main.js file. push - Configuration options for APNS and GCM push. See the Push Notifications quick start. Client key options The client keys used with Parse are no longer necessary with Parse Server. If you wish to still require them, perhaps to be able to refuse access to older clients, you can set the keys at initialization time. Setting any of these keys will require all requests to provide one of the configured keys. clientKey javascriptKey restAPIKey dotNetKey Advanced options fileKey - For migrated apps, this is necessary to provide access to files already hosted on Parse. allowClientClassCreation - Set to false to disable client class creation. Defaults to true. enableAnonymousUsers - Set to false to disable anonymous users. Defaults to true. auth - Used to configure support for 3rd party authentication. facebookAppIds - An array of valid Facebook application IDs that users may authenticate with. mountPath - Mount path for the server. Defaults to /parse. filesAdapter - The default behavior (GridStore) can be changed by creating an adapter class (see FilesAdapter.js). maxUploadSize - Max file size for uploads. Defaults to 20 MB. loggerAdapter - The default behavior/transport (File) can be changed by creating an adapter class (see LoggerAdapter.js). logLevel - Set the specific level you want to log. Defaults to info. The default logger uses the npm log levels as defined by the underlying winston logger. Check Winston logging levels for details on values to specify. sessionLength - The length of time in seconds that a session should be valid for. Defaults to 31536000 seconds (1 year). maxLimit - The maximum value supported for the limit option on queries. Defaults to unlimited. revokeSessionOnPasswordReset - When a user changes their password, either through the reset password email or while logged in, all sessions are revoked if this is true. Set to false if you dont want to revoke sessions. accountLockout - Lock account when a malicious user is attempting to determine an account password by trial and error. passwordPolicy - Optional password policy rules to enforce. customPages - A hash with urls to override email verification links, password reset links and specify frame url for masking user-facing pages. Available keys: parseFrameURL, invalidLink, choosePassword, passwordResetSuccess, verifyEmailSuccess. middleware - (CLI only), a module name, function that is an express middleware. When using the CLI, the express app will load it just before mounting parse-server on the mount path. This option is useful for injecting a monitoring middleware. masterKeyIps - The array of ip addresses where masterKey usage will be restricted to only these ips. (Default to [] which means allow all ips). If youre using this feature and have useMasterKey: true in cloudcode, make sure that you put your own ip in this list. readOnlyMasterKey - A masterKey that has full read access to the data, but no write access. This key should be treated the same way as your masterKey, keeping it private. objectIdSize - The string length of the newly generated objects ids. Logging Use the PARSE_SERVER_LOGS_FOLDER environment variable when starting parse-server to save your server logfiles to the specified folder. Usage: PARSE_SERVER_LOGS_FOLDER=<path-to-logs-folder> parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY Email verification and password reset Verifying user email addresses and enabling password reset via email requires an email adapter. As part of the parse-server package we provide an adapter for sending email through Mailgun. To use it, sign up for Mailgun, and add this to your initialization code: ```js var server = ParseServer({ ...otherOptions, // Enable email verification verifyUserEmails: true, // if verifyUserEmails is true and // if emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration is undefined then // email verify token never expires // else // email verify token expires after emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration // // emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration defaults to undefined // // email verify token below expires in 2 hours (= 2 * 60 * 60 == 7200 seconds) emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration: 2 * 60 * 60, // in seconds (2 hours = 7200 seconds) // set preventLoginWithUnverifiedEmail to false to allow user to login without verifying their email // set preventLoginWithUnverifiedEmail to true to prevent user from login if their email is not verified preventLoginWithUnverifiedEmail: false, // defaults to false // The public URL of your app. // This will appear in the link that is used to verify email addresses and reset passwords. // Set the mount path as it is in serverURL publicServerURL: https://example.com/parse, // Your apps name. This will appear in the subject and body of the emails that are sent. appName: Parse App, // The email adapter emailAdapter: { module: @parse/simple-mailgun-adapter, options: { // The address that your emails come from fromAddress: parse@example.com, // Your domain from mailgun.com domain: example.com, // Your API key from mailgun.com apiKey: key-mykey, } }, // account lockout policy setting (OPTIONAL) - defaults to undefined // if the account lockout policy is set and there are more than threshold number of failed login attempts then the login api call returns error code Parse.Error.OBJECT_NOT_FOUND with error message Your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again after <duration> minute(s). After duration minutes of no login attempts, the application will allow the user to try login again. accountLockout: { duration: 5, // duration policy setting determines the number of minutes that a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. Set it to a value greater than 0 and less than 100000. threshold: 3, // threshold policy setting determines the number of failed sign-in attempts that will cause a user account to be locked. Set it to an integer value greater than 0 and less than 1000. }, // optional settings to enforce password policies passwordPolicy: { // Two optional settings to enforce strong passwords. Either one or both can be specified. // If both are specified, both checks must pass to accept the password // 1. a RegExp object or a regex string representing the pattern to enforce validatorPattern: /^(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[0-9])(?=.{8,})/, // enforce password with at least 8 char with at least 1 lower case, 1 upper case and 1 digit // 2. a callback function to be invoked to validate the password validatorCallback: (password) => { return validatePassword(password) }, doNotAllowUsername: true, // optional setting to disallow username in passwords maxPasswordAge: 90, // optional setting in days for password expiry. Login fails if user does not reset the password within this period after signup/last reset. maxPasswordHistory: 5, // optional setting to prevent reuse of previous n passwords. Maximum value that can be specified is 20. Not specifying it or specifying 0 will not enforce history. //optional setting to set a validity duration for password reset links (in seconds) resetTokenValidityDuration: 2460*60, // expire after 24 hours } }); ``` You can also use other email adapters contributed by the community such as: - parse-server-postmark-adapter - parse-server-sendgrid-adapter - parse-server-mandrill-adapter - parse-server-simple-ses-adapter - parse-server-mailgun-adapter-template - parse-server-sendinblue-adapter - parse-server-mailjet-adapter - simple-parse-smtp-adapter - parse-server-generic-email-adapter Using environment variables to configure Parse Server You may configure the Parse Server using environment variables: bash PORT PARSE_SERVER_APPLICATION_ID PARSE_SERVER_MASTER_KEY PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI PARSE_SERVER_URL PARSE_SERVER_CLOUD The default port is 1337, to use a different port set the PORT environment variable: bash $ PORT=8080 parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY For the full list of configurable environment variables, run parse-server --help. Available Adapters All official adapters are distributed as scoped pacakges on npm (@parse). Some well maintained adapters are also available on the Parse Server Modules organization. You can also find more adapters maintained by the community by searching on npm. Configuring File Adapters Parse Server allows developers to choose from several options when hosting files: GridStoreAdapter, which is backed by MongoDB; S3Adapter, which is backed by Amazon S3; or GCSAdapter, which is backed by Google Cloud Storage GridStoreAdapter is used by default and requires no setup, but if youre interested in using S3 or Google Cloud Storage, additional configuration information is available in the Parse Server guide. Support For implementation related questions or technical support, please refer to the Stack Overflow and Server Fault communities. If you believe youve found an issue with Parse Server, make sure these boxes are checked before reporting an issue: [ ] Youve met the prerequisites. [ ] Youre running the latest version of Parse Server. [ ] Youve searched through existing issues. Chances are that your issue has been reported or resolved before. Want to ride the bleeding edge? It is recommend to use builds deployed npm for many reasons, but if you want to use the latest not-yet-released version of parse-server, you can do so by depending directly on this branch: npm install parse-community/parse-server.git#master Experimenting You can also use your own forks, and work in progress branches by specifying them: npm install github:myUsername/parse-server#my-awesome-feature And dont forget, if you plan to deploy it remotely, you should run npm install with the --save option.
