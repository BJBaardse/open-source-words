Yii 2 is a modern framework designed to be a solid foundation for your PHP application. It is fast, secure and efficient and works right out of the box pre-configured with reasonable defaults. The framework is easy to adjust to meet your needs, because Yii has been designed to be flexible. Installation The minimum required PHP version of Yii is PHP 5.4. It works best with PHP 7. Follow the Definitive Guide in order to get step by step instructions. Documentation A Definitive Guide and a Class Reference cover every detail of the framework. There is a PDF version of the Definitive Guide and a Definitive Guide Mirror which is updated every 15 minutes. For Yii 1.1 users, there is Upgrading from Yii 1.1 to get an idea of what has changed in 2.0. Community Participate in discussions at forums. Community Slack and Chat in IRC.
