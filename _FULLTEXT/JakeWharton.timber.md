This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Androids normal Log class. I copy this class into all the little apps I make. Im tired of doing it. Now its a library. Behavior is added through Tree instances. You can install an instance by calling Timber.plant. Installation of Trees should be done as early as possible. The onCreate of your application is the most logical choice. The DebugTree implementation will automatically figure out from which class its being called and use that class name as its tag. Since the tags vary, it works really well when coupled with a log reader like Pidcat. There are no Tree implementations installed by default because every time you log in production, a puppy dies. Usage Two easy steps: Install any Tree instances you want in the onCreate of your application class. Call Timbers static methods everywhere throughout your app. Check out the sample app in timber-sample/ to see it in action. Lint Timber ships with embedded lint rules to detect problems in your app. TimberArgCount (Error) - Detects an incorrect number of arguments passed to a Timber call for the specified format string. Example.java:35: Error: Wrong argument count, format string Hello %s %s! requires 2 but format call supplies 1 [TimberArgCount] Timber.d("Hello %s %s!", firstName); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TimberArgTypes (Error) - Detects arguments which are of the wrong type for the specified format string. Example.java:35: Error: Wrong argument type for formatting argument #0 in success = %b: conversion is b, received String (argument #2 in method call) [TimberArgTypes] Timber.d("success = %b", taskName); ~~~~~~~~ TimberTagLength (Error) - Detects the use of tags which are longer than Androids maximum length of 23. Example.java:35: Error: The logging tag can be at most 23 characters, was 35 (TagNameThatIsReallyReallyReallyLong) [TimberTagLength] Timber.tag("TagNameThatIsReallyReallyReallyLong").d("Hello %s %s!", firstName, lastName); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ LogNotTimber (Warning) - Detects usages of Androids Log that should be using Timber. Example.java:35: Warning: Using Log instead of Timber [LogNotTimber] Log.d("Greeting", "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!"); ~ StringFormatInTimber (Warning) - Detects String.format used inside of a Timber call. Timber handles string formatting automatically. Example.java:35: Warning: Using String#format inside of Timber [StringFormatInTimber] Timber.d(String.format("Hello, %s %s", firstName, lastName)); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BinaryOperationInTimber (Warning) - Detects string concatenation inside of a Timber call. Timber handles string formatting automatically and should be preferred over manual concatenation. Example.java:35: Warning: Replace String concatenation with Timbers string formatting [BinaryOperationInTimber] Timber.d("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!"); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TimberExceptionLogging (Warning) - Detects the use of null or empty messages, or using the exception message when logging an exception. Example.java:35: Warning: Explicitly logging exception message is redundant [TimberExceptionLogging] Timber.d(e, e.getMessage()); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Download groovy implementation com.jakewharton.timber:timber:4.7.1 Snapshots of the development version are available in Sonatypes snapshots repository.
