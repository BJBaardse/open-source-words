article on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using go language and awgo library karabiner keyboard remapping karabiner is an absolutely amazing app that lets you remap keys at a very low level on macos i have completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that i can program to do what i want for example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it it becomes a hyper key hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes once when pressed alone and once when held down so for example for remapping caps lock we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it it becomes ⌘ ⌃ modifier key so caps lock f becomes ⌘ ⌃ f and so on i take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys for every single key on my keyboard i describe how i use karabiner in detail here keyboard maestro automation tool keyboard maestro is essentially an ide for automation you create macros of actions that you can then easily call from karabiner it has a wonderful community that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve i share all the macros i use with
