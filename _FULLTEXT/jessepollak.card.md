Card - check out the demo A better credit card form in one line of code Card will take any credit card form and make it the best part of the checkout process (without you changing anything). Everything is created with pure CSS, HTML, and Javascript — no images required. Usage (without jQuery) To use, youll need to include the Card JavaScript files into your HTML, no CSS link is necessary as the JavaScript file does this for you. You can find the necessary file at /dist/card.js and include it in your HTML like so. html <!-- at the end of BODY --> <!-- CSS is included via this JavaScript file --> <script src="/path/to/card.js"></script> Once youve included those files, you can initialize Card. ```javascript var card = new Card({ // a selector or DOM element for the form where users will // be entering their information form: form, // required // a selector or DOM element for the container // where you want the card to appear container: .card-wrapper, // required formSelectors: { numberInput: input#number, // optional — default input[name="number"] expiryInput: input#expiry, // optional — default input[name="expiry"] cvcInput: input#cvc, // optional — default input[name="cvc"] nameInput: input#name // optional - defaults input[name="name"] }, width: 200, // optional — default 350px formatting: true, // optional - default true // Strings for translation - optional messages: { validDate: valid\ndate, // optional - default valid\nthru monthYear: mm/yyyy, // optional - default month/year }, // Default placeholders for rendered fields - optional placeholders: { number: •••• •••• •••• ••••, name: Full Name, expiry: ••/••, cvc: ••• }, masks: { cardNumber: • // optional - mask card number }, // if true, will log helpful messages for setting up Card debug: false // optional - default false }); ``` Installing card from bower If youre using bower, you can install card.js with: bower install card --save Installing card from npm If youre using npm, you can install card.js with: npm install --save card var $ = require("jquery"); // The current card.js code does not explictly require jQuery, but instead uses the global, so this line is needed. window.jQuery = $; var card = require("card"); Using multiple inputs for one field Card can be used in forms where you have multiple inputs that render to a single field (i.e. you have a first and last name input). To use Card with this functionality, just pass in a selector that selects the fields in the correct order. For example, ```html CSS is included via this JavaScript file var card = new Card({ form: form, container: .card-wrapper,</p> <pre><code>formSelectors: { nameInput: input[name="first-name"], input[name="last-name"] } </code></pre> <p>}); ``` Rendering with different initial card placeholders Card renders with default placeholders for card name, number, expiry, and cvc. To override these placeholders, you can pass in a placeholders object. ```html CSS is included via this JavaScript file </p> <p>var card = new Card({ form: form, container: .card-wrapper,</p> <pre><code>placeholders: { number: **** **** **** ****, name: Arya Stark, expiry: **/****, cvc: *** } </code></pre> <p>}); ``` Translation To render the card with the strings in a different language, you can pass in a messages object. ```html CSS is included via this JavaScript file </p> <p>var card = new Card({ form: form, container: .card-wrapper,</p> <pre><code>messages: { validDate: expire\ndate, monthYear: mm/yy } </code></pre> <p>}); ``` Using with jQuery To use with jQuery, youll need to include the jquery.card.js file into your HTML. You can find the necessary file at /dist/jquery.card.js and include it in your HTML like so. html <!-- at the end of BODY --> <!-- CSS is included via this JavaScript file --> <script src="/path/to/jquery.card.js"></script> Once youve included those files, you can initialize Card with jQuery. ```javascript $(form).card({ // a selector or DOM element for the container // where you want the card to appear container: .card-wrapper, // required // all of the other options from above }); ``` Using with other javascript libraries Card has wrappers that make it easy to use with other javascript libraries: Angular 1.x angular-card Angular 2+ ngx-card Ember ember-credit-card React react-credit-card card-react react-plastic - static CSS only version.
