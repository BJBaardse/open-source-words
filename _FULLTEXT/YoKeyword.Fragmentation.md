中文版 README.md Fragmentation Fragmentation is a powerful library managing Fragment for Android. It is designed for "Single Activity + Multi-Fragments" and "Multi-FragmentActivities + Multi-Fragments" architecture to simplify development process. Demo The first demo shows the basic usage of the library. The second one shows the way to implement an app which is similar to Instagram. Complicated nested fragments usage demo are also showed. Download APK Feature 1. Develop complicated nested fragment app rapidly 2. Use fragments stack view dialog to debug easily 3. Add launch mode, startForResult etc. to provide similar behavior of Activity 4. Add onBackPressedSupport() method to support back button press monitoring in Fragment 5. Add onSupportVisible(), onLazyInitView() to simplify dev 6. Easily manage Fragment transition animations 7. To simplify the communication between Fragment(EventBusActivityScope module) 8. Support SwipeBack to pop(Fragmentation_SwipeBack module README) How do I use Fragmentation? 1、build.gradle ````gradle // appcompat-v7 is required compile me.yokeyword:fragmentation:1.3.5 // If you dont want to extends SupportActivity/Fragment and would like to customize your own support, just rely on fragmentation-core // compile me.yokeyword:fragmentation-core:1.3.5 // To get SwipeBack feature, rely on both fragmentation & fragmentation-swipeback compile me.yokeyword:fragmentation:1.3.5 // Swipeback is based on fragmentation. Refer to SwipeBackActivity/Fragment for your Customized SupportActivity/Fragment compile me.yokeyword:fragmentation-swipeback:1.3.5 // To simplify the communication between Fragments. compile me.yokeyword:eventbus-activity-scope:1.1.0 // Your EventBuss version compile org.greenrobot:eventbus:{version} ```` 2. Activity extends SupportActivity or implements ISupportActivity：(refer to MySupportActivity) ````java // since v1.0.0, forced extends of SupportActivity is not required, you can use interface + delegate to implement your own SupportActivity public class MainActivity extends SupportActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(...); // Fragmentation is recommended to initialize in the Application Fragmentation.builder() // show stack view. Mode: BUBBLE, SHAKE, NONE .stackViewMode(Fragmentation.BUBBLE) .debug(BuildConfig.DEBUG) ... .install(); if (findFragment(HomeFragment.class) == null) { loadRootFragment(R.id.fl_container, HomeFragment.newInstance()); //load root Fragment } } ```` 3. Fragment extends SupportFragment or implements ISupportFragment：(refer to MySupportFragment)： ````java // since v1.0.0, forced extends of SupportActivity is not required, you can use interface + delegate to implement your own SupportActivity public class HomeFragment extends SupportFragment { private void xxx() { // launch a new Fragment, other methods: start(fragment,SINGTASK)、startForResult、startWithPop etc. start(DetailFragment.newInstance(HomeBean)); // check wiki for other pop, find and animation setting related API } } ```` WIKI , CHANGELOG LICENSE ```` Copyright 2016 YoKey Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
