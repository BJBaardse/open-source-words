The Motivation We need more Data Scientists. ...by 2018 the United States will experience a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists, and 1.5 million managers and analysts capable of reaping actionable insights from the big data deluge. -- McKinsey Report Highlights the Impending Data Scientist Shortage 23 July 2013 There are little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist. -- David Hardtke "How To Hire A Data Scientist" 13 Nov 2012 An Academic Shortfall Classic academic conduits arent providing Data Scientists -- this talent gap will be closed differently. Academic credentials are important but not necessary for high-quality data science. The core aptitudes – curiosity, intellectual agility, statistical fluency, research stamina, scientific rigor, skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are widely distributed throughout the population. Were likely to see more uncredentialed, inexperienced individuals try their hands at data science, bootstrapping their skills on the open-source ecosystem and using the diversity of modeling tools available. Just as data-science platforms and tools are proliferating through the magic of open source, big datas data-scientist pool will as well. And theres yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap: the democratization of data science. While I agree wholeheartedly with Radens statement that “the crème-de-la-crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia, technology vendors, Wall Street, research and government,” I think hes understating the extent to which autodidacts – the self-taught, uncredentialed, data-passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations data science initiatives. -- James Kobielus, Closing the Talent Gap 17 Jan 2013 Ready? The Open Source Data Science Curriculum Start here. Intro to Data Science / UW Videos * Topics: Python NLP on Twitter API, Distributed Computing Paradigm, MapReduce/Hadoop & Pig Script, SQL/NoSQL, Relational Algebra, Experiment design, Statistics, Graphs, Amazon EC2, Visualization. Data Science / Harvard Videos & Course * Topics: Data wrangling, data management, exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition, prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification, communication of results through visualization, stories, and summaries. Data Science with Open Source Tools Book $27 * Topics: Visualizing Data, Estimation, Models from Scaling Arguments, Arguments from Probability Models, What you Really Need to Know about Classical Statistics, Data Mining, Clustering, PCA, Map/Reduce, Predictive Analytics * Example Code in: R, Python, Sage, C, Gnu Scientific Library A Note About Direction This is an introduction geared toward those with at least a minimum understanding of programming, and (perhaps obviously) an interest in the components of Data Science (like statistics and distributed computing). Out of personal preference and need for focus, I geared the original curriculum toward Python tools and resources. R resources can be found here.
