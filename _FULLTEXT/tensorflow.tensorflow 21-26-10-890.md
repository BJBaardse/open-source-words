documentation tensorflow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs the graph nodes represent mathematical operations while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays tensors that flow between them this flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one or more cpus or gpus in a desktop server or mobile device without rewriting code tensorflow also includes tensorboard a data visualization toolkit tensorflow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the google brain team within googles machine intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well keep up to date with release announcements and security updates by subscribing to announce tensorflow org installation see installing tensorflow for instructions on how to install our release binaries or how to build from source people who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries nightly pip packages we are pleased to announce that tensorflow now offers nightly pip packages under the tf nightly and tf nightly gpu project on pypi simply run pip install tf nightly or pip install tf nightly gpu in a clean environment to install the nightly tensorflow build we support cpu and gpu packages on linux mac and windows try your first tensorflow program shell python python import tensorflow as tf hello tf constant hello tensorflow sess tf session sess run hello hello tensorflow a tf constant 10 b tf constant 32 sess run a b 42 sess close learn more examples about how to do specific tasks in tensorflow at the tutorials page of tensorflow org contribution guidelines if you want to contribute to tensorflow be sure to review the contribution guidelines this project adheres to tensorflows code of conduct by participating you are expected to uphold this code we use github issues for tracking requests and bugs so please see tensorflow discuss for general questions and discussion and please direct specific questions to stack overflow the tensorflow project strives to abide by generally accepted best practices in open source software development continuous build status official builds build type status artifacts linux cpu pypi linux gpu pypi linux xla tba tba macos pypi windows cpu pypi windows gpu pypi android demo apk native libs build history community supported builds build type status artifacts ibm s390x tba ibm ppc64le cpu tba ibm ppc64le gpu tba linux cpu with intel® mkl dnn® tba for more information tensorflow website tensorflow white papers tensorflow youtube channel tensorflow model zoo tensorflow mooc on udacity tensorflow course at stanford learn more about the tensorflow community at the community page of tensorflow org for a few ways to participate license apache license 2 0
