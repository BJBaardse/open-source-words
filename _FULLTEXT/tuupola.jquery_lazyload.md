Lazy Load Plugin for jQuery Lazy Load delays loading images. The plugin defers loading of images outside of the viewport until the user scrolls to them. This is the opposite of image preloading. Using Lazy Load on long web pages containing many large images makes the page load faster. The browser will be in ready state after loading visible images. In some cases it can also help to reduce server load. Lazy Load is inspired by YUI ImageLoader Utility by Matt Mlinac. How to Use? Lazy Load depends on jQuery. Include them both at the end of your HTML code: html <script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="jquery.lazyload.js" type="text/javascript"></script> In addition to adding the scripts, you must alter the img HTML code. Put the image URL inside a data-original attribute. Additionally, it is recommended to give Lazy Loaded images a specific class. This way you can easily control which images the plugin is binded to. Note that you should have width and height attributes in your image tag. html <img class="lazy" data-original="img/example.jpg" width="640" height="480"> then in your script include: js $("img.lazy").lazyload(); This causes all images of class lazy to be lazy loaded.
