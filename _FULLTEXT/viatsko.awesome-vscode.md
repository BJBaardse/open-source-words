Lint and IntelliSense In case the awesome nirvana that is linting has not yet been unleashed upon you: lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. Unlike some other editors, VS Code supports IntelliSense, linting, outline out-of-the-box and doesnt require any separate extension to run linter packages. Some linters are already integrated in VS Code, you can find the full list in the official documentation, Languages section. 1C 1C/OScript - rich 1Ð¡:Enterprise 8 (BSL) language support in VSC - add syntax highlighting to .bsl Ð¸ .os files in VSC, add IntelliSense and syntax helper for 1Ð¡ lang C++ C/C++ - Preview C/C++ extension by Microsoft, read official blog post for the details gnu-global-tags - Provide Intellisense for C/C++ with the help of the GNU Global tool.
