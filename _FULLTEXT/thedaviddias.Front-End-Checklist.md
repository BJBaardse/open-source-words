Front-End Checklist The Front-End Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your site / HTML page to production. It is based on Front-End developers years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists. Table of Contents Head HTML Webfonts CSS Images JavaScript Security Performance Accessibility SEO Translations How to use? All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility: means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations. means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO. means that the item cant be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first. Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist: 📖: documentation or article 🛠: online tool / testing tool 📹: media or video content You can contribute to the Front-End Checklist App reading the README_APP file which explain everything about the project. Head Notes: You can find a list of everything that could be found in the <head> of an HTML document.

If you have only a favicon.ico, put it at the root of your site. Normally you wont need to use any markup. However, its still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, PNG format is recommended over .ico format (dimensions: 32x32px). html <!-- Standard favicon --> <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico"> <!-- Recommended favicon format --> <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png"> 🛠 Favicon Generator 🛠 RealFaviconGenerator 📖 Favicon Cheat Sheet 📖 Favicons, Touch Icons, Tile Icons, etc. Which Do You Need? - CSS Tricks 📖 PNG favicons - caniuse [ ] Apple Web App Meta: Apple meta-tags are present. ```html Apple Touch Icon (at least 200x200px) To run web application in full-screen Status Bar Style (see Supported Meta Tags below for available values) Has no effect unless you have the previous meta tag ``` 📖 Configuring Web Applications 📖 Supported Meta Tags [ ] Windows Tiles: Windows tiles are present and linked. html <!-- Microsoft Tiles --> <meta name="msapplication-config" content="browserconfig.xml" /> Minimum required xml markup for the browserconfig.xml file is as follows: xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <browserconfig> <msapplication> <tile> <square70x70logo src="small.png"/> <square150x150logo src="medium.png"/> <wide310x150logo src="wide.png"/> <square310x310logo src="large.png"/> </tile> </msapplication> </browserconfig> 📖 Browser configuration schema reference [ ] Canonical: Use rel="canonical" to avoid duplicate content. html <!-- Helps prevent duplicate content issues --> <link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/2017/09/a-new-article-to-read.html"> 📖 Use canonical URLs - Search Console Help - Google Support 📖 5 common mistakes with rel=canonical - Google Webmaster Blog HTML tags [ ] Language attribute: The lang attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page. html <html lang="en"> [ ] Direction attribute: The direction of lecture is specified on the html tag (It can be used on another HTML tag). html <html dir="rtl"> 📖 dir - HTML - MDN [ ] Alternate language: The language tag of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page. html <link rel="alternate" href="https://es.example.com/" hreflang="es"> [ ] Conditional comments: Conditional comments are present for IE if needed. 📖 About conditional comments (Internet Explorer) - MSDN - Microsoft [ ] RSS feed: If your project is a blog or has articles, an RSS link was provided.

[ ] CSS order: All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the <head>. (Except the case where sometimes JS files are loaded asynchronously on top of your page). Social meta Facebook OG and Twitter Cards are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display. [ ] Facebook Open Graph: All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with a false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended. Notes: Using og:image:width and og:image:height will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it. html <meta property="og:type" content="website"> <meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page.html"> <meta property="og:title" content="Content Title"> <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg"> <meta property="og:description" content="Description Here"> <meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name"> <meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"> <!-- Next tags are optional but recommended --> <meta property="og:image:width" content="1200"> <meta property="og:image:height" content="630"> 📖 A Guide to Sharing for Webmasters 📖 Best Practices - Sharing 🛠 Test your page with the Facebook OG testing [ ] Twitter Card: html <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@site_account"> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@individual_account"> <meta name="twitter:url" content="https://example.com/page.html"> <meta name="twitter:title" content="Content Title"> <meta name="twitter:description" content="Content description less than 200 characters"> <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg"> 📖 Getting started with cards — Twitter Developers 🛠 Test your page with the Twitter card validator ⬆ back to top HTML Best practices [ ] HTML5 Semantic Elements: HTML5 Semantic Elements are used appropriately (header, section, footer, main...). 📖 HTML Reference [ ] Error pages: Error 404 page and 5xx exist. Remember that the 5xx error pages need to have their CSS integrated (no external call on the current server).
