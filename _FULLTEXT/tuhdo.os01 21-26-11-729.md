operating systems from 0 to 1 this book helps you gain the foundational knowledge required to write an operating system from scratch hence the title 0 to 1 after completing this book at the very least you will learn how to write an operating system from scratch by reading hardware datasheets in the real world it works like that you wont be able to consult google for a quick answer a big picture of how each layer of a computer is related to the other from hardware to software write code independently its pointless to copy and paste code real learning happens when you solve problems on your own some examples are given to kick start but most problems are yours to conquer however the solutions are available online for you to examine after giving it a good try linux as a development environment and how to use common tools for low level programming x86 assembly in depth how a program is structured so that an operating system can run how to debug a program running directly on hardware with gdb and qemu linking and loading on bare metal x86 64 with pure c no standard library no runtime overhead download the book the pedagogy of the book you give a poor man a fish and you feed him for a day you teach him to fish and you give him an occupation that will feed him for a lifetime this has been the guiding principle of the book when i was writing it the book does not try to teach you everything but enough to enable you to learn by yourself the book itself at this point is quite complete once you master part 1 and part 2 which consist of 8 chapters you can drop the book and learn by yourself at this point smart readers should be able to continue on their own for example they can continue their journeys on osdev wiki in fact after you study everything in part 1 and part 2 you only meet the minimum requirement by osdev wiki well not quite the book actually goes deeper for the suggested topics or if you consider developing an os for fun is impractical you can continue with a linux specific book such as this free book linux insides or other popular linux kernel books the book tries hard to provide you a strong foundation and thats why part 1 and part 2 were released first the book teaches you core concepts such as x86 assembly elf linking and debugging on bare metal etc but more importantly where such information come from for example instead of just teaching x86 assembly it also teaches how to use reference manuals from intel learning to read the official manuals is important because only the hardware manufacturers themselves understand how their hardware work if you only learn from the secondary resources because it is easier you will never gain a complete understanding of the hardware you are programming for have you ever read a book on assembly and wondered where all the information came from how does the author know everything he says is correct and how one seems to magically know so much about hardware programming this book gives pointers to such questions as an example you should skim through chapter 4 x86 assembly and c to see how it makes use of the intel manual volume 2 and in the process it guides you how to use the official manuals part 3 is planned as a series of specifications that a reader will implement to complete each operating system component it does not contain code aside from a few examples part 3 is just there to shorten the readers time when reading the official manuals by giving hints where to read explaining difficult concepts and how to use the manuals to debug in short the implementation is up to the reader to work on his or her own the chapters are just like university assignments prerequisites know some circuit concepts basic concepts of electricity atoms electrons protons neutrons current flow ohms law however if you know absolutely nothing about electricity you can quickly learn it here http www allaboutcircuits com textbook by reading chapter 1 and chapter 2 c programming in particular variable and function declarations definitions while and for loops pointers and function pointers fundamental algorithms and data structures in c linux basics know how to navigate directory with the command line know how to invoke a command with options know how to pipe output to another program touch typing since we are going to use linux touch typing helps i know typing speed does not relate to problem solving but at least your typing speed should be fast enough not to let it get it the way and degrade the learning experience in general i assume that the reader has basic c programming knowledge and can use an ide to build and run a program status part 1 chapter 1 complete chapter 2 complete chapter 3 almost currently the book relies on the intel manual for fully explaining x86 execution environment chapter 4 complete chapter 5 complete chapter 6 complete part 2 chapter 7 complete chapter 8 complete part 3 chapter 9 incomplete chapter 10 incomplete chapter 11 incomplete chapter 12 incomplete chapter 13 incomplete and future chapters not included yet in the future i hope to expand part 3 to cover more than the first 2 parts but for the time being i will try to finish the above chapters first sample os this repository is the sample os of the book that is intended as a reference material for part 3 it covers 10 chapters of the system programming guide intel manual volume 3 along with a simple keyboard and video driver for input and output however at the moment only the following features are implemented protected mode creating and managing processes with tss task state structure interrupts lapic paging and i o are not yet implemented i will try to implement it as the book progresses contributing if you find any grammatical issues please report it using github issues or if some sentence or paragraph is difficult to understand feel free to open an issue with the following title format page number type descriptive title for example pg 9 grammar incorrect verb usage type can be one of the following typo indicates typing mistake grammar indicates incorrect grammar usage style indicates a style improvement content indicates problems with the content even better you can make a pull request with the provided book source the main content of the book is in the file operating systems from 0 to 1 lyx you can edit the txt file then i will integrate the changes manually it is a workaround for now since lyx can cause a huge diff which makes it impossible to review changes the book is in development so please bear with me if the english irritates you i really appreciate it finally if you like the project and if it is possible please donate to help this project and keep it going got questions if you have any question related to the material or the development of the book feel free to open a github issue
