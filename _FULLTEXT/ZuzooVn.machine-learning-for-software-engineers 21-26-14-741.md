top down learning path machine learning for software engineers inspired by google interview university translations brazilian portuguese 中文版本 how i nam vu plan to become a machine learning engineer what is it this is my multi month study plan for going from mobile developer self taught no cs degree to machine learning engineer my main goal was to find an approach to studying machine learning that is mainly hands on and abstracts most of the math for the beginner this approach is unconventional because its the top down and results first approach designed for software engineers please feel free to make any contributions you feel will make it better table of contents what is it why use it how to use it follow me dont feel you arent smart enough about video resources prerequisite knowledge the daily plan motivation machine learning overview machine learning mastery machine learning is fun inky machine learning machine learning an in depth guide stories and experiences machine learning algorithms beginner books practical books kaggle knowledge competitions video series mooc resources becoming an open source contributor games podcasts communities conferences interview questions my admired companies why use it im following this plan to prepare for my near future job machine learning engineer ive been building native mobile applications android ios blackberry since 2011 i have a software engineering degree not a computer science degree i have an itty bitty amount of basic knowledge about calculus linear algebra discrete mathematics probability statistics from university think about my interest in machine learning can i learn and get a job in machine learning without studying cs master and phd you can but it is far more difficult than when i got into the field drac smith how do i get a job in machine learning as a software programmer who self studies machine learning but never has a chance to use it at work im hiring machine learning experts for my team and your mooc will not get you the job there is better news below in fact many people with a masters in machine learning will not get the job because they and most who have taken moocs do not have a deep understanding that will help me solve my problems ross c taylor what skills are needed for machine learning jobs first you need to have a decent cs math background ml is an advanced topic so most textbooks assume that you have that background second machine learning is a very general topic with many sub specialties requiring unique skills you may want to browse the curriculum of an ms program in machine learning to see the course curriculum and textbook uri probability distributed computing and statistics hydrangea i find myself in times of trouble afaik there are two sides to machine learning practical machine learning this is about querying databases cleaning data writing scripts to transform data and gluing algorithm and libraries together and writing custom code to squeeze reliable answers from data to satisfy difficult and ill defined questions its the mess of reality theoretical machine learning this is about math and abstraction and idealized scenarios and limits and beauty and informing what is possible it is a whole lot neater and cleaner and removed from the mess of reality i think the best way for practice focused methodology is something like practice — learning — practice that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems and solutions practice to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology after practicing with some elementary experiences they can go into the books and study the underlying theory which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly its a long plan its going to take me years if you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time how to use it everything below is an outline and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom im using githubs special markdown flavor including tasks lists to check progress x create a new branch so you can check items like this just put an x in the brackets x more about github flavored markdown follow me im a vietnamese software engineer who is really passionate and wants to work in the usa how much did i work during this plan roughly 4 hours night after a long hard day at work im on the journey twitter nam vu usa as heck dont feel you arent smart enough i get discouraged from books and courses that tell me as soon as i open them that multivariate calculus inferential statistics and linear algebra are prerequisites i still dont know how to get started… what if im not good at mathematics 5 techniques to understand machine learning algorithms without the background in mathematics how do i learn machine learning about video resources some videos are available only by enrolling in a coursera or edx class it is free to do so but sometimes the classes are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months so you have no access im going to be adding more videos from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time i like using university lectures prerequisite knowledge this short section were prerequisites interesting info i wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan what is the difference between data analytics data analysis data mining data science machine learning and big data learning how to learn dont break the chain how to learn on your own the daily plan each subject does not require a whole day to be able to understand it fully and you can do multiple of these in a day each day i take one subject from the list below read it cover to cover take notes do the exercises and write an implementation in python or r motivation dream machine learning overview a visual introduction to machine learning a gentle guide to machine learning introduction to machine learning for developers
