Jest üÉè Delightful JavaScript Testing üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Developer Ready: Complete and ready to set-up JavaScript testing solution. Works out of the box for any React project. üèÉüèΩ Instant Feedback: Fast interactive watch mode runs only test files related to changed files and is optimized to give signal quickly. üì∏ Snapshot Testing: Capture snapshots of React trees or other serializable values to simplify testing and to analyze how state changes over time. Getting Started generated_getting_started_start Install Jest using yarn: bash yarn add --dev jest Or via npm: bash npm install --save-dev jest The minimum supported Node version is v6.0.0 by default. If you need to support Node 4, refer to the Compatibility issues section. Lets get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a sum.js file: javascript function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } module.exports = sum; Then, create a file named sum.test.js. This will contain our actual test: ```javascript const sum = require(./sum); test(adds 1 + 2 to equal 3, () => { expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3); }); ``` Add the following section to your package.json: json { "scripts": { "test": "jest" } } Finally, run yarn test and Jest will print this message: bash PASS ./sum.test.js ‚úì adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms) You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest! This test used expect and toBe to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see Using Matchers. Running from command line You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if its globally available in your PATH, e.g. by yarn global add jest) with variety of useful options. Heres how to run Jest on files matching my-test, using config.json as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run: bash jest my-test --notify --config=config.json If youd like to learn more about running jest through the command line, take a look at the Jest CLI Options page. Additional Configuration Using Babel Babel is automatically handled by Jest using babel-jest. You dont need install anything extra for using Babel. Note: If you are using a babel version 7 then you need to install babel-core@^7.0.0-0 and @babel/core with the following command: bash yarn add --dev babel-core@^7.0.0-0 @babel/core Dont forget to add a .babelrc file in your projects root folder. For example, if you are using ES6 and React.js with the babel-preset-env and babel-preset-react presets: json { "presets": ["env", "react"] } You are now set up to use all ES6 features and React specific syntax. Note: If you are using a more complicated Babel configuration, using Babels env option, keep in mind that Jest will automatically define NODE_ENV as test. It will not use development section like Babel does by default when no NODE_ENV is set. Note: If youve turned off transpilation of ES modules with the option { "modules": false }, you have to make sure to turn this on in your test environment. json { "presets": [["env", {"modules": false}], "react"], "env": { "test": { "presets": [["env"], "react"] } } } Note: babel-jest is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the transform configuration option: json // package.json { "jest": { "transform": {} } } Using webpack Jest can be used in projects that use webpack to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the webpack guide to get started. Using TypeScript To use TypeScript in your tests you can use ts-jest. generated_getting_started_end Documentation Learn more about using Jest on the official site!
