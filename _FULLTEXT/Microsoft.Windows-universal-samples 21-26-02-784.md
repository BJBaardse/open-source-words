samplefwlink http go microsoft com fwlink p linkid 619979 universal windows platform uwp app samples this repo contains the samples that demonstrate the api usage patterns for the universal windows platform uwp in the windows software development kit sdk for windows 10 these code samples were created with the universal windows platform templates available in visual studio and are designed to run on desktop mobile and future devices that support the universal windows platform note if you are unfamiliar with git and github you can download the entire collection as a zip file but be sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies for more info on working with the zip file the samples collection and github see get the uwp samples from github for more samples see the samples portal on the windows dev center universal windows platform development these samples require visual studio 2017 update 4 or higher and the windows software development kit sdk version 17134 for windows 10 get a free copy of visual studio 2017 community edition with support for building universal windows platform apps additionally to stay on top of the latest updates to windows and the development tools become a windows insider by joining the windows insider program become a windows insider using the samples the easiest way to use these samples without using git is to download the zip file containing the current version using the following link or by clicking the download zip button on the repo page you can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in visual studio 2017 download the samples zip notes before you unzip the archive right click it select properties and then select unblock be sure to unzip the entire archive and not just individual samples the samples all depend on the sharedcontent folder in the archive in visual studio 2017 the platform target defaults to arm so be sure to change that to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non arm device the samples use linked files in visual studio to reduce duplication of common files including sample template files and image assets these common files are stored in the sharedcontent folder at the root of the repository and are referred to in the project files using links reminder if you unzip individual samples they will not build due to references to other portions of the zip file that were not unzipped you must unzip the entire archive if you intend to build the samples for more info about the programming models platforms languages and apis demonstrated in these samples please refer to the guidance tutorials and reference topics provided in the windows 10 documentation available in the windows developer center these samples are provided as is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature apis for windows contributions these samples are direct from the feature teams and we welcome your input on issues and suggestions for new samples at this time we are not accepting new samples from the public but check back here as we evolve our contribution model this project has adopted the microsoft open source code of conduct for more information see the code
