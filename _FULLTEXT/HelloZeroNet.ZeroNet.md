ZeroNet 简体中文 Русский Decentralized websites using Bitcoin crypto and the BitTorrent network - https://zeronet.io Why? We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication. No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is serving it. No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors. Impossible to shut down: Its nowhere because its everywhere. Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is unavailable. Features Real-time updated sites Namecoin .bit domains support Easy to setup: unpack & run Clone websites in one click Password-less BIP32 based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: Allows easier site development and faster page load times Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of IPv4 addresses TLS encrypted connections Automatic uPnP port opening Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support Works with any browser/OS How does it work? After starting zeronet.py you will be able to visit zeronet sites using http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address} (eg. http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D). When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them. Each visited site is also served by you. Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash and a signature generated using the sites private key. If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site, then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers. Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.
