It enables building code analysis tools with the same APIs that are used by Visual Studio. Language Design Discussion We are now taking language feature discussion in other repositories: - https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang for C# specific issues - https://github.com/dotnet/vblang for VB-specific features - https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang for features that affect both languages Discussion about the transition of language design to the new repos is at https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/18002. Download C# and Visual Basic Want to start developing in C# and Visual Basic? Download Visual Studio 2017, which has the latest features built-in. There are also prebuilt Azure VM images available with Visual Studio 2017 already installed. To install the latest release without Visual Studio, run one of the following nuget command lines: nuget install Microsoft.Net.Compilers # Install C# and VB compilers nuget install Microsoft.CodeAnalysis # Install Language APIs and Services Daily NuGet builds of the project are also available in our MyGet feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/roslyn/api/v3/index.json See whats new with the C# and VB compilers.
