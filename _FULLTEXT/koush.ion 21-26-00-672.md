android asynchronous networking and image loading download maven git features asynchronously download images into imageviews or bitmaps animated gifs supported too json via gson strings files java types using gson easy to use fluent api designed for android automatically cancels operations when the calling activity finishes manages invocation back onto the ui thread all operations return a future and can be cancelled http post put text plain application json both jsonobject and pojo application x www form urlencoded multipart form data transparent usage of http features and optimizations spdy and http 2 caching gzip deflate compression connection pooling reuse via http connection keep alive uses the best stablest connection from a server if it has multiple ip addresses cookies view received headers grouping and cancellation of requests download progress callbacks supports file http s and content uris request level logging and profiling support for proxy servers like charles proxy to do request analysis based on nio and androidasync ability to use self signed ssl certificates samples the included documented ion sample project includes some samples that demo common android network operations twitter client sample download json from a server twitter feed populate a listview adapter and fetch more data as you scroll to the end put images from a urls into imageviews twitter profile pictures file download with progress bar sample get json and show images with the image search sample more examples looking for more check out the examples below that demonstrate some other common scenarios you can also take a look at 30 ion unit tests in the ion test get json java ion with context load http example com thing json asjsonobject setcallback new

setmultipartparameter goop noop setmultipartfile archive application zip new file sdcard filename zip asjsonobject setcallback download a file with a progress bar java ion with context load http example com really big file zip have a progressbar get updated automatically with the percent progressbar progressbar and a progressdialog progressdialog progressdialog can also use a custom callback progress new progresscallback override public void onprogress long downloaded long total system out println downloaded total write new file sdcard really big file zip setcallback new futurecallback file override public void oncompleted exception e file file download done do stuff with the file or error setting headers java ion with context load http example com test txt set the header setheader foo bar asstring setcallback load an image into an imageview java this is the long way to do build an imageview request it allows you to set headers etc ion with context load http example com image png withbitmap placeholder r drawable placeholder image error r drawable error image animateload spinanimation animatein fadeinanimation intoimageview imageview but for brevity use the imageview specific builder ion with imageview placeholder r drawable placeholder image error r drawable error image animateload spinanimation animatein fadeinanimation load http example com image png the ion image load api has the following features disk and memory caching bitmaps are held via weak references so memory is managed very efficiently listview adapter recycling support bitmap transformations via the transform transform animate loading and loaded imageview states deepzoom for extremely large images futures all operations return a custom future that allows you to specify a callback that runs on completion java public interface future extends cancellable java util concurrent future set a callback to be invoked when this future completes param callback return public future setcallback futurecallback callback future string ion with context load http example com string txt asstring future json ion with context load http example com json json asjsonobject future file ion with context load http example com file zip write new file sdcard file zip future bitmap ion with context load http example com image png intoimageview imageview cancelling requests futures can be cancelled by calling cancel java bitmap cancel json cancel blocking on requests though you should try to use callbacks for handling requests whenever possible blocking on requests is possible too all futures have a future get method that waits for the result of the request by blocking if necessary java jsonobject json ion with context load http example com thing json asjsonobject get seamlessly use your own java classes with gson java public static class tweet public string id public string text public string photo public void gettweets throws exception ion with context load http example com api tweets as new typetoken setcallback new futurecallback override public void oncompleted exception e list tweets chirp chirp logging wondering why your app is slow ion lets you do both global and request level logging to enable it globally java ion getdefault getcontext configure setlogging mylogs log debug or to enable it on just a single request java ion with context load http example com thing json setlogging mylogs log debug asjsonobject log entries will look like this d mylogs 23153 0 ms http example com thing json executing request d mylogs 23153 106 ms http example com thing json connecting socket d mylogs 23153 2985 ms http example com thing json response is not cacheable d mylogs 23153 3003 ms http example com thing json connection successful request groups by default ion automatically places all requests into a group with all the other requests created by that activity or service using the cancelall activity call all requests still pending can be easily cancelled java future json1 ion with activity http example com test json asjsonobject future json2 ion with activity http example com test2 json asjsonobject later in activity onstop override protected void onstop ion getdefault activity cancelall activity super onstop ion also lets you tag your requests into groups to allow for easy cancellation of requests in that group later java object jsongroup new object object imagegroup new object future json1 ion with activity load http example com test json tag in a custom group group jsongroup asjsonobject future json2 ion with activity load http example com test2 json use the same custom group as the other json request group jsongroup asjsonobject future image1 ion with activity load http example com test png for this image request use a different group for images group imagegroup intoimageview imageview1 future image2 ion with activity load http example com test2 png same imagegroup as before group imagegroup intoimageview imageview2 later to cancel only image downloads ion getdefault activity cancelall imagegroup proxy servers like charles proxy proxy server settings can be enabled all ion requests or on a per request basis java proxy all requests ion getdefault context configure proxy mycomputer 8888 or to proxy specific requests ion with context load http example com proxied html proxy mycomputer 8888 getstring using charles proxy on your desktop computer in conjunction with request proxying will prove invaluable for debugging viewing received headers ion operations return a responsefuture which grant access to response properties via the response object the response object contains the headers as well as the result java ion with getcontext load http example com test txt asstring withresponse setcallback new futurecallback response string override public void oncompleted exception e response string result print the response code ie 200 system out println result getheaders code print the string that was downloaded system out
