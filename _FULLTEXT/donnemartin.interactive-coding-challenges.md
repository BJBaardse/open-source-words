Notebook Installation IPython Notebook If you already have Python installed and are familiar with installing packages, you can get IPython Notebook with pip: pip install "ipython[notebook]" If you run into an issue about pyzmq, refer to the following Stack Overflow post and run: pip uninstall ipython pip install "ipython[all]" As an alternative, you can also use the provided requirements.txt file: pip install -r requirements.txt For detailed instructions, scripts, and tools to more optimally set up your development environment, check out the dev-setup repo. For more details on notebook installation, follow the directions here. More information on IPython/Jupyter Notebooks can be found here. Nose Tests Install nose using setuptools/distribute: easy_install nose or pip install nose More information on Nose can be found here. Running Challenges Notebooks Challenges are provided in the form of IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and have been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. If you need to install IPython/Jupyter Notebook, see the Notebook Installation section. This README contains links to nbviewer, which hosts static notebooks of the repos contents To interact with or to modify elements within the dynamic notebooks, refer to the instructions below Run the notebook of challenges: $ git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges.git $ cd interactive-coding-challenges $ jupyter notebook This will launch your web browser with the list of challenge categories: Navigate to the Challenge Notebook you wish to solve Run the cells within the challenge notebook (Cell->Run All) This will result in an expected unit test error Solve the challenge and verify it passes the unit test Check out the accompanying Solution Notebook for further discussion To debug your solution with pdb, refer to the following ticket. Note: If your solution is different from those listed in the Solution Notebook, consider submitting a pull request so others can benefit from your work. Review the Contributing Guidelines for details. Future Development Challenges, solutions, and unit tests are presented in the form of IPython/Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks currently contain mostly Python solutions (tested on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x), but can be extended to include 40+ supported languages Repo will be continually updated with new solutions and challenges Contributions are welcome!
