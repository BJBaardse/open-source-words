Raphaël: Cross-browser vector graphics the easy way. Visit the library website for more information: ~~http://raphaeljs.com~~ http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/ Quickstart guide You need to have NPM installed to build the library. git clone https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael.git npm run start npm run build To run tests you need to open dev/test/index.html in your browser, theres no automated way right now. Dependencies eve Distributable All files are UMD compliant. You can use: raphael.min.js (includes eve and its minified) raphael.js (includes eve and its not minified) raphael.no-deps.js (doesnt include eve its not minified) raphael.no-deps.min.js (doesnt include eve its minified) Where to start Check Raphael-boilerplate to see examples of loading. Raphael can be loaded in a script tag or with AMD: js define([ "path/to/raphael" ], function( Raphael ) { console.log( Raphael ); }); Development Versions will be released as we gather and test new PRs. As there are a lot of browsers being supported it might take a while to accept a PR, we will use the feedback from other users too. You can use the raphaelTest.html to try things, you need to start a server in the root dir to start testing things there. Something like running python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the raphael directory and hitting http://localhost:8000/dev/raphaelTest.html with the browser. You should run npm run start before this can work.
