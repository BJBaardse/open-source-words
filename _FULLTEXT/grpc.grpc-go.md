Installation To install this package, you need to install Go and setup your Go workspace on your computer. The simplest way to install the library is to run: $ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc Prerequisites This requires Go 1.6 or later. Go 1.7 will be required soon. Constraints The grpc package should only depend on standard Go packages and a small number of exceptions. If your contribution introduces new dependencies which are NOT in the list, you need a discussion with gRPC-Go authors and consultants.
