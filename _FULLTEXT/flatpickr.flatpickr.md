flatpickr - javascript datetime picker Motivation Almost every large SPA or project involves date and time input. Browsers native implementations of those are inconsistent and limited in functionality. Most other libraries require you to pull in heavy dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.js. I wanted something that was good-looking out of the box, dependency-free, powerful, and extensible. Feature overview: Dependency-free (no bloated bundles) Simple, polished UX Date + time input Range selections Ability to select multiple dates Can be used as just a time picker Display dates in a human-friendly format Easily disable specific dates, date ranges, or any date using arbitrary logic Week numbers 50 locales 8 colorful themes (incl. dark and material) Numerous plugins Libraries available for React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and more flatpickr provides more functionality at a fraction of the size of other libraries. Compatibility IE9 and up, Edge, iOS Safari 6+, Chrome 8+, Firefox 6+ Install & Use Demos and documentation: https://flatpickr.github.io/ See also: React Component ember-flatpickr addon angularJS-flatpickr addon angular2+-flatpickr addon vue-flatpickr component Stimulus.js Controller Supporting flatpickr flatpickr will never change its license, pester users for donations, or engage in other user-hostile behavior. Nevertheless, if you enjoyed working with this library or if its made your life easier, you can buy me a cup of coffee :)
