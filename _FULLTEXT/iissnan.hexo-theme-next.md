Theme configurations using Hexo data files (#328) Currently, it is not smooth to update NexT theme from pulling or downloading new releases. It is quite often running into conflict status when updating NexT theme via git pull, or need to merge configurations manually when upgrading to new releases. At present, NexT encourages users to store some options in sites _config.yml and other options in themes _config.yml. This approach is applicable, but has some drawbacks: 1. Configurations are splited into two pieces 2. Users maybe confuse which place should be for options In order to resolve this issue, NexT will take advantage of Hexo Data files. Because Data files is introduced in Hexo 3, so you need upgrade Hexo to 3.0 (or above) to use this feature. If you prefer Hexo 2.x, you can still use the old approach for configurations. NexT is still compatible with Hexo 2.x. Benefits With this feature, now you can put all your configurations into one place (source/_data/next.yml), you dont need to touch next/_config.yml. If there are any new options in new releases, you just need to copy those options from next/_config.yml, paste into _data/next.yml and set their values to whatever you want. How to use this feature Please ensure you are using Hexo 3 (or above) Create an file named next.yml in sites source/_data directory (create _data directory if it did not exist) Copy NexT theme options both in sites _config.yml and themes _config.yml into next.yml. Use --config source/_data/next.yml parameter to start server, generate or deploy.\ For example: hexo clean --config source/_data/next.yml && hexo g --config source/_data/next.yml.
