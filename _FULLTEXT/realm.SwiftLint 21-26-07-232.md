swiftlint a tool to enforce swift style and conventions loosely based on githubs swift style guide swiftlint hooks into clang and sourcekit to use the ast representation of your source files for more accurate results this project adheres to the contributor covenant code of conduct by participating you are expected to uphold this code please report unacceptable behavior to info realm io language switch 中文 한국어 installation using homebrew brew install swiftlint using cocoapods simply add the following line to your podfile ruby pod swiftlint this will download the swiftlint binaries and dependencies in pods during your next pod install execution and will allow you to invoke it via pods root swiftlint swiftlint in your script build phases this is the recommended way to install a specific version of swiftlint since it supports installing a pinned version rather than simply the latest which is the case with homebrew note that this will add the swiftlint binaries its dependencies binaries and the swift binary library distribution to the pods directory so checking in this directory to scm such as git is discouraged using mint mint run realm swiftlint using a pre built package you can also install swiftlint by downloading swiftlint pkg from the latest github release and running it compiling from source you can also build from source by cloning this project and running git submodule update init recursive make install xcode 9 0 or later usage presentation to get a high level overview of recommended ways to integrate swiftlint into your project we encourage you to watch this presentation or read the transcript xcode integrate swiftlint into an xcode scheme to get warnings and errors displayed in the ide just add a new run script phase with bash if which swiftlint dev null then swiftlint else echo warning swiftlint not installed download from https github com realm swiftlint fi alternatively if youve installed swiftlint via cocoapods the script should look like this bash pods root swiftlint swiftlint format on save xcode plugin to run swiftlint autocorrect on save in xcode install the swiftlintxcode plugin from alcatraz ⚠️this plugin will not work with xcode 8 or later without disabling sip this is not recommended appcode to integrate swiftlint with appcode install this plugin and configure swiftlints installed path in the plugins preferences the autocorrect action is available via ⌥⏎ atom to integrate swiftlint with atom install the linter swiftlint package from apm fastlane you can use the official swiftlint fastlane action to run swiftlint as part of your fastlane process ruby swiftlint mode lint swiftlint mode lint default or autocorrect executable pods swiftlint swiftlint the swiftlint binary path optional important if youve installed it via cocoapods path path to lint specify path to lint optional output file swiftlint result json the path of the output file optional reporter json the custom reporter to use optional config file swiftlint ci yml the path of the configuration file optional files list of files to process optional appdelegate swift path to project model swift ignore exit status true allow fastlane to continue even if swiftlint returns a non zero exit status default false quiet true dont print status logs like linting done linting default false strict true fail on warnings default false command line swiftlint help available commands autocorrect automatically correct warnings and errors help display general or command specific help lint print lint warnings and errors for the swift files in the current directory default command rules display the list of rules and their identifiers version display the current version of swiftlint run swiftlint in the directory containing the swift files to lint directories will be searched recursively to specify a list of files when using lint or autocorrect like the list of files modified by xcode specified by the extrabuildphase xcode plugin or modified files in the working tree based on git ls files m you can do so by passing the option use script input files and setting the following instance variables script input file count and script input file 0 script input file 1 script input file script input file count these are same environment variables set for input files to custom xcode script phases working with multiple swift versions swiftlint hooks into sourcekit so it continues working even as swift evolves this also keeps swiftlint lean as it doesnt need to ship with a full swift compiler it just communicates with the official one you already have installed on your machine you should always run swiftlint with the same toolchain you use to compile your code you may want to override swiftlints default swift toolchain if you have multiple toolchains or xcodes installed heres the order in which swiftlint determines which swift toolchain to use xcode default toolchain override toolchain dir or toolchains xcrun find swift

subdirectory of the value passed in the paths above you may also set the toolchains environment variable to the reverse dns notation that identifies a swift toolchain version shell toolchains com apple dt toolchain swift 2 3 swiftlint autocorrect on linux sourcekit is expected to be located in usr lib libsourcekitdinproc so or specified by the linux sourcekit lib path environment variable swift version support heres a reference of which swiftlint version to use for a given swift version swift version last supported swiftlint release swift 1 x swiftlint 0 1 2 swift 2 x swiftlint 0 18 1 swift 3 x latest swift 4 x latest rules over 75 rules are included in swiftlint and the swift community thats you continues to contribute more over time pull requests are encouraged you can find an updated list of rules and more information about them in rules md you can also check source swiftlintframework rules directory to see their implementation opt in rules opt in rules are disabled by default i e you have to explicitly enable them in your configuration file guidelines on when to mark a rule as opt in a rule that can have many false positives e g empty count a rule that is too slow a rule that is not general consensus or is only useful in some cases e g force unwrapping disable rules in code rules can be disabled with a comment inside a source file with the following format swiftlint disable rule1 rule2 rule3 the rules will be disabled until the end of the file or until the linter sees a matching enable comment swiftlint enable rule1 rule2 rule3 for example swift swiftlint disable colon let nowarning string no warning about colons immediately after variable names swiftlint enable colon let haswarning string warning generated about colons immediately after variable names including the all keyword will disable all rules until the linter sees a matching enable comment swiftlint disable all swiftlint enable all for example swift swiftlint disable all let nowarning string no warning about colons immediately after variable names let i also no warning about short identifier names swiftlint enable all let haswarning string warning generated about colons immediately after variable names let y warning generated about short identifier names its also possible to modify a disable or enable command by appending previous this or next for only applying the command to the previous this current or next line respectively for example swift swiftlint disable next force cast let nowarning nsnumber as int let haswarning nsnumber as int let nowarning2 nsnumber as int swiftlint disable this force cast let nowarning3 nsnumber as int swiftlint disable previous force cast run swiftlint rules to print a list of all available rules and their identifiers configuration configure swiftlint by adding a swiftlint yml file from the directory youll run swiftlint from the following parameters can be configured rule inclusion disabled rules disable rules from the default enabled set opt in rules enable rules not from the default set whitelist rules acts as a whitelist only the rules specified in this list will be enabled can not be specified alongside disabled rules or opt in rules yaml disabled rules rule identifiers to exclude from running colon comma control statement opt in rules some rules are only opt in empty count find all the available rules by running swiftlint rules included paths to include during linting pathis ignored if present source excluded paths to ignore during linting takes precedence overincluded carthage pods source excludedfolder source excludedfile swift configurable rules can be customized from this configuration file binary rules can set their severity level force cast warning implicitly force try severity warning explicitly rules that have both warning and error levels can set just the warning level implicitly line length 110 they can set both implicitly with an array type body length 300 warning 400 error or they can set both explicitly file length warning 500 error 1200 naming rules can set warnings errors for min length and max length additionally they can set excluded names type name min length 4 only warning max length warning and error warning 40 error 50 excluded iphone excluded via string identifier name min length only min length error 4 only error excluded excluded via string array id url globalapikey reporter xcode reporter type xcode json csv checkstyle junit html emoji you can also use environment variables in your configuration file by using some variable in a string defining custom rules you can define custom regex based rules in your configuration file using the following syntax yaml custom rules pirates beat ninjas rule identifier included \ swift regex that defines paths to include during linting optional excluded test\ swift regex that defines paths to exclude during linting optional name pirates beat ninjas rule name optional regex n n inja matching pattern match kinds syntaxkinds to match optional comment identifier message pirates are better than ninjas violation message optional severity error violation severity optional no hiding in strings regex n n inja match kinds string this is what the output would look like you can filter the matches by providing one or more match kinds which will reject matches that include syntax kinds that are not present in this list here are all the possible syntax kinds argument attribute builtin attribute id buildconfig id buildconfig keyword comment comment mark comment url doccomment doccomment field identifier keyword number objectliteral parameter placeholder string string interpolation anchor typeidentifier if using custom rules alongside a whitelist make sure to add custom rules as an item under whitelist rules nested configurations swiftlint supports nesting configuration files for more granular control over the linting process include additional swiftlint yml files where necessary in your directory structure each file will be linted using the configuration file that is in its directory or at the deepest level of its parent directories otherwise the root configuration will be used excluded and included are ignored for nested configurations auto correct swiftlint can automatically correct certain violations files on disk are overwritten with a corrected version please make sure to have backups of these files before running swiftlint autocorrect otherwise important data may be lost standard linting is disabled while correcting because of the high likelihood of violations or their offsets being incorrect after modifying a file while applying corrections license mit licensed about swiftlint is maintained and funded by realm inc the names and logos for realm are trademarks
