Storybook Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components. Intro Storybook runs outside of your app. This allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development speed. You can build quickly without having to worry about application-specific dependencies. Here are some featured examples that you can reference to see how Storybook works: https://storybook.js.org/examples/ Storybook comes with a lot of addons for component design, documentation, testing, interactivity, and so on. Storybooks easy-to-use API makes it easy to configure and extend in various ways. It has even been extended to support React Native development for mobile.
