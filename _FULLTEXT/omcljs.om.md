Om A ClojureScript UI framework and client/server architecture over Facebooks React. Om UIs are out of the box snapshotable and undoable and these operations have no implementation complexity and little overhead. Om borrows ideas liberally from Facebooks Relay and Netflixs Falcor with a dash of inspiration from Datomic pull syntax to avoid the typical incidental complexity that arises from client/server state management.
