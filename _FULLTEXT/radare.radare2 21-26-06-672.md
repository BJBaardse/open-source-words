\ \ \ \ \ \ \ https www radare org pancake jenkins travisci appveyor coverity introduction r2 is a rewrite from scratch of radare in order to provide a set of libraries and tools to work with binary files radare project started as a forensics tool a scriptable commandline hexadecimal editor able to open disk files but later support for analyzing binaries disassembling code debugging programs attaching to remote gdb servers radare2 is portable architectures i386 x86 64 arm mips powerpc sparc risc v sh m68k avr xap system z xcore cr16 hppa arc blackfin z80 h8 300 v810 v850 cris xap pic lm32

solaris haiku firefoxos bindings vala genie python 2 3 nodejs lua go perl guile php newlisp ruby java ocaml dependencies radare2 can be built without any special dependency just use make and get a working toolchain gcc clang tcc optionally you can use libewf for loading encase disk images to build the bindings you need latest valabind g and swig2 install the easiest way to install radare2 from git is by running the following command sys install sh if you want to install radare2 in the home directory without using root privileges and sudo simply run sys user sh building with meson ninja if you dont already have meson and ninja you can install them with your distribution package manager or with r2pm r2pm i meson if you already have them installed you can run this line to compile radare2 python sys meson py prefix usr shared install this method is mostly useful on windows because the initial building with makefile is not suitable if you are lost in any way just type python sys meson py help update to update radare2 system wide you dont need to uninstall or pull just re run sys install sh if you installed radare2 in the home directory just re run sys user sh uninstall in case of a polluted filesystem you can uninstall the current version or remove all previous installations make uninstall make purge package manager radare2 has its own package manager r2pm its packages repository is on github too to start to use it for the first time you need to initialize packages r2pm init refresh the packages database before installing any package r2pm update to install a package use the following command r2pm install package name bindings all language bindings are under the r2 bindings directory you will need to install swig and valabind in order to build the bindings for python lua etc apis are defined in vapi files which are then translated to swig interfaces nodejs ffi or other and then compiled the easiest way to install the python bindings is to run r2pm install lang python2 lang python3 for python3 bindings r2pm install r2api python r2pm install r2pipe py in addition there are r2pipe bindings which are an api interface to interact with the prompt passing commands and receivent the output as a string many commands support json output so its integrated easily with many languages in order to deserialize it into native objects npm install r2pipe nodejs gem install r2pipe ruby pip install r2pipe python opam install radare2 ocaml and also for go rust swift d net java newlisp perl haskell vala ocaml and many more to come regression testsuite running make tests it will fetch the radare2 regressions repository and run all the tests in order to verify that no changes break a functionality we run those tests on every commit and they are also executed with asan and valgrind on different platforms to catch other unwanted features documentation there is no formal documentation of r2 yet not all commands are compatible with radare1 so the best way to learn how to do stuff in r2 is by reading the examples from the web and appending to every command you are interested in commands are small mnemonics of few characters and there is some extra syntax sugar that makes the shell much more pleasant for scripting and interacting with the apis you could also checkout the radare2 book coding style look at contributing md webserver radare2 comes with an embedded webserver that serves a pure html js interface that sends ajax queries to the core and aims to implement an usable ui for phones tablets and desktops r2 c h bin ls to use the webserver on windows you require a cmd instance with administrator rights to start the webserver use command in the project root radare2 exe c h rax2 exe pointers website https www radare org irc irc freenode net
