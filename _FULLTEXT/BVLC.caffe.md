Caffe Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)/The Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors. Check out the project site for all the details like DIY Deep Learning for Vision with Caffe Tutorial Documentation BAIR reference models and the community model zoo Installation instructions and step-by-step examples. Custom distributions Intel Caffe (Optimized for CPU and support for multi-node), in particular Xeon processors (HSW, BDW, SKX, Xeon Phi). OpenCL Caffe e.g. for AMD or Intel devices. Windows Caffe Community Please join the caffe-users group or gitter chat to ask questions and talk about methods and models. Framework development discussions and thorough bug reports are collected on Issues. Happy brewing! License and Citation Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license.
