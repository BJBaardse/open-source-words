Hubot Hubot is a framework to build chat bots, modeled after GitHubs Campfire bot of the same name, hubot. Hes pretty cool. Hes extendable with scripts and can work on many different chat services. This repository provides a library thats distributed by npm that you use for building your own bots. See the documentation for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend. In most cases, youll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you are building your own bot. But if you do, check out CONTRIBUTING.md If youd like to chat with Hubot users and developers, join us on Slack. License See the LICENSE file for license rights and limitations (MIT).
