please note skrollr hasnt been under active development since about september 2014 check out the contributions graphs on https github com prinzhorn skrollr graphs contributors and i dont have any plans for doing major changes to it please consider this before using skrollr in production as problems with new browser versions especially on mobile will most definitely surface to be honest mobile support always sucked because mobile browsers are hard and you shouldnt compromise ux for some fancy ui effects ever skrollr 0 6 30 stand alone parallax scrolling javascript library for mobile android ios etc and desktop in about 12k minified designer friendly no javascript skills needed just plain css and html actually skrollr is much more than just parallax scrolling its a full fledged scrolling animation library in fact you can use it and still have no parallax scrolling at all but i wanted to sound hip and use some buzz words by the way skrollr leverages html5 and css3 resources plugins official skrollr menu hash navigation skrollr ie ie 9 css fixes skrollr stylesheets keyframes inside css files third party skrollr colors mix and match hex rgb and hsl colors skrollr decks fullpage presentation decks in the wild check out the wiki page for websites using skrollr and feel free to add your own website you can also shamelessly add yourself to the list here if you are offering paid skrollr support further resources tutorials etc moved to the wiki documentation first of all look at the examples and read the source this might give you a feeling of how stuff works and you can see how some patterns can be implemented abstract skrollr allows you to animate any css property of any element depending on the horizontal scrollbar position all you need to do is define key frames for each element at certain points in top scroll offset other libraries require you to write javascript in order to define your animations this introduces two main problems animation and element are not at one place in order to find out if any animations are defined for a given element you have to scroll through many sometimes thousands of lines of javascript you have to learn a new syntax which is often very verbose and limited at the same time with skrollr you put the definition of your key frames right where they belong to the element using a syntax you already know plain css if you would rather have the keyframes inside a separate file take a look at skrollr stylesheets if you prefer to use javascript to define your animations make sure to take a look at scrollmagic it depends on both jquery and the greensock animation platform gsap and gives you full control over every detail of your animations lets get serious first of all you want to include the skrollr min js file at the bottom of your document right before the closing body and then call skrollr init or you can place it inside the head if you want to but make sure to call init once the document has been loaded e g jquerys ready event or even window onload html script type text javascript src skrollr min js script script type text javascript var s skrollr init script body if you are using require js to structure your project you can use skrollr as a module as well javascript require skrollr function skrollr var s skrollr init if youre familiar with css you already know the style attribute in order to create an animation you would need several at least two of them thats what skrollr does you use the html5 data attributes to define multiple sets of styles we call each of them keyframe and skrollr interpolates between them lets change the background color of a div starting at 00f when the scrollbar is at the top and ending with f00 when the user scrolled 500 pixels down html div data 0 background color rgb 0 0 255 data 500 background color rgb 255 0 0 wooot div view in browser lessons learned skrollr ensures that you can actually scroll down 500 pixels or more even if theres not enough content you can suppress this by using the forceheight option you cant use 00f or 0000ff you need to use rgb or hsl and explicitly decide which color space you want because they result in different animations hsl is much cooler most of the time dont worry the ie plugin teaches ie 9 to display rgb and hsl correctly now lets do a barrel roll at the same time html div data 0 background color rgb 0 0 255 transform rotate 0deg data 500 background color rgb 255 0 0 transform rotate 360deg wooot div view in browser lessons learned skrollr handles all these nasty css prefixes for you just moz relax and get yourself a cup of webkit coffee now let the rotation bounce like it were a hip hop video html div data 0 background color rgb 0 0 255 transform bounce rotate 0deg data 500 background color rgb 255 0 0 transform bounce rotate 360deg wooot div view in browser lessons learned skrollr allows non linear animations the so called easing functions can be used per property by putting them in square brackets behind the property theres a built in list of easing functions see below in the javascript section and you can use your own functions by using the easings options now you may have noticed that using 500 as a keyframe position is kind of random and the look depends on your browser size lets have the animation end when the top of the element reaches the top of the viewport element leaves the viewport html div data 0 background color rgb 0 0 255 transform bounce rotate 0deg data top background color rgb 255 0 0 transform bounce rotate 360deg wooot div view in browser lessons learned skrollr keyframes can either be absolute or relative thats the end of this short intro the following sections will explain some more things in detail if youre not a fan of data attributes or if youre planning a big website where you want a better and more flexible structure take a look at skrollr stylesheets mobile support starting with version 0 5 0 skrollr officially supports mobile browsers including android and ios furthermore mobile support has been rewritten from scratch for skrollr 0 6 0 the problem with mobile and the solution if youre not interested in the details just scroll down a bit to see what you need to do for mobile support some words on why this is an important milestone and why others failed mobile browsers try to save battery wherever they can thats why mobile browsers delay the execution of javascript while you are scrolling ios in particular does this very aggressively and completely stops javascript in short thats the reason why many scrolling libraries either dont work on mobile devices or they come with their own scrollbar which is a usability nightmare on desktop it was an important requirement while i developed skrollr that i dont force you to scroll the way i want it skrollr on desktop uses a native scrollbar and you can scroll the way you want to keyboard mouse etc you just told me it doesnt work on mobile but why does it the answer is simple when using skrollr on mobile you dont actually scroll when detecting a mobile browser skrollr disables native scrolling and instead listens for touch events and moves the content more specific the skrollr body element using css transforms what you need in order to support mobile browsers starting with skrollr 0 6 0 theres just one thing you need to do include an element on your page with the id skrollr body thats the element we move in order to fake scrolling the only case where you dont need a skrollr body is when using position fixed exclusively in fact the skrollr website doesnt include a skrollr body element if you need both fixed and non fixed i e static elements put the static ones inside the skrollr body element or to put it differently on mobile the skrollr body element is moved using css transforms you cant have position fixed or background attachment fixed inside elements which use css transforms as per css spec http meyerweb com eric thoughts 2011 09 12 un fixing fixed elements with css transforms thats why those elements need to be outside of the skrollr body element the skrollr body element might be configured within the init options amd starting with 0 6 22 theres experimental amd support please note that only skrollr core has amd support so far we will update the plugins in the future js require skrollr function skrollr skrollr init absolute vs relative mode being only able to define key frames in absolute values is simply insufficient for some cases for example if you dont know exactly where an element will be in the document thats why there are two modes for key frames namely absolute and relative mode absolute mode or document mode the key frames are defined as absolute values describing how much the document has been scrolled down the syntax is data offset anchor where offset can be any integer 0 is default and anchor can be either start default or end either offset or anchor can be omitted in some situations here are some examples of key frames and their meaning data 0 data start data 0 start when the scroll top is 0 data 100 data 100 start when the scroll top is 100 data 100 data 100 start when the scroll top is 100 sounds like nonsense but keep in mind that interpolation will be relative to this point data end data 0 end when offset is 0 but counting from the bottom of the document instead of from the top in short when you reach the bottom of the page data 100 end 100px before we reach the bottom data 100 end 100px after we reach the bottom again its up to you whether you need it relative mode or viewport mode instead of defining key frames relative to the document i e absolute we are able to define them depending on the position of any element in relation to the viewport the syntax is data offset viewport anchor element anchor where offset can again be any integer and defaults to 0 both viewport anchor mandatory and element anchor optional can be one of top center or bottom if element anchor is omitted the value of viewport anchor will be taken just like with background position here are some examples of key frames and their meaning data top data 0 top data top top data 0 top top when the elements top is aligned with the top of the viewport data 100 top data 100 top top when the elements top is 100px above the top of the viewport data 100 top data 100 top top when the elements top is 100px below the top of the viewport data top bottom data 0 top bottom when the bottom of the element is at the top of the viewport its just not visible data center center data 0 center center when the element is at the center of the viewport data bottom center data 0 bottom center when the elements center is at the bottom of the viewport thus the upper half of the element is visible by default the keyframes are triggered by the position of the element where the keyframes are described however there are times when the position of a second element should trigger the first elements keyframes the data anchor target attribute can be used in these cases the data anchor target attribute accepts any css selector and the position of the first element on the page matching the selector will be used to trigger keyframes on the element where the attribute is defined data anchor target requires ie 8 or greater examples divdata anchor target foo will have its keyframes tiggered by the position of the foo element any css selector can be used i e data anchor target bar not bacon span a href note if you need to support ie 7 then you may only use ids as anchor targets i e foo the ie plugin maps queryselector to getelementbyid heres an infographic for better understanding of anchors click to open pdf important all those values will be calculated up front and transformed to absolute mode so if either the elements box height changes height padding border or the elements position within the document you probably need to call refresh see documentation in javascript section below window resizing is handled by skrollr percentage offsets all offsets shown above are given in absolute pixel values e g data 300 for 300px from the top or data 13 top bottom for a 13px offset to the top bottom anchor as of skrollr 0 6 13 you can also have offsets as percentages of the viewport by appending a p to the number for example data 75p for when you scrolled down 75 of the viewport or data 10p center to have a 10 offset from the center anchor hash navigation check out the skrollr menu plugin working with constants i was lying to you the syntax for absolute mode is not data offset anchor and for relative mode its not data offset viewport anchor element anchor in both cases offset can be preceded by a constant which can be passed to the init method the name of the constant needs to be preceded with an underscore example js skrollr init constants foobar 1337 html equal to valid characters for a constant are a z0 9 dynamic constants starting with skrollr 0 6 19 the word constants doesnt quite fit anymore but who cares you can now use functions and percentages as constants they are automatically evaluated when the window is resized or if you call refresh js skrollr init constants foo function note you can access the skrollr instance with this for things like this relativetoabsolute return math random 100 trolololol vh 100p css classes skrollr will add a skrollr class to the html element when calling init and will remove a no skrollr class if present additionally it will add a skrollr desktop or skrollr mobile class depending on which it detects this allows fallback css rules to create a good user experience on unsupported devices or when javascript or skrollr are disabled all elements under skrollrs control elements with appropriate data attributes will get the skrollable class in addition we add either the skrollable before skrollable between or skrollable after class depending on whether the current scroll position is before between or after the first last smallest largest keyframe of an element animating attributes starting with skrollr 0 6 24 you can also animate attribute and not just style properties this is especially a big thing because in the svg world many properties are implemented as attributes and not in css animating an attribute couldnt be simplier just prefix the property with an symbol html polygon points 426 720 200 720 200 0 955 0 data 0 points 426 720 200 720 200 0 955 0 data 500 points 380 720 200 720 200 0 1302 0 polygon note as always skrollr doesnt do any magic it doesnt understand what a polygon or points are its only interpolating numbers thats it so make sure you have the same number of numbers in your keyframes 8 in this case filling missing values imagine the following animation html div data 100 left 0 data 200 top 0 data 300 left 50 data 400 top 50 div one could expect left to have a value of 25 at keyframe 200 that is not the case by design skrollr only interpolates values between key frames which are direct neighbors what actually happens is that skrollr internally fills out all holes once from left and then from right so the above is equivalent to html div data 100 left 0 top 0 data 200 left 0 top 0 data 300 left 50 top 0 data 400 left 50 top 50 div preventing interpolation the reason why skrollr is so lightweight and powerful is because it literally interpolates every number it can find if you want to prevent some side effect you can suppress interpolation for a specific value by prepending an exclamation point example html this will get your image url f up because theres no kitten1 4561799 jpg and the like better note the values for both keyframes if they contain a number need to be prefixed if you want to avoid skrollr throwing an exception at you limitations there are some limitations of skrollr you should be aware of all numeric values have to have the same unit even 0 needs a unit its not possible to animate from 5 to 100px skrollr wont complain but results are undefined animations between values which are composed of multiple numeric values like margin 0 0 0 0 are only possible for the same number of values margin 0px 0px 0px 0px to margin 0px 100px 50px 3px is fine but not margin 10px to margin 5px 10px animations between css transforms only work when they use the same functions in same order from rotate 0deg scale 1 to rotate 1000deg scale 5 is fine color animations dont support named values like red or hex values like ff0000 instead you have to use rgb rgba hsl and hsla dont worry theres a skrollr plugin for ie 9 to support hsl without a and to fall rgba back to rgb color animations only work for same color functions hsl to hsl or hsla is fine but not rgb to hsl which makes sense because animating from the same colors in rgb space and in hsl space results in different animations hsl gives you the nice rainbow stuff but feel free to send in a pull request to fix any of them just keep in mind that keeping skrollr as lightweight as possible has high priority javascript on the javascript part theres not much to do you can if you want to so if you only know css and html perfect skrollr init options all there is to do is to call skrollr init options which returns an instance of the singleton skrollr class subsequent calls to init will just return the same skrollr instance again possible options for init are smoothscrolling true smooth scrolling smoothens your animations when you scroll down 50 pixels the animations will transition instead of jumping to the new position the global setting can be overridden per element by setting data smooth scrolling to on or off smoothscrollingduration 200 the number of milliseconds the animations run after the scroll position changed the last time constants an object containing integers as values the keys can contain a z0 9 they do not need a leading underscore example data myconst 200 and skrollr init constants myconst 300 result in data 500 scale 1 by default skrollr uses the largest key frame and makes document height viewport height this high thus the max possible scroll top offset if your animation runs too fast or too slow just adjust the scale value scale only affects keyframes in absolute mode when forceheight is set to false scale is ignored scale affects constants as well scale does only affect key frames in absolute mode e g data 500 but not data top forceheight true true make sure the document is high enough that all key frames fit inside example you use data 1000 but the content only makes the document 500px high skrollr will ensure that you can scroll down the whole 1000px or if you use relative mode e g data top bottom skrollr will make sure the bottom of the element can actually reach the top of the viewport false dont manipulate the document and just keep the natural scrollbar mobilecheck function this option allows you to pass a function to skrollr overwriting the check for mobile devices the function should return true when mobile scrolling should be used and false if not the default looks like this js function return android iphone ipad ipod blackberry i test navigator useragent navigator vendor window opera mobiledeceleration 0 004 the amount of deceleration for momentum scrolling on mobile devices this options tells skrollr how fast or slow you want the scrolling to stop after the user lifted his finger set it to 1 to disable momentum scrolling skrollrbody skrollr body this option allows you to override the default id selector used for supporting mobile browsers it might come in handy when the element in question already has a assigned id or if you would like to define more then one skrollrbody depending on preceding javascript logic edgestrategy set this option specifies how to handle animations when the scroll position is outside the range on the keyframes i e before the first or after the last keyframe one of three options are possible set default when before after the first last keyframe apply the styles of the first last keyframe to the element ease same as set but the values will be transformed using the given easing function reset when before after the first last keyframe apply the styles which the element had before skrollr did anything this means resetting the class attribute as well as removing all styles which have been applied to the style property this means the element wont have any skrollable css classes example given the following element with two keyframes html div data 1000 left 0 top 0 data 2000 left 50 top 100 style left 100 class section div and the following easing function which always returns 0 5 i know its pointless but its just an example a real world example would be an easing function that represents a curve and starts somewhere between 0 and 1 but not at 1 js function p return 0 5 and imagine the scrollbar is at 237 which is below the first keyframe which is at 1000 set will result in div style left 0 top 0 class section skrollable skrollable before div which is plain data 1000 ease will result in div style left 25 top 50 class section skrollable skrollable before div which is 0 5 data 1000 reset will result in div style left 100 class section div which is what the element originally had note how top is missing beforerender a listener function that gets called each time right before we render everything the function will be passed an object with the following properties js curtop 10 the current scroll top offset lasttop 0 the top value of last time maxtop 100 the max value you can scroll to curtop maxtop will give you the current progress direction down either up or down returning false will prevent rendering render a listener function that gets called right after we finished rendering everything the function will be passed with the same parameters as beforerender example js skrollr init render function data log the current scroll position console log data curtop keyframe experimental in order to receive keyframe events from an element add the data emit events attribute to the element the keyframe function will be called with three arguments the element that passed the keyframe the name of the keyframe camel cased see example the direction the user is scrolling example html div data 500 data top bottom data offset center data emit events some content js skrollr init keyframe function element name direction name will be one of data500 datatopbottom data offsetcenter note this is experimental expect the api to change originally i wanted to emit the events right on the element so you could do this js wouldnt this be nice document queryselector foo addeventlistener skrollr datatopbottom up function foo just passed the data top bottom keyframe while scrolling up false but ie easing an object defining new easing functions or overwriting existing ones easing functions get just one argument which is a value between 0 and 1 the percentage of how much of the animation is done the function should return a value between 0 and 1 as well but for some easings a value less than 0 or greater than 1 is just fine an easing function basically transforms the timeline for an animation when the animation should be 50 done you can transform it to be 90 done or whatever your function does example js skrollr init easing this easing will sure drive you crazy wtf math random inverted function p return 1 p you can now use the easing functions like any other skrollr ships with some built in functions linear the default doesnt need to be specified quadratic to the power of two so 50 looks like 25 cubic to the power of three so 50 looks like 12 5 begin end they always return 0 or 1 respectively no animation swing slow at the beginning and accelerates at the end so 25 14 6 50 50 75 85 3 sqrt square root starts fast slows down at the end outcubic bounce bounces like a ball see https www desmos com calculator tbr20s8vd2 for a graphical representation custom easing use this

skrollr which exposes a public api refresh elements reparses all given elements you can pass a single element or an array like element array nodelist or jquery object useful when elements in relative mode change and need to be updated data attributes are manipulated dynamically new elements are added to the dom and should be controlled by skrollr when no elements are given all elements in the document will be parsed again in fact when calling skrollr init skrollr uses refresh without parameters internally time consuming operations should not be called on every rendering relativetoabsolute element viewportanchor elementanchor returns an integer which represents the absolute scroll position which correlates to the relative anchor element must be a dom element viewportanchor and elementanchor must be one of top center or bottom example js var offset s relativetoabsolute document getelementbyid foo top bottom offset contains the scroll position at which foos bottom is at the top of the viewport if you now use setscrolltop offset or animateto offset foos bottom will be perfectly aligned with the top of the viewport yay getscrolltop returns the current scroll offset in pixels normalizes different browser quirks and handles mobile scrolling getmaxscrolltop returns the number of pixels that can be scrolled down in total if forceheight is true thats usually the largest keyframe otherwise its the height of the document minus the viewport height setscrolltop top force false sets the top offset using window scrollto 0 top on desktop or updating the internal state in case of mobile scrolling when force is set to true skrollr will jump to the new position without any kind of transition by default the global smoothscrolling setting applies ismobile returns if skrollr runs in mobile mode see also mobilecheck option animateto top options animates the scroll position from current position to top possible options are duration how long the animation should run in milliseconds the default is 1000 or one second easing the name of an easing function the same functions can be used as for property animations default is linear done a function to be called after the animation finished when you pass a top value which is the same as the current then the function will be called immediately the function gets a boolean argument interrupted which indicates if the animation was interrupted by stopanimateto or finished to the end stopanimateto stops the animation and calls the done callback passing true as interrupted arguments isanimatingto returns if an animation caused by animateto is running on name fn set a listener function for one of the events described in the options section beforerender render keyframe only one listener can be attached at a given time this method overwrites the current listener if any off name removes the listener for the given event destroy destroys skrollr all class and style attributes will be set to the values they had before changelog see history md
