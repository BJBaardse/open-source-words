Integrating with GPMDP from External Applications There are two methods you can use to integrate with GPMDP from an external application. 1. JSON Interface 2. Web Socket Interface Both are documented in the Docs folder. For one time read access you should probably use the JSON interface. For an application that requires continuous updates as to the state of GPMDP or needs to control GPMDP you should use the Web Socket interface. Issues If you have any bugs / issues please check the FAQ first before raising an issue Credits Logo designed by @JayToe Development To get started just pull the repo and run the following bash npm install npm run build npm start To build the installers / release packages you need to run, you can only build a platforms installer from that platform. ```bash Windows npm run make:win Mac OS X npm run make:darwin Ubuntu (Requires the dpkg package) npm run make:deb Fedora (Requires the rpm package) npm run make:rpm ``` All releases will be signing with my Code Signing Certificates (Authenticode on Windows and Codesign on OS X) Please see the development FAQ for additional requirements for building.
