Event-driven, non-blocking I/O with PHP. ReactPHP is a low-level library for event-driven programming in PHP. At its core is an event loop, on top of which it provides low-level utilities, such as: Streams abstraction, async DNS resolver, network client/server, HTTP client/server and interaction with processes. Third-party libraries can use these components to create async network clients/servers and more. ReactPHP is production ready and battle-tested with millions of installations from all kinds of projects around the world. Its event-driven architecture makes it a perfect fit for efficient network servers and clients handling hundreds or thousands of concurrent connections, long-running applications and many other forms of cooperative multitasking with non-blocking I/O operations. What makes ReactPHP special is its vivid ecosystem with hundreds of third-party libraries allowing you to integrate with many existing systems, such as common network services, database systems and other third-party APIs. Production ready and battle-tested. Rock-solid with stable long-term support (LTS) releases. Requires no extensions and runs on any platform - no excuses! Takes advantage of optional extensions to get better performance when available. Highly recommends latest version of PHP 7+ for best performance and support. Supports legacy PHP 5.3+ and HHVM for maximum compatibility. Well designed and reusable components. Decoupled parts so they can be replaced by alternate implementations. Carefully tested (unit & functional). Promotes standard PSRs where possible for maximum interoperability. Aims to be technology neutral, so you can use your preferred application stack. Small core team of professionals supported by large network of outside contributors. ReactPHP is non-blocking by default. Use workers for blocking I/O. The event loop is based on the reactor pattern (hence the name) and strongly inspired by libraries such as EventMachine (Ruby), Twisted (Python) and Node.js (V8).

Schmidt Bring High Performance Into Your PHP App (with ReactPHP). marcjschmidt.de Talks Christian L√ºck Pushing the limits with ReactPHP Jeremy Mikola Async PHP With React Igor Wiedler Event-driven PHP Getting started ReactPHP consists of individual components. This means that instead of installing something like a "ReactPHP framework", you actually pick only the components that you need. The recommended way to install these components is through Composer. New to Composer? For example, this may look something like this: bash $ composer require react/event-loop react/http For more details, check out ReactPHPs homepage for quickstart examples and usage details. See also the combined changelog for all ReactPHP components for details about version upgrades. Support Do you have a question and need help with ReactPHP? Dont worry, were here to help! As a first step, check the elaborate documentation that comes with each component (see links to individual documentation for each component above). If you find your question is not answered within the documentation, theres a fair chance that it may be relevant to more people. Please do not hesitate to file your question as an issue in the relevant component so others can also participate. Check out #reactphp on irc.freenode.net. You can use the Webchat if you dont already use an IRC client. Many of us are available in this channel, so many questions get answered in a few minutes to some hours. We also use this channel to announce all new releases and ongoing development efforts, so consider setting up an IRC client and idling in this channel for a little longer. Also follow @reactphp on Twitter for updates. We use this mostly for noteworthy, bigger updates and to keep the community updated about ongoing development efforts. You can always use the #reactphp hashtag if you have anything to share! Were a very open project and we prefer public communication whenever possible, so that more people can participate and help getting the best solutions available. At the same time, we realize that some things are better addressed in private. Whether you just want to say thank you, want to report a security issue or want to help sponsor a certain feature development, you can reach out to the core team in private by sending an email to support@reactphp.org. Please keep in mind that were a small team of volunteers and do our best to support anybody reaching out. Do you want to support ReactPHP? Awesome! Lets start with letting the the world know why you think ReactPHP is awesome and try to help others getting on board! Send a tweet, write a blog post, give a talk at your local user group or conference or even write a book. There are many ways you can help. You can always reach out to us in private and help others in our support channels. Thank you! Tests To run the test suite, you first need to clone this repo and then install all dependencies through Composer: bash $ composer install To run the test suite, go to the project root and run: bash $ php vendor/bin/phpunit The test suite also contains a number of functional integration tests that rely on a stable internet connection. Due to the vast number of integration tests, these are skipped by default on Travis CI. If you also do not want to run these, they can simply be skipped like this: bash $ php vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group internet License MIT, see LICENSE.
