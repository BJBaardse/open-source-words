Our class had these design goals: Intuitive syntax. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the examples below and youll know what I mean. Trivial integration. Our whole code consists of a single header file json.hpp. Thats it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings. Serious testing. Our class is heavily unit-tested and covers 100% of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with Valgrind and the Clang Sanitizers that there are no memory leaks. Google OSS-Fuzz additionally runs fuzz tests agains all parsers 24/7, effectively executing billions of tests so far. To maintain high quality, the project is following the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) best practices. Other aspects were not so important to us: Memory efficiency. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: std::string for strings, int64_t, uint64_t or double for numbers, std::map for objects, std::vector for arrays, and bool for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class basic_json to your needs. Speed. There are certainly faster JSON libraries out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding JSON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a std::vector or std::map, you are already set. See the contribution guidelines for more information. Integration json.hpp is the single required file in single_include/nlohmann or released here. You need to add ```cpp include // for convenience using json = nlohmann::json; ``` to the files you want to process JSON and set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., -std=c++11 for GCC and Clang). You can further use file include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp for forward-declarations. The installation of json_fwd.hpp (as part of cmakes install step), can be achieved by setting -DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON. Package Managers :beer: If you are using OS X and Homebrew, just type brew tap nlohmann/json and brew install nlohmann_json and youre set. If you want the bleeding edge rather than the latest release, use brew install nlohmann_json --HEAD. If you are using the Meson Build System, then you can wrap this repository as a subproject. If you are using Conan to manage your dependencies, merely add jsonformoderncpp/x.y.z@vthiery/stable to your conanfile.pys requires, where x.y.z is the release version you want to use. Please file issues here if you experience problems with the packages. If you are using hunter on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the nlohmann_json package. Please see the hunter project for any issues regarding the packaging. If you are using Buckaroo, you can install this librarys module with buckaroo install nlohmann/json. Please file issues here. If you are using vcpkg on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the nlohmann-json package. Please see the vcpkg project for any issues regarding the packaging. If you are using cget, you can install the latest development version with cget install nlohmann/json. A specific version can be installed with cget install nlohmann/json@v3.1.0. Also, the multiple header version can be installed by adding the -DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON flag (i.e., cget install nlohmann/json -DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON). Examples Beside the examples below, you may want to check the documentation where each function contains a separate code example (e.g., check out emplace()). All example files can be compiled and executed on their own (e.g., file emplace.cpp). JSON as first-class data type Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class. Assume you want to create the JSON object json { "pi": 3.141, "happy": true, "name": "Niels", "nothing": null, "answer": { "everything": 42 }, "list": [1, 0, 2], "object": { "currency": "USD", "value": 42.99 } } With this library, you could write: ```cpp // create an empty structure (null) json j; // add a number that is stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object) j["pi"] = 3.141; // add a Boolean that is stored as bool j["happy"] = true; // add a string that is stored as std::string j["name"] = "Niels"; // add another null object by passing nullptr j["nothing"] = nullptr; // add an object inside the object j["answer"]["everything"] = 42; // add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list) j["list"] = { 1, 0, 2 }; // add another object (using an initializer list of pairs) j["object"] = { {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} }; // instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above) json j2 = { {"pi", 3.141}, {"happy", true}, {"name", "Niels"}, {"nothing", nullptr}, {"answer", { {"everything", 42} }}, {"list", {1, 0, 2}}, {"object", { {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} }} }; ``` Note that in all these cases, you never need to "tell" the compiler which JSON value type you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions json::array and json::object will help: ```cpp // a way to express the empty array [] json empty_array_explicit = json::array(); // ways to express the empty object {} json empty_object_implicit = json({}); json empty_object_explicit = json::object(); // a way to express an array of key/value pairs [["currency", "USD"], ["value", 42.99]] json array_not_object = json::array({ {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} }); ``` Serialization / Deserialization To/from strings You can create a JSON value (deserialization) by appending _json to a string literal: ```cpp // create object from string literal json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"_json; // or even nicer with a raw string literal auto j2 = R"( { "happy": true, "pi": 3.141 } )"_json; ``` Note that without appending the _json suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as JSON string value. That is, json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }" would just store the string "{ "happy": true, "pi": 3.141 }" rather than parsing the actual object. The above example can also be expressed explicitly using json::parse(): cpp // parse explicitly auto j3 = json::parse("{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"); You can also get a string representation of a JSON value (serialize): ```cpp // explicit conversion to string std::string s = j.dump(); // {\"happy\":true,\"pi\":3.141} // serialization with pretty printing // pass in the amount of spaces to indent std::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl; // { // "happy": true, // "pi": 3.141 // } ``` Note the difference between serialization and assignment: ```cpp // store a string in a JSON value json j_string = "this is a string"; // retrieve the string value (implicit JSON to std::string conversion) std::string cpp_string = j_string; // retrieve the string value (explicit JSON to std::string conversion) auto cpp_string2 = j_string.get(); // retrieve the serialized value (explicit JSON serialization) std::string serialized_string = j_string.dump(); // output of original string std::cout << cpp_string << " == " << cpp_string2 << " == " << j_string.get() << \n; // output of serialized value std::cout << j_string << " == " << serialized_string << std::endl; ``` .dump() always returns the serialized value, and .get<std::string>() returns the originally stored string value. To/from streams (e.g. files, string streams) You can also use streams to serialize and deserialize: ```cpp // deserialize from standard input json j; std::cin >> j; // serialize to standard output std::cout << j; // the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl; ``` These operators work for any subclasses of std::istream or std::ostream. Here is the same example with files: ```cpp // read a JSON file std::ifstream i("file.json"); json j; i >> j; // write prettified JSON to another file std::ofstream o("pretty.json"); o << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl; ``` Please note that setting the exception bit for failbit is inappropriate for this use case. It will result in program termination due to the noexcept specifier in use. Read from iterator range You can also parse JSON from an iterator range; that is, from any container accessible by iterators whose content is stored as contiguous byte sequence, for instance a std::vector<std::uint8_t>: cpp std::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {t, r, u, e}; json j = json::parse(v.begin(), v.end()); You may leave the iterators for the range [begin, end): cpp std::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {t, r, u, e}; json j = json::parse(v); STL-like access We designed the JSON class to behave just like an STL container. In fact, it satisfies the ReversibleContainer requirement. ```cpp // create an array using push_back json j; j.push_back("foo"); j.push_back(1); j.push_back(true); // also use emplace_back j.emplace_back(1.78); // iterate the array for (json::iterator it = j.begin(); it != j.end(); ++it) { std::cout << *it << \n; } // range-based for for (auto& element : j) { std::cout << element << \n; } // getter/setter const std::string tmp = j[0]; j[1] = 42; bool foo = j.at(2); // comparison j == "[\"foo\", 1, true]"_json; // true // other stuff j.size(); // 3 entries j.empty(); // false j.type(); // json::value_t::array j.clear(); // the array is empty again // convenience type checkers j.is_null(); j.is_boolean(); j.is_number(); j.is_object(); j.is_array(); j.is_string(); // create an object json o; o["foo"] = 23; o["bar"] = false; o["baz"] = 3.141; // also use emplace o.emplace("weather", "sunny"); // special iterator member functions for objects for (json::iterator it = o.begin(); it != o.end(); ++it) { std::cout << it.key() << " : " << it.value() << "\n"; } // find an entry if (o.find("foo") != o.end()) { // there is an entry with key "foo" } // or simpler using count() int foo_present = o.count("foo"); // 1 int fob_present = o.count("fob"); // 0 // delete an entry o.erase("foo"); ``` Conversion from STL containers Any sequence container (std::array, std::vector, std::deque, std::forward_list, std::list) whose values can be used to construct JSON values (e.g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again STL containers described in this section) can be used to create a JSON array. The same holds for similar associative containers (std::set, std::multiset, std::unordered_set, std::unordered_multiset), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends on how the elements are ordered in the respective STL container. ```cpp std::vector c_vector {1, 2, 3, 4}; json j_vec(c_vector); // [1, 2, 3, 4] std::deque c_deque {1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6}; json j_deque(c_deque); // [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6] std::list c_list {true, true, false, true}; json j_list(c_list); // [true, true, false, true] std::forward_list c_flist {12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543}; json j_flist(c_flist); // [12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543] std::array c_array {{1, 2, 3, 4}}; json j_array(c_array); // [1, 2, 3, 4] std::set c_set {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"}; json j_set(c_set); // only one entry for "one" is used // ["four", "one", "three", "two"] std::unordered_set c_uset {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"}; json j_uset(c_uset); // only one entry for "one" is used // maybe ["two", "three", "four", "one"] std::multiset c_mset {"one", "two", "one", "four"}; json j_mset(c_mset); // both entries for "one" are used // maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"] std::unordered_multiset c_umset {"one", "two", "one", "four"}; json j_umset(c_umset); // both entries for "one" are used // maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"] ``` Likewise, any associative key-value containers (std::map, std::multimap, std::unordered_map, std::unordered_multimap) whose keys can construct an std::string and whose values can be used to construct JSON values (see examples above) can be used to create a JSON object. Note that in case of multimaps only one key is used in the JSON object and the value depends on the internal order of the STL container. ```cpp std::map c_map { {"one", 1}, {"two", 2}, {"three", 3} }; json j_map(c_map); // {"one": 1, "three": 3, "two": 2 } std::unordered_map c_umap { {"one", 1.2}, {"two", 2.3}, {"three", 3.4} }; json j_umap(c_umap); // {"one": 1.2, "two": 2.3, "three": 3.4} std::multimap c_mmap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} }; json j_mmap(c_mmap); // only one entry for key "three" is used // maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true} std::unordered_multimap c_ummap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} }; json j_ummap(c_ummap); // only one entry for key "three" is used // maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true} ``` JSON Pointer and JSON Patch The library supports JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) as alternative means to address structured values. On top of this, JSON Patch (RFC 6902) allows to describe differences between two JSON values - effectively allowing patch and diff operations known from Unix. ```cpp // a JSON value json j_original = R"({ "baz": ["one", "two", "three"], "foo": "bar" })"_json; // access members with a JSON pointer (RFC 6901) j_original["/baz/1"_json_pointer]; // "two" // a JSON patch (RFC 6902) json j_patch = R"([ { "op": "replace", "path": "/baz", "value": "boo" }, { "op": "add", "path": "/hello", "value": ["world"] }, { "op": "remove", "path": "/foo"} ])"_json; // apply the patch json j_result = j_original.patch(j_patch); // { // "baz": "boo", // "hello": ["world"] // } // calculate a JSON patch from two JSON values json::diff(j_result, j_original); // [ // { "op":" replace", "path": "/baz", "value": ["one", "two", "three"] }, // { "op": "remove","path": "/hello" }, // { "op": "add", "path": "/foo", "value": "bar" } // ] ``` JSON Merge Patch The library supports JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) as a patch format. Instead of using JSON Pointer (see above) to specify values to be manipulated, it describes the changes using a syntax that closely mimics the document being modified. ```cpp // a JSON value json j_document = R"({ "a": "b", "c": { "d": "e", "f": "g" } })"_json; // a patch json j_patch = R"({ "a":"z", "c": { "f": null } })"_json; // apply the patch j_original.merge_patch(j_patch); // { // "a": "z", // "c": { // "d": "e" // } // } ``` Implicit conversions The type of the JSON object is determined automatically by the expression to store. Likewise, the stored value is implicitly converted. ```cpp // strings std::string s1 = "Hello, world!"; json js = s1; std::string s2 = js; // Booleans bool b1 = true; json jb = b1; bool b2 = jb; // numbers int i = 42; json jn = i; double f = jn; // etc. ``` You can also explicitly ask for the value: ```cpp std::string vs = js.get(); bool vb = jb.get(); int vi = jn.get(); // etc. ``` Arbitrary types conversions Every type can be serialized in JSON, not just STL containers and scalar types. Usually, you would do something along those lines: ```cpp namespace ns { // a simple struct to model a person struct person { std::string name; std::string address; int age; }; } ns::person p = {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60}; // convert to JSON: copy each value into the JSON object json j; j["name"] = p.name; j["address"] = p.address; j["age"] = p.age; // ... // convert from JSON: copy each value from the JSON object ns::person p { j["name"].get(), j["address"].get(), j["age"].get() }; ``` It works, but thats quite a lot of boilerplate... Fortunately, theres a better way: ```cpp // create a person ns::person p {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60}; // conversion: person -> json json j = p; std::cout << j << std::endl; // {"address":"744 Evergreen Terrace","age":60,"name":"Ned Flanders"} // conversion: json -> person ns::person p2 = j; // thats it assert(p == p2); ``` Basic usage To make this work with one of your types, you only need to provide two functions: ```cpp using nlohmann::json; namespace ns { void to_json(json& j, const person& p) { j = json{{"name", p.name}, {"address", p.address}, {"age", p.age}}; } void from_json(const json& j, person& p) { p.name = j.at("name").get<std::string>(); p.address = j.at("address").get<std::string>(); p.age = j.at("age").get<int>(); } } // namespace ns ``` Thats all! When calling the json constructor with your type, your custom to_json method will be automatically called. Likewise, when calling get<your_type>(), the from_json method will be called. Some important things: Those methods MUST be in your types namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate them (in this example, they are in namespace ns, where person is defined). When using get<your_type>(), your_type MUST be DefaultConstructible. (There is a way to bypass this requirement described later.) In function from_json, use function at() to access the object values rather than operator[]. In case a key does not exist, at throws an exception that you can handle, whereas operator[] exhibits undefined behavior. In case your type contains several operator= definitions, code like your_variable = your_json; may not compile. You need to write your_variable = your_json.get<decltype your_variable>(); instead. You do not need to add serializers or deserializers for STL types like std::vector: the library already implements these. Be careful with the definition order of the from_json/to_json functions: If a type B has a member of type A, you MUST define to_json(A) before to_json(B). Look at issue 561 for more details. How do I convert third-party types? This requires a bit more advanced technique. But first, lets see how this conversion mechanism works: The library uses JSON Serializers to convert types to json. The default serializer for nlohmann::json is nlohmann::adl_serializer (ADL means Argument-Dependent Lookup). It is implemented like this (simplified): ```cpp template struct adl_serializer { static void to_json(json& j, const T& value) { // calls the "to_json" method in Ts namespace } static void from_json(const json& j, T& value) { // same thing, but with the "from_json" method } }; ``` This serializer works fine when you have control over the types namespace. However, what about boost::optional or std::filesystem::path (C++17)? Hijacking the boost namespace is pretty bad, and its illegal to add something other than template specializations to std... To solve this, you need to add a specialization of adl_serializer to the nlohmann namespace, heres an example: ```cpp // partial specialization (full specialization works too) namespace nlohmann { template struct adl_serializer> { static void to_json(json& j, const boost::optional& opt) { if (opt == boost::none) { j = nullptr; } else { j = *opt; // this will call adl_serializer::to_json which will // find the free function to_json in Ts namespace! } } static void from_json(const json& j, boost::optional<T>& opt) { if (j.is_null()) { opt = boost::none; } else { opt = j.get<T>(); // same as above, but with // adl_serializer<T>::from_json } } }; } ``` How can I use get() for non-default constructible/non-copyable types? There is a way, if your type is MoveConstructible. You will need to specialize the adl_serializer as well, but with a special from_json overload: ```cpp struct move_only_type { move_only_type() = delete; move_only_type(int ii): i(ii) {} move_only_type(const move_only_type&) = delete; move_only_type(move_only_type&&) = default; int i; }; namespace nlohmann { template <> struct adl_serializer { // note: the return type is no longer void, and the method only takes // one argument static move_only_type from_json(const json& j) { return {j.get()}; } // Heres the catch! You must provide a to_json method! Otherwise you // will not be able to convert move_only_type to json, since you fully // specialized adl_serializer on that type static void to_json(json& j, move_only_type t) { j = t.i; } }; } ``` Can I write my own serializer? (Advanced use) Yes. You might want to take a look at unit-udt.cpp in the test suite, to see a few examples. If you write your own serializer, youll need to do a few things: use a different basic_json alias than nlohmann::json (the last template parameter of basic_json is the JSONSerializer) use your basic_json alias (or a template parameter) in all your to_json/from_json methods use nlohmann::to_json and nlohmann::from_json when you need ADL Here is an example, without simplifications, that only accepts types with a size <= 32, and uses ADL. ```cpp // You should use void as a second template argument // if you dont need compile-time checks on T template::type> struct less_than_32_serializer { template static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, T value) { // we want to use ADL, and call the correct to_json overload using nlohmann::to_json; // this method is called by adl_serializer, // this is where the magic happens to_json(j, value); } template <typename BasicJsonType> static void from_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) { // same thing here using nlohmann::from_json; from_json(j, value); } }; ``` Be very careful when reimplementing your serializer, you can stack overflow if you dont pay attention: ```cpp template struct bad_serializer { template static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, const T& value) { // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer::to_json(j, value); // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops! j = value; } template <typename BasicJsonType> static void to_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) { // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::from_json(j, value); // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops! value = j.template get<T>(); // oops! } }; ``` Binary formats (CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON) Though JSON is a ubiquitous data format, it is not a very compact format suitable for data exchange, for instance over a network. Hence, the library supports CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), MessagePack, and UBJSON (Universal Binary JSON Specification) to efficiently encode JSON values to byte vectors and to decode such vectors. ```cpp // create a JSON value json j = R"({"compact": true, "schema": 0})"_json; // serialize to CBOR std::vector v_cbor = json::to_cbor(j); // 0xA2, 0x67, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xF5, 0x66, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00 // roundtrip json j_from_cbor = json::from_cbor(v_cbor); // serialize to MessagePack std::vector v_msgpack = json::to_msgpack(j); // 0x82, 0xA7, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xC3, 0xA6, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00 // roundtrip json j_from_msgpack = json::from_msgpack(v_msgpack); // serialize to UBJSON std::vector v_ubjson = json::to_ubjson(j); // 0x7B, 0x69, 0x07, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x54, 0x69, 0x06, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x69, 0x00, 0x7D // roundtrip json j_from_ubjson = json::from_ubjson(v_ubjson); ``` Supported compilers Though its 2018 already, the support for C++11 is still a bit sparse. Currently, the following compilers are known to work: GCC 4.9 - 7.2 (and possibly later) Clang 3.4 - 5.0 (and possibly later) Intel C++ Compiler 17.0.2 (and possibly later) Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 / Build Tools 14.0.25123.0 (and possibly later) Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 / Build Tools 15.5.180.51428 (and possibly later) I would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions. Please note: GCC 4.8 does not work because of two bugs (55817 and 57824) in the C++11 support. Note there is a pull request to fix some of the issues. Android defaults to using very old compilers and C++ libraries. To fix this, add the following to your Application.mk. This will switch to the LLVM C++ library, the Clang compiler, and enable C++11 and other features disabled by default. APP_STL := c++_shared NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := clang3.6 APP_CPPFLAGS += -frtti -fexceptions The code compiles successfully with Android NDK, Revision 9 - 11 (and possibly later) and CrystaXs Android NDK version 10. For GCC running on MinGW or Android SDK, the error to_string is not a member of std (or similarly, for strtod) may occur. Note this is not an issue with the code, but rather with the compiler itself.

I am not sure what they are using the library for, but I am happy that it runs on so many devices. Notes The code contains numerous debug assertions which can be switched off by defining the preprocessor macro NDEBUG, see the documentation of assert. In particular, note operator[] implements unchecked access for const objects: If the given key is not present, the behavior is undefined (think of a dereferenced null pointer) and yields an assertion failure if assertions are switched on. If you are not sure whether an element in an object exists, use checked access with the at() function. As the exact type of a number is not defined in the JSON specification, this library tries to choose the best fitting C++ number type automatically. As a result, the type double may be used to store numbers which may yield floating-point exceptions in certain rare situations if floating-point exceptions have been unmasked in the calling code. These exceptions are not caused by the library and need to be fixed in the calling code, such as by re-masking the exceptions prior to calling library functions. The library supports Unicode input as follows: Only UTF-8 encoded input is supported which is the default encoding for JSON according to RFC 7159. Other encodings such as Latin-1, UTF-16, or UTF-32 are not supported and will yield parse or serialization errors. Unicode noncharacters will not be replaced by the library. Invalid surrogates (e.g., incomplete pairs such as \uDEAD) will yield parse errors. The strings stored in the library are UTF-8 encoded. When using the default string type (std::string), note that its length/size functions return the number of stored bytes rather than the number of characters or glyphs. The code can be compiled without C++ runtime type identification features; that is, you can use the -fno-rtti compiler flag. Exceptions are used widely within the library. They can, however, be switched off with either using the compiler flag -fno-exceptions or by defining the symbol JSON_NOEXCEPTION. In this case, exceptions are replaced by an abort() call. By default, the library does not preserve the insertion order of object elements. This is standards-compliant, as the JSON standard defines objects as "an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs". If you do want to preserve the insertion order, you can specialize the object type with containers like tsl::ordered_map (integration) or nlohmann::fifo_map (integration). Execute unit tests To compile and run the tests, you need to execute sh $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake .. $ cmake --build . $ ctest --output-on-failure For more information, have a look at the file .travis.yml.
