AngularStrap AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of Bootstrap 3.0+ into your AngularJS 1.2+ app. With no external dependency except the Bootstrap CSS Styles, AngularStrap is lighter and faster than ever as it does leverage the power of ngAnimate from AngularJS 1.2+! AngularStrap is tested against the latest patch release of the 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 branches. If you dont want to use ngAnimate, you will have to include a tiny ngAnimate mock. Looking for maintainers! Were currently looking for aspiring maintainers to tackle issues and pull requests! I (mgcrea) have not worked on any Angular.js v1 codebase for more than a year now.

You will need to have bower installed globally into your node environment. bash $ npm install -g bower AngularStrap is tested with karma against the latest stable release of AngularJS. AngularStrap uses gulp@4.0, you must use the local gulp instance with $(npm bin)/gulp for it to work (or use an alias). ```bash $ npm install $ bower install $ cd docs $ bower install $ cd .. $ npm test or $ npm run test:watch ``` You can build the latest version using gulp. bash $ $(npm bin)/gulp build You can quickly hack around (the docs) with: bash $ $(npm bin)/gulp serve You can browse to http://localhost:9090/dev.html to work on a specific directive. Contributing Please submit all pull requests the against master branch. If your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you should include relevant unit tests.
