typicode comments id 1 body some comment postid 1 profile name typicode start json server bash json server watch db json now if you go to http localhost 3000 posts 1 youll get json id 1 title json server author typicode also when doing requests its good to know that if you make post put patch or delete requests changes will be automatically and safely saved to db json using lowdb your request body json should be object enclosed just like the get output for example name foobar id values are not mutable any id value in the body of your put or patch request will be ignored only a value set in a post request will be respected but only if not already taken a post put or patch request should include a content type application json header to use the json in the request body otherwise it will result in a 200 ok but without changes being made to the data install bash npm install g json server routes based on the previous db json file here are all the default routes you can also add other routes using routes plural routes get posts get posts 1 post posts put posts 1 patch posts 1 delete posts 1 singular routes get profile post profile put profile patch profile filter use to access deep properties get posts title json server author typicode get posts id 1 id 2 get comments author name typicode paginate use page and optionally limit to paginate returned data in the link header youll get first prev next and last links get posts page 7 get posts page 7 limit 20 10 items are returned by default sort add sort and order ascending order by default get posts sort views order asc get posts 1 comments sort votes order asc for multiple fields use the following format get posts sort user views order desc asc slice add start and end or limit an x total count header is included in the response get posts start 20 end 30 get posts 1 comments start 20 end 30 get posts 1 comments start 20 limit 10 works exactly as array slice i e start is inclusive and end exclusive operators add gte or lte for getting a range get posts views gte 10 views lte 20 add ne to exclude a value get posts id ne 1 add like to filter regexp supported get posts title like server full text search add q get posts q internet relationships to include children resources add embed get posts embed comments get posts 1 embed comments to include parent resource add expand get comments expand post get comments 1 expand post to get or create nested resources by default one level add custom routes for more get posts 1 comments post posts 1 comments database get db homepage returns default index file or serves public directory get extras static file server you can use json server to serve your html js and css simply create a public directory or use static to set a different static files directory bash mkdir public echo hello world public index html json server db json bash json server db json static some other dir alternative port you can start json server on other ports with the port flag bash json server watch db json port 3004 access from anywhere you can access your fake api from anywhere using cors and jsonp remote schema you can load remote schemas bash json server http example com file json json server http jsonplaceholder typicode com db generate random data using js instead of a json file you can create data programmatically javascript index js module exports const data users create 1000 users for let i 0 i 1000 i data users push id i name user i return data bash json server index js tip use modules like faker casual chance or json schema faker https theres many way to set up ssl in development one simple way though is to use hotel add custom routes create a routes json file pay attention to start every route with json api 1 resource id show resource id posts category posts category category articles\ id id posts id start json server with routes option bash json server db json routes routes json now you can access resources using additional routes sh api posts → posts api posts 1 → posts 1 posts 1 show → posts 1 posts javascript → posts category javascript articles id 1 → posts 1 add middlewares you can add your middlewares from the cli using middlewares option js hello js module exports req res next res header x hello world next bash json server db json middlewares hello js json server db json middlewares first js second js cli usage json server options options config c path to config file default json server json port p set port default 3000 host h set host default localhost watch w watch file s boolean routes r path to routes file middlewares m paths to middleware files array static s set static files directory read only ro allow only get requests boolean no cors nc disable cross origin resource sharing boolean no gzip ng disable gzip content encoding boolean snapshots s set snapshots directory default delay d add delay to responses ms id i set database id property e g id default id foreignkeysuffix fks set foreign key suffix e g id as in post id default id quiet q suppress log messages from output boolean help h show help boolean version v show version number boolean examples json server db json json server file js json server http example com db json https github com typicode json server you can also set options in a json server json configuration file json port 3000 module if you need to add authentication validation or any behavior you can use the project as a module in combination with other express middlewares simple example sh npm install json server save dev js server js const jsonserver require json server const server jsonserver create const router jsonserver router db json const middlewares jsonserver defaults server use middlewares server use router server listen 3000 console log json server is running sh node server js the path you provide to the jsonserver router function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process if you run the above code from another directory its better to use an absolute path js const path require path const router jsonserver router path join dirname db json for an in memory database simply pass an object to jsonserver router please note also that jsonserver router can be used in existing express projects custom routes example lets say you want a route that echoes query parameters and another one that set a timestamp on every resource created js const jsonserver require json server const server jsonserver create const router jsonserver router db json const middlewares jsonserver defaults set default middlewares logger static cors and no cache server use middlewares add custom routes before json server router server get echo req res res jsonp req query to handle post put and patch you need to use a body parser you can use the one used by json server server use jsonserver bodyparser server use req res next if req method post req body createdat date now continue to json server router next use default router server use router server listen 3000 console log json server is running access control example js const jsonserver require json server const server jsonserver create const router jsonserver router db json const middlewares jsonserver defaults server use middlewares server use req res next if isauthorized req add your authorization logic here next continue to json server router else res sendstatus 401 server use router server listen 3000 console log json server is running custom output example to modify responses overwrite router render method javascript in this example returned resources will be wrapped in a body property router render req res res jsonp body res locals data you can set your own status code for the response javascript in this example we simulate a server side error response router render req res res status 500 jsonp error error message here rewriter example to add rewrite rules use jsonserver rewriter javascript add this before server use router server use jsonserver rewriter api 1 blog resource id show resource id mounting json server on another endpoint example alternatively you can also mount the router on api javascript server use api router api jsonserver create returns an express server jsonserver defaults options returns middlewares used by json server options static path to static files logger enable logger middleware default true bodyparser enable body parser middleware default true nocors disable cors default false readonly accept only get requests default false jsonserver router path object returns json server router
