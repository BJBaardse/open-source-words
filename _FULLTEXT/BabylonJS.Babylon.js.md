To install use npm install babylonjs --save This will allow you to import BabylonJS entirely using: import * as BABYLON from babylonjs; or individual classes using: import { Scene, Engine } from babylonjs; If using TypeScript, dont forget to add babylonjs to types in tsconfig.json: .... "types": [ "babylonjs", "anotherAwesomeDependency" ], .... To add a module install the respected package. A list of extra packages and their installation instructions can be found on babylonjs user at npm. Usage See Getting Started javascript // Get the canvas DOM element var canvas = document.getElementById(renderCanvas); // Load the 3D engine var engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {preserveDrawingBuffer: true, stencil: true}); // CreateScene function that creates and return the scene var createScene = function(){ // Create a basic BJS Scene object var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine); // Create a FreeCamera, and set its position to {x: 0, y: 5, z: -10} var camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera(camera1, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene); // Target the camera to scene origin camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero()); // Attach the camera to the canvas camera.attachControl(canvas, false); // Create a basic light, aiming 0, 1, 0 - meaning, to the sky var light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight(light1, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene); // Create a built-in "sphere" shape; its constructor takes 6 params: name, segment, diameter, scene, updatable, sideOrientation var sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere(sphere1, 16, 2, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.FRONTSIDE); // Move the sphere upward 1/2 of its height sphere.position.y = 1; // Create a built-in "ground" shape; its constructor takes 6 params : name, width, height, subdivision, scene, updatable var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGround(ground1, 6, 6, 2, scene, false); // Return the created scene return scene; } // call the createScene function var scene = createScene(); // run the render loop engine.runRenderLoop(function(){ scene.render(); }); // the canvas/window resize event handler window.addEventListener(resize, function(){ engine.resize(); }); Preview release Preview version of 3.3 can be found here.
