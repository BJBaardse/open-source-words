Tinker Tinker is a hot-fix solution library for Android, it supports dex, library and resources update without reinstalling apk. Getting started Add tinker-gradle-plugin as a dependency in your main build.gradle in the root of your project: gradle buildscript { dependencies { classpath (com.tencent.tinker:tinker-patch-gradle-plugin:1.9.1) } } Then you need to "apply" the plugin and add dependencies by adding the following lines to your app/build.gradle. gradle dependencies { //optional, help to generate the final application provided(com.tencent.tinker:tinker-android-anno:1.9.1) //tinkers main Android lib compile(com.tencent.tinker:tinker-android-lib:1.9.1) } ... ... apply plugin: com.tencent.tinker.patch If your app has a class that subclasses android.app.Application, then you need to modify that class, and move all its implements to SampleApplicationLike rather than Application: java -public class YourApplication extends Application { +public class SampleApplicationLike extends DefaultApplicationLike { Now you should change your Application class, make it a subclass of TinkerApplication. As you can see from its API, it is an abstract class that does not have a default constructor, so you must define a no-arg constructor: java public class SampleApplication extends TinkerApplication { public SampleApplication() { super( //tinkerFlags, which types is supported //dex only, library only, all support ShareConstants.TINKER_ENABLE_ALL, // This is passed as a string so the shell application does not // have a binary dependency on your ApplicationLifeCycle class. "tinker.sample.android.app.SampleApplicationLike"); } } Use tinker-android-anno to generate your Application is recommended, you just need to add an annotation for your SampleApplicationLike class java @DefaultLifeCycle( application = "tinker.sample.android.app.SampleApplication", //application name to generate flags = ShareConstants.TINKER_ENABLE_ALL) //tinkerFlags above public class SampleApplicationLike extends DefaultApplicationLike How to install tinker? learn more at the sample SampleApplicationLike. For proguard, we have already made the proguard config automatic, and tinker will also generate the multiDex keep proguard file for you. For more tinker configurations, learn more at the sample app/build.gradle. Known Issues There are some issues which Tinker cant dynamic update.
