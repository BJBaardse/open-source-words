Let us know! Middleware Iris has a great collection of handlers[1][2] that you can use side by side with your web apps. However you are not limited to them - you are free to use any third-party middleware that is compatible with the net/http package, _examples/convert-handlers will show you the way. Iris, unlike others, is 100% compatible with the standards and thats why the majority of the big companies that adapt Go to their workflow, like a very famous US Television Network, trust Iris; its up-to-date and it will be always aligned with the std net/http package which is modernized by the Go Authors on each new release of the Go Programming Language.
