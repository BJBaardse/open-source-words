Welcome to Mailpile! Introduction Mailpile (https://www.mailpile.is/) is a modern, fast web-mail client with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of Mailpile is funded by a large community of backers and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI approved Free Software license. Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user interface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to make it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed e-mail. Mailpiles primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology for the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop application (accessed by visiting localhost in the browser) or a remote web-mail on a personal server or VPS. The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMails labels) and the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers. Note: We are currently working towards a 1.0 release candidate. Until it is ready, Mailpile is really only suitable for developers who can help us find and fix the last few bugs. Our beta releases are obsolete and should not be used, in part for security reasons! For more details follow @MailpileTeam on Twitter or read our blog. Trying Mailpile We have live demos up and running on our website. If you are curious about what Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out. Installing Mailpile Note that Mailpile is still in development and is not suitable for production or end-user use. However, developers and early adopters are encouraged to give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and develop new features. Please see our download page or read the Getting Started guide on our wiki. Credits and License Bjarni R. Einarsson (http://bre.klaki.net/) created this! If you think its neat, you should also check out PageKite: https://pagekite.net/. At some point Bjarni, that crafty fellow, convinced Sm√°ri and Brennan to start working on the project as well. The GMail guys get mad props for creating the best webmail service out there. Wishing the Free Software world had something like it is what inspired Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. Edward Snowden also gets mad props for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for journalists and everday folks! Contributors: Bjarni R.

And of course, we couldnt do this without our community of backers.
