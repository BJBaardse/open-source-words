note the latest version of rxjs can be found here the need to go reactive about the reactive extensions batteries included why rxjs dive in resources getting started what about my libraries compatibility contributing license the reactive extensions for javascript rxjs 4 0 is a set of libraries to compose asynchronous and event based programs using observable collections and array extras style composition in javascript the project is actively developed by microsoft in collaboration with a community of open source developers the need to go reactive applications especially on the web have changed over the years from being a simple static page to dhtml with animations to the ajax revolution each time were adding more complexity more data and asynchronous behavior to our applications how do we manage it all how do we scale it by moving towards reactive architectures which are event driven resilient and responsive with the reactive extensions you have all the tools you need to help build these systems about the reactive extensions the reactive extensions for javascript rxjs is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators that many of you already know by array extras in javascript using rxjs developers represent asynchronous data streams with observables query asynchronous data streams using our many operators and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using schedulers simply put rxjs observables operators schedulers whether you are authoring a web based application in javascript or a server side application in node js you have to deal with asynchronous and event based programming although some patterns are emerging such as the promise pattern handling exceptions cancellation and synchronization is difficult and error prone using rxjs you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams that come from diverse sources e g stock quote tweets computer events web service requests etc and subscribe to the event stream using the observer object the observable notifies the subscribed observer instance whenever an event occurs because observable sequences are data streams you can query them using standard query operators implemented by the observable type thus you can filter project aggregate compose and perform time based operations on multiple events easily by using these operators in addition there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries to be written cancellation exceptions and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using the methods on the observable object but the best news of all is that you already know how to program like this take for example the following javascript code where we get some stock data and then manipulate and iterate the results js get stock data somehow const source getasyncstockdata const subscription source filter quote quote price 30 map quote quote price foreach price console log prices higher than 30 price now what if this data were to come as some sort of event for example a stream such as a websocket then we could pretty much write the same query to iterate our data with very little change js get stock data somehow const source getasyncstockdata const subscription source filter quote quote price 30 map quote quote price subscribe price console log prices higher than 30 price err console log something went wrong err message when were done subscription dispose the only difference is that we can handle the errors inline with our subscription and when were no longer interested in receiving the data as it comes streaming in we call dispose on our subscription note the use of subscribe instead of foreach we could also use foreach which is an alias for subscribe but we highly suggest you use subscribe batteries included sure there are a lot of libraries to get started with rxjs confused on where to get started start out with the complete set of operators with rx all js then you can reduce it to the number of operators that you really need and perhaps stick with something as small as rx lite js if youre an implementor of rxjs then you can start out with rx core js this set of libraries include the complete library rx all js main libraries rx js rx aggregates js rx async js rx binding js rx coincidence js rx experimental js rx joinpatterns js rx testing js rx time js rx virtualtime js lite libraries rx lite js rx lite extras js rx lite aggregates js rx lite async js rx lite coincidence js rx lite experimental js rx lite joinpatterns js rx lite testing js rx lite time js rx lite virtualtime js core libraries rx core js rx core binding js rx core testing js why rxjs one question you may ask yourself is why rxjs what about promises promises are good for solving asynchronous operations such as querying a service with an xmlhttprequest where the expected behavior is one value and then completion reactive extensions for javascript unify both the world of promises callbacks as well as evented data such as dom input web workers and web sockets unifying these concepts enables rich composition to give you an idea about rich composition we can create an autocompletion service which takes user input from a text input and then throttles queries to a service to avoid flooding the service with calls for every key stroke first well reference the javascript files including jquery although rxjs has no dependencies on jquery html script src https code jquery com jquery js script script src rx lite js script next well get the user input from an input listening to the keyup event by using the rx observable fromevent method this will either use the event binding from jquery zepto angularjs backbone js and ember js if available and if not falls back to the native event binding this gives you consistent ways of thinking of events depending on your framework so there are no surprises js const input input const results results only get the value from each key up var keyups rx observable fromevent input keyup pluck target value filter text text length 2 now debounce the input for 500ms var debounced keyups debounce 500 ms now get only distinct values so we eliminate the arrows and other control characters var distinct debounced distinctuntilchanged now lets query wikipedia in rxjs we can instantly bind to any promises a implementation through the rx observable frompromise method or directly return it and rxjs will wrap it for you js let searchwikipedia term return ajax url https en wikipedia org w api php datatype jsonp data action opensearch format json search term promise once that is created we can tie together the distinct throttled input and query the service in this case well call flatmaplatest to get the value and ensure were not introducing any out of order sequence calls js const suggestions distinct flatmaplatest searchwikipedia finally we call the subscribe method on our observable sequence to start pulling data js suggestions subscribe data results empty append map data 1 value li text value error results empty append li text error
