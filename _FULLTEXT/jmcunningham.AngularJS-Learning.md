AngularJS-Learning NOTE: As of October 2016, there is a [new repo for collecting links to Angular 2] (https://github.com/jmcunningham/AngularJS2-Learning). I had plans of updating this ng 1 list to focus mostly on Angular 1.5, but Im ready to move my efforts on to ng2. This repo will likely see little activity from me, though I will still accept PRs for anyone who wants to update this for ng 1.5. A bunch of links to blog posts, articles, videos, etc for learning AngularJS. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have some links/resources to add. Also, I try to verify that the articles below have some real content (i.e. arent 2 paragraph blog posts with little information) to ensure Im not listing "fluff" pieces. If you have an idea for a better way to organize these links, please let me know. As I find similar posts in the "General Topics" section, I will break them out into their own categories. I also blog about Angular and JavaScript topics at [my blog] (http://jmcunningham.net/). NOTE: LINKS PRECEDED WITH A ** DISCUSS NEW STUFF IN ANGULAR 1.3. Googles post announcing the release of 1.3.0 is [here] (http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/10/angularjs-130-superluminal-nudge.html). And the [migration guide] (https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration#migrating-from-1-2-to-1-3) from 1.2 to 1.3. NOTE 2: Soon, I plan to remove all links that deal with Angular 1.0 or 1.1. All links will be 1.2 and above.
