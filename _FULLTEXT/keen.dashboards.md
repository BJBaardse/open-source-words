Dashboards by Keen IO Building an analytics dashboard? Dont start from scratch. Grab one of our Bootstrap-based templates and admire your data in minutes. Begin with a layout: Add charts to each chart-stage HTML element: html <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3"> <div class="chart-wrapper"> <div class="chart-title"> Chart Title </div> <div class="chart-stage"> <div id="grid-1-1"> <!-- chart goes here! --> </div> </div> <div class="chart-notes"> Notes about this chart (optional) </div> </div> </div> And voil√†! An attractive, custom analytics dashboard thats ready to be shown to your team or your customers. No hours lost tweaking CSS or testing responsiveness on eight different mobile devices. The Templates These layout templates are composed of a minimal set of Bootstrap v3.2 custom styles. They cover the most common use cases and layout configurations weve encountered so far. Layouts for pre-built, responsive dashboard views Examples for specific domains, data models and popular integrations Integrations These templates can work with any data source or charting library, but theyre particularly streamlined to work with Keen IOs visualization toolkit. To see the Keen integration in action, create a free project and send some data to it. Then add some charts to your dashboard with just a few lines of code. You can also use this pre-populated set of demo data. Usage Ready to use one of these awesome layouts? Heres how to get started. In the sidebar, is a Download Zip link. Click it to download a copy of the code. Check out the various layouts and pick the one that best suits your needs. Find the template in the repository you downloaded at folder/layouts/(name-of-template). Start editing! In the destination folder will exist an .html file. Open it in your favorite text editor. There are three things you need to do to edit your dashboard: Setup: If youre a registered Keen IO user, navigate to your keen project or if you dont have a user at first, you can simply use some demo data that weve prepared for you. You can access those by going to the repository and navigating to demo-data. There, you will see some javascript files with some code in them. We will simply paste those in the .html file. Some copypasta. When you navigate to the bottom of the .html file, you can see that there are a bunch of script tags. Just before the end of the body tag, were going to add in the code from sample.html. Simply copy and paste the code just before you see </body>. Once youve done that we need to hook up the specific items within the template to the code that weve just pasted in to our file. In line 21 of sample.html, you will see a line of code: document.getElementById(chart-01). That means that this query will try to find inside the html file a node with an id of chart-01. In these templates, you will see lines of that resemble something like: html <div class="chart-stage"> <!-- This is where you need to put the id property in! --> <img data-src="holder.js/100%x650/white"> </div> Now were going to change those lines so that it looks like this: html <div class="chart-stage" id="chart-01"> <!-- This is where you need to put the id property in! --> <!-- Get rid of that img tag! --> </div> Youre finished! Congratulations on setting up your first chart! Repeat step three with the rest of the items in the template to complete your dashboard! Contributing Contributions are 11,000,000% welcome!
