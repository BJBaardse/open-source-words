bootstrap for sass bootstrap sass is a sass powered version of bootstrap 3 ready to drop right into your sass powered applications this is bootstrap 3 for bootstrap 4 use the bootstrap ruby gem if you use ruby and the main repo otherwise installation please see the appropriate guide for your environment of choice ruby on rails compass not on rails bower npm node js a ruby on rails bootstrap sass is easy to drop into rails with the asset pipeline in your gemfile you need to add the bootstrap sass gem and ensure that the sass rails gem is present it is added to new rails applications by default ruby gem bootstrap sass 3 3 7 gem sass rails 3 2 bundle install and restart your server to make the files available through the pipeline import bootstrap styles in app assets stylesheets application scss scss bootstrap sprockets must be imported before bootstrap and bootstrap variables import bootstrap sprockets import bootstrap bootstrap sprockets must be imported before bootstrap for the icon fonts to work make sure the file has scss extension or sass for sass syntax if you have just generated a new rails app it may come with a css file instead if this file exists it will be served instead of sass so rename it console mv app assets stylesheets application css app assets stylesheets application scss then remove all the require self and require tree statements from the sass file instead use import to import sass files do not use require in sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the bootstrap mixins or variables bootstrap javascript depends on jquery if youre using rails 5 1 add the jquery rails gem to your gemfile ruby gem jquery rails console bundle install require bootstrap javascripts in app assets javascripts application js js require jquery require bootstrap sprockets bootstrap sprockets and bootstrap should not both be included in application js bootstrap sprockets provides individual bootstrap javascript files alert js or dropdown js for example while bootstrap provides a concatenated file containing all bootstrap javascripts bower with rails when using bootstrap sass bower package instead of the gem in rails configure assets in config application rb ruby bower asset paths root join vendor assets bower components to s tap do bower path config sass load paths bower path config assets paths bower path end precompile bootstrap fonts config assets precompile r bootstrap sass assets fonts bootstrap \w eot svg ttf woff2 minimum sass number precision required by bootstrap sass sass script value number precision 8 sass script value number precision max replace bootstrap import statements in application scss with scss icon font path bootstrap sass assets fonts bootstrap import bootstrap sass assets stylesheets bootstrap sprockets import bootstrap sass assets stylesheets bootstrap replace bootstrap require directive in application js with js require bootstrap sass assets javascripts bootstrap sprockets rails 4 x please make sure sprockets rails is at least v2 1 4 rails 3 2 x bootstrap sass is no longer compatible with rails 3 the latest version of bootstrap sass compatible with rails 3 2 is v3 1 1 0 b compass without rails install the gem console gem install bootstrap sass if you have an existing compass project require bootstrap sass in config rb ruby require bootstrap sass install bootstrap with console bundle exec compass install bootstrap r bootstrap sass if you are creating a new compass project you can generate it with bootstrap sass support console bundle exec compass create my new project r bootstrap sass using bootstrap or alternatively if youre not using a gemfile for your dependencies console compass create my new project r bootstrap sass using bootstrap this will create a new compass project with the following files in it styles sass main project sass file imports bootstrap and variables bootstrap variables sass all of bootstrap variables override them here some bootstrap sass mixins may conflict with the compass ones if this happens change the import order so that compass mixins are loaded later c bower bootstrap sass bower package is compatible with node sass 3 2 0 you can install it with console bower install bootstrap sass sass js and all other assets are located at assets by default bower json main field list only the main bootstrap scss and all the static assets fonts and js this is compatible by default with asset managers such as wiredep node js mincer if you use mincer with node sass import bootstrap like so in application css ejs scss nb css ejs scss scss import mincer asset paths helper integration import bootstrap mincer import bootstrap in application js js require bootstrap sprockets see also this example manifest js for mincer d npm node js console npm install bootstrap sass configuration sass by default all of bootstrap is imported you can also import components explicitly to start with a full list of modules copy bootstrap scss file into your assets as bootstrap custom scss then comment out components you do not want from bootstrap custom in the application sass file replace import bootstrap with scss import bootstrap custom sass number precision bootstrap sass requires minimum sass number precision of 8 default is 5 precision is set for rails and compass automatically when using ruby sass compiler standalone or with the bower version you can set it with ruby sass script value number precision 8 sass script value number precision max sass autoprefixer bootstrap requires the use of autoprefixer autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes to css rules using values from can i use to match upstream bootstraps level of browser compatibility set autoprefixers browsers option to json android 2 3 android 4 chrome 20 firefox 24 explorer 8 ios 6 opera 12 safari 6 javascript assets javascripts bootstrap js contains all of bootstraps javascript concatenated in the correct order javascript with sprockets or mincer if you use sprockets or mincer you can require bootstrap sprockets instead to load the individual modules js load all bootstrap javascript require bootstrap sprockets you can also load individual modules provided you also require any dependencies you can check dependencies in the bootstrap js documentation js require bootstrap scrollspy require bootstrap modal require bootstrap dropdown fonts the fonts are referenced as scss icon font path icon font name eot icon font path defaults to bootstrap if asset path helpers are used and fonts bootstrap otherwise when using bootstrap sass with compass sprockets or mincer you must import the relevant path helpers before bootstrap itself for example scss import bootstrap compass import bootstrap usage sass import bootstrap into a sass file for example application scss to get all of bootstraps styles mixins and variables scss import bootstrap you can also include optional bootstrap theme scss import bootstrap theme the full list of bootstrap variables can be found here you can override these by simply redefining the variable before the import directive e g scss navbar default bg 312312 light orange ff8c00 navbar default color light orange import bootstrap eyeglass bootstrap is available as an eyeglass module after installing bootstrap via npm you can import the bootstrap library via scss import bootstrap sass bootstrap or import only the parts of bootstrap you need scss import bootstrap sass bootstrap variables import bootstrap sass bootstrap mixins import bootstrap sass bootstrap carousel version bootstrap for sass version may differ from the upstream version in the last number known as patch the patch version may be ahead of the corresponding upstream minor this happens when we need to release sass specific changes before v3 3 2 bootstrap for sass version used to reflect the upstream version with an additional number for sass specific changes this was changed due to bower and npm compatibility issues the upstream versions vs the bootstrap for sass versions are upstream sass 3 3 4 same 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 1 x always refer to changelog md when upgrading development and contributing if youd like to help with the development of bootstrap sass itself read this section upstream converter keeping bootstrap sass in sync with upstream changes from bootstrap used to be an error prone and time consuming manual process with bootstrap 3 we have introduced a converter that automates this note if youre just looking to use bootstrap 3 see the installation section above upstream changes to the bootstrap project can now be pulled in using the convert rake task heres an example run that would pull down the master branch from the main twbs bootstrap repo rake convert this will convert the latest less to sass and update to the latest js to convert a specific branch or version pass the branch name or the commit hash as the first task argument rake convert e8a1df5f060bf7e6631554648e0abde150aedbe4 the latest converter script is located here and does the following converts upstream bootstrap less files to its matching scss file copies all upstream javascript into assets javascripts bootstrap a sprockets manifest at assets javascripts bootstrap sprockets js and a concatenation at assets javascripts bootstrap js copies all upstream font files into assets fonts bootstrap sets bootstrap bootstrap sha in version rb to the branch sha this converter fully converts original less to scss conversion is automatic but requires instructions for certain transformations see converter output please submit github
