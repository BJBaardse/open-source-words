isomorphic-fetch Fetch for node and Browserify. Built on top of GitHubs WHATWG Fetch polyfill. Warnings This adds fetch as a global so that its API is consistent between client and server. You must bring your own ES6 Promise compatible polyfill, I suggest es6-promise. For ease-of-maintenance and backward-compatibility reasons, this library will always be a polyfill. As a "safe" alternative, which does not modify the global, consider fetch-ponyfill. Installation NPM sh npm install --save isomorphic-fetch es6-promise Bower sh bower install --save isomorphic-fetch es6-promise Usage ```js require(es6-promise).polyfill(); require(isomorphic-fetch); fetch(//offline-news-api.herokuapp.com/stories) .then(function(response) { if (response.status >= 400) { throw new Error("Bad response from server"); } return response.json(); }) .then(function(stories) { console.log(stories); }); ``` License All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence.
