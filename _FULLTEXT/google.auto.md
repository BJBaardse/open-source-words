Auto A collection of source code generators for Java. Autoâ€½ Java is full of code that is mechanical, repetitive, typically untested and sometimes the source of subtle bugs. Sounds like a job for robots! The Auto subprojects are a collection of code generators that automate those types of tasks. They create the code you would have written, but without the bugs. Save time. Save code. Save sanity. Subprojects AutoFactory - JSR-330-compatible factories AutoService - Provider-configuration files for [ServiceLoader] AutoValue - Immutable value-type code generation for Java 1.6+. Common - Helper utilities for writing annotation processors. License Copyright 2013 Google, Inc.
