Table of content Quickstart Usage What does it do Bullsh*t, what does it really do to my files Supported Storages Supported Applications Can you support application X Why did you do this What platforms are supported Whats up with the weird name Where can I find more information Quickstart If you have Dropbox installed and want to use it to save your config files, thats super easy. On OS X, if you want an easy install, you can install Homebrew and do: ```bash Install Mackup brew install mackup Launch it and back up your files mackup backup ``` If not running OS X, or you dont like Homebrew, you can use pip. Note: The below command will check if a previous version of Mackup is already installed on your system. If this is the case, it will be upgraded to the latest version. ```bash Install Mackup with PIP pip install --upgrade mackup Launch it and back up your files mackup backup ``` Youre all set and constantly backed up from now on. Next, on any new workstation, do: ```bash Install Mackup brew install mackup Launch it and restore your files mackup restore ``` Done! You can find more detailed instructions in INSTALL.md. Usage mackup backup Backup your application settings. mackup restore Restore your application settings on a newly installed workstation. mackup uninstall Copy back any synced config file to its original place. mackup list Display the list of applications supported by Mackup. mackup -h Get some help, obviously... What does it do Back ups your application settings in a safe directory (e.g. Dropbox) Syncs your application settings among all your workstations Restores your configuration on any fresh install in one command line By only tracking pure configuration files, it keeps the crap out of your freshly new installed workstation (no cache, temporary and locally specific files are transfered). Mackup makes setting up the environment easy and simple, saving time for your family, great ideas, and all the cool stuff you like. Bullsh*t, what does it really do to my files Lets take git as an example. Your settings for git are saved in your home folder, in the .gitconfig file. Backup If you have Dropbox, these things happen when you launch mackup backup: cp ~/.gitconfig ~/Dropbox/Mackup/.gitconfig rm ~/.gitconfig ln -s ~/Dropbox/Mackup/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig Now your git config is always backed up and up to date on all your workstations. Restore When you launch mackup restore, heres what its really doing: ln -s ~/Dropbox/Mackup/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig Thats it, you got your git config setup on your new workstation. mackup does the same for any supported application. Uninstall You can revert all your files to their original state. ```bash Just run this mackup uninstall ``` This will remove the symlinks and copy back the files from the Mackup folder in Dropbox to their original places in your home. The Mackup folder and the files in it stay put, so that any other computer also running Mackup is unaffected.

Or a cool file you want to sync? Use a ~/.mackup.cfg to sync a single file (e.g. ~/.gitignore) Create a ~/.mackup directory to sync an application or any file or directory Why did you do this Yesterday, I had a talk with Zach Zaro, complaining about the pain it is to reconfigure our Macbook each time we get a new one or install from scratch. Thats a talk we have already had months ago. I change my workstation every X months. Each time I either lose my apps configurations, or I just waste a bunch of hours getting setup like I was on my old box. I also spend a lot of time reconfiguring the same stuff again on all my workstations (home, work). Boring... Some people tried to solve the problem on the application layer, like Githubs Boxen, but it solves a different problem, from my point of view. I dont spend a lot of time installing or downloading stuff. I spend time configuring it. For years, Ive used a personal shell script that was copying known config files into Subversion, Git or Dropbox, and linked them into my home. But I felt a lot of us had the same problem: Making a more generic tool could help others and I could get help from others to support more apps in the tool. So here comes Mackup, the little tool that will sync all your application configs to Dropbox (or Google Drive, or anything). And its GPL, of course. What platforms are supported OS X GNU/Linux Whats up with the weird name Mackup is just a portmanteau of Mac and Backup. It is simple, short, and easy to remember, and it corresponds with the whole idea of Mackup: the simpler – the better! (And I suck at naming stuff, but who doesnt.)
