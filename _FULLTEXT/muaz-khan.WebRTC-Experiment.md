WebRTC Experiments & Demos It is a repository of uniquely experimented WebRTC demos; written by Muaz Khan! No special requirement! Just WebRTC compatible web-browser (e.g. chrome/firefox/opera on desktop/android) These demos/experiments are mostly client-side; i.e. no server installation needed! You can use all these demos in PHP/Python/Ruby/ASP.NET/etc. since they are only relying on JavaScript and 3rd party services! How to use? Each demo has a unique directory. Simply download that directory, upload in your webserver and use it; and itll work! You dont need to modify any single line to use it. No single installation or modification is needed :) DetectRTC | Is WebRTC Supported In Your Browser? A tiny JavaScript library that can be used to detect WebRTC features e.g. system having speakers, microphone or webcam, screen capturing is supported, number of audio/video devices etc. Live Demo: https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/DetectRTC/ Github (open sourced): https://github.com/muaz-khan/DetectRTC RecordRTC | WebRTC Audio+Video+Screen Recording WebRTC JavaScript library for audio/video as well as screen activity recording.
