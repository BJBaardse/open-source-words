Releases CHANGELOG Gridster is maintained by Ducksboard occasionally but not actively. @dustmoo and @pushmatrix have also write permissions as Gridster maintainers they are. Thank you guys! Forks Mr @dustmoo (maintainer of Gridster) has his own fork of gridster.js with some new interesting features like widget-swapping and static widgets. Can be found here: dustmoo/gridster.js @dustmoo is working in his spare time to merge all these changes into ducksboard/gridster.js If anyone would like to help @dustmoo improve his fork and reconcile it with the main library he would be happy for the help.
