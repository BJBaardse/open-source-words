goquery a little like that j thing only in go goquery brings a syntax and a set of features similar to jquery to the go language it is based on gos net html package and the css selector library cascadia since the net html parser returns nodes and not a full featured dom tree jquerys stateful manipulation functions like height css detach have been left off also because the net html parser requires utf 8 encoding so does goquery it is the callers responsibility to ensure that the source document provides utf 8 encoded html see the wiki for various options to do this syntax wise it is as close as possible to jquery with the same function names when possible and that warm and fuzzy chainable interface jquery being the ultra popular library that it is i felt that writing a similar html manipulating library was better to follow its api than to start anew in the same spirit as gos fmt package even though some of its methods are less than intuitive looking at you index table of contents installation changelog api examples related projects support license installation please note that because of the net html dependency goquery requires go1 1 go get github com puerkitobio goquery optional to run unit tests cd gopath src github com puerkitobio goquery go test optional to run benchmarks warning it runs for a few minutes cd gopath src github com puerkitobio goquery go test bench changelog note that goquerys api is now stable and will not break 2018 06 07 v1 4 1 add newdocumentfromreader examples 2018 03 24 v1 4 0 deprecate newdocument url and newdocumentfromresponse response 2018 01 28 v1 3 0 add toend constant to slice until the end of the selection thanks to davidjwilkins for raising the issue 2018 01 11 v1 2 0 add addback and deprecate andself thanks to davidjwilkins 2017 02 12 v1 1 0 add sethtml and settext thanks to glebtv 2016 12 29 v1 0 2 optimize allocations for selection text thanks to radovskyb 2016 08 28 v1 0 1 optimize performance for large documents 2016 07 27 v1 0 0 tag version 1 0 0 2016 06 15 invalid selector strings internally compile to a matcher implementation that never matches any node instead of a panic so for example doc find returns an empty selection object 2016 02 02 add nodename utility function similar to the doms nodename property it returns the tag name of the first element in a selection and other relevant values of non element nodes see godoc for details add outerhtml utility function similar to the doms outerhtml property named outerhtml in small caps for consistency with the existing html method on the selection 2015 04 20 add attror helper method to return the attributes value or a default value if absent thanks to piotrkowalczuk 2015 02 04 add more manipulation functions prepend thanks again to andrew stone 2014 11 28 add more manipulation functions replacewith wrap and unwrap thanks again to andrew stone 2014 11 07 add manipulation functions thanks to andrew stone and matcher functions that receive compiled cascadia selectors instead of selector strings thus avoiding potential panics thrown by goquery via cascadia mustcompile calls this results in better performance selectors can be compiled once and reused and more idiomatic error handling you can handle cascadias compilation errors instead of recovering from panics which had been bugging me for a long time note that the actual type expected is a matcher interface that cascadia selector implements other matcher implementations could be used 2014 11 06 change import paths of net html to golang org x net html see https groups google com forum topic golang nuts ed8dh3t9yya make sure to update your code to use the new import path too when you call goquery with html nodes v0 3 2 add newdocumentfromreader thanks jweir which allows creating a goquery document from an io reader v0 3 1 add newdocumentfromresponse thanks assassingj which allows creating a goquery document from an http response v0 3 0 add eachwithbreak which allows to break out of an each loop by returning false this function was added instead of changing the existing each to avoid breaking compatibility v0 2 1 make go getable now that go net html is go1 0 compatible thanks to matrixik for pointing this out v0 2 0 add support for negative indices in slice breaking change document root is removed document is now a selection itself a selection of one the root element just like document root was before add jquerys closest method v0 1 1 add benchmarks to use as baseline for refactorings refactor next and prev methods to use the new html packages linked list features next prevsibling firstchild good performance boost 40 in some cases v0 1 0 initial release api goquery exposes two structs document and selection and the matcher interface unlike jquery which is loaded as part of a dom document and thus acts on its containing document goquery doesnt know which html document to act upon so it needs to be told and thats what the document type is for it holds the root document node as the initial selection value to manipulate jquery often has many variants for the same function no argument a selector string argument a jquery object argument a dom element argument instead of exposing the same features in goquery as a single method with variadic empty interface arguments statically typed signatures are used following this naming convention when the jquery equivalent can be called with no argument it has the same name as jquery for the no argument signature e g prev and the version with a selector string argument is called xxxfiltered e g prevfiltered when the jquery equivalent requires one argument the same name as jquery is used for the selector string version e g is the signatures accepting a jquery object as argument are defined in goquery as xxxselection and take a selection object as argument e g filterselection the signatures accepting a dom element as argument in jquery are defined in goquery as xxxnodes and take a variadic argument of type html node e g filternodes the signatures accepting a function as argument in jquery are defined in goquery as xxxfunction and take a function as argument e g filterfunction the goquery methods that can be called with a selector string have a corresponding version that take a matcher interface and are defined as xxxmatcher e g ismatcher utility functions that are not in jquery but are useful in go are implemented as functions that take a selection as parameter to avoid a potential naming clash on the selections methods reserved for jquery equivalent behaviour the complete godoc reference documentation can be found here please note that cascadias selectors do not necessarily match all supported selectors of jquery sizzle see the cascadia project for details invalid selector strings compile to a matcher that fails to match any node behaviour of the various functions that take a selector string as argument follows from that fact e g where is an invalid selector string find returns an empty selection because the selector string doesnt match anything add returns a new selection that holds the same nodes as the original selection because it didnt add any node selector string didnt match anything parentsfiltered returns an empty selection because the selector string doesnt match anything parentsuntil returns all parents of the selection because the selector string didnt match any element to stop before the top element examples see some tips and tricks in the wiki adapted from example test go go
