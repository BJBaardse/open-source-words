the corresponding platform ios option manually if you want to use any of the bundled icons you need to add the icon fonts to your xcode project just follow these steps browse to node modules react native vector icons and drag the folder fonts or just the ones you want to your project in xcode make sure your app is checked under add to targets and that create groups is checked if you add the whole folder edit info plist and add a property called fonts provided by application or uiappfonts if xcode wont autocomplete not using xcode and type in the files you just added it will look something like this note you need to recompile your project after adding new fonts also ensure that they also appear under copy bundle resources in build phases if you want to use the tabbar navigatorios integration or use getimagesource then you need to add rnvectoricons xcodeproj to libraries and add librnvectoricons a to link binary with libraries under build phases more info and screenshots about how to do this is available in the react native documentation option with react native link react native link note some users are having trouble using this method try one of the others if you are too option with cocoapods add the following to your podfile and run pod update pod rnvectoricons path node modules react native vector icons edit info plist as described above if you are using use frameworks in your podfile you instead need to dynamically load the icon font by doing icon loadfont when boostrapping your application note you must be consuming react itself via cocoapods for this to work see react native documentation on how to set that up android option with gradle recommended this method has the advantage of fonts being copied from this module at build time so that the fonts and js are always in sync making upgrades painless edit android app build gradle not android build gradle and add the following gradle apply from node modules react native vector icons fonts gradle to customize the files being copied add the following instead gradle project ext vectoricons iconfontnames materialicons ttf evilicons ttf name of the font files you want to copy apply from node modules react native vector icons fonts gradle option manually copy the contents in the fonts folder to android app src main assets fonts note lowercase font folder integrating library for getimagesource and toolbarandroid support these steps are optional and only needed if you want to use the icon getimagesource function or using custom icons in the icon toolbarandroid

fonts to your project in xcode make sure your app is checked under add to targets and that create folder references is checked edit info plist and add a property called application fonts resource path or atsapplicationfontspath if xcode wont autocomplete not using xcode and type fonts as the value note you need to recompile your project after adding new fonts also ensure that the fonts folder also appear under copy bundle resources in build phases windows via react native windows open your solution in visual studio right click the assets folder in your solution click add existing browse to the node modules\react native vector icons\fonts folder select the required font files click the add drop down and select add as link set copy to output directory property of each font file to copy if newer note you need to recompile your project after adding new fonts web with webpack in your webpack configuration file add a section to handle ttf files using url loader or file loader js test \ ttf loader url loader or directly file loader include path resolve dirname node modules react native vector icons then consume those files in your javascript entry point to get the bundled url and inject a style tag in your page js use prebuilt version of rnvi in dist folder import icon from react native vector icons dist fontawesome generate required css import iconfont from react native vector icons

icons above or roll your own custom font js import icon from react native vector icons fontawesome const myicon icon name rocket size 30 color 900 properties any text property and the following prop description default size size of the icon can also be passed as fontsize in the style object 12 name what icon to show see icon explorer app or one of the links above none color color of the icon inherited you can use icon hasicon name to check if the name is valid in current icon set styling since icon builds on top of the text component most style properties will work as expected you might find it useful to play around with these backgroundcolor borderwidth bordercolor borderradius padding margin color fontsize note on android text doesnt currently support border styles to circumvent this simply wrap your icon with a view by combining some of these you can create for example icon button component a convenience component for creating buttons with an icon on the left side js import icon from react native vector icons fontawesome const mybutton login with facebook const customtextbutton login with facebook properties any text touchablehighlight or touchablewithoutfeedback property in addition to these prop description default color text and icon color use iconstyle or nest a text component if you need different colors white size icon size 20 iconstyle styles applied to the icon only good for setting margins or a different color note use iconstyle for margins or expect unstable behaviour marginright 10 backgroundcolor background color of the button 007aff borderradius border radius of the button set to 0 to disable 5 onpress a function called when the button is pressed none usage as png image source object convenient way to plug this in into other components that rely on bitmap images rather than scalable vector icons takes the arguments name size and color as described above icon getimagesource user 20 red then source this setstate usericon source for a complete example check out the tabbarexample project usage with tabbarios simply use icon tabbaritemios instead of tabbarios item this is an extended component that works exactly the same but with three additional properties prop description default iconname name of the default icon similar to tabbarios item icon none selectediconname name of the selected icon similar to tabbarios item selectedicon iconname iconsize size of the icon 30 iconcolor color of the icon none selectediconcolor color of the selected icon iconcolor for example usage see examples tabbarexample or the examples section below dont forget to import and link to this project as described above if you are going to use the tabbar integration note using iconcolor and selectediconcolor requires the attribute renderasoriginal to be set to true on icon tabbaritemios usage with navigatorios use icon getimagesource to get an image source object and pass it as you would with backbuttonicon leftbuttonicon or rightbuttonicon note since navigatorios doesnt rerender with new state and the async nature of getimagesource you must not use it with initialroute until the icon is rendered but any view added by push should be fine easiest way is to simple add an if statment at the beginning of you render method like this render if this state myicon return false return navigatorios facebook writes development belongs to open source community not used by the react native team on their apps a result of this is that there is currently a backlog of unresolved bugs nobody who uses this has stepped up to take ownership for it yet you are probably better off with navigator navigationbar or react native navbar usage with toolbarandroid simply use icon toolbarandroid instead of react toolbarandroid this is composition of the underlying toolbarandroid component that works the same but any icon property also takes iconname prop description default logoname name of the navigation logo icon similar to toolbarandroid logo none naviconname name of the navigation icon similar to toolbarandroid navicon none overflowiconname name of the overflow icon similar to toolbarandroid overflowicon none actions possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu takes the additional arguments iconname iconcolor and iconsize none iconsize size of the icons 24 iconcolor color of the icons black for example usage see examples iconexplorer index android jsor the examples section below dont forget to import and link to this project as described above if you are going to use the toolbarandroid integration custom fonts createiconset glyphmap fontfamily fontfile returns your own custom font based on the glyphmap where the key is the icon name and the value is either a utf 8 character or its character code fontfamily is the name of the font not the filename open the font in font book app or similar to learn the name optionally pass the third fontfile argument for android support it should be a path to the font file in you asset folder js import createiconset from react native vector icons const glyphmap icon name 1234 test ∆ const icon createiconset glyphmap fontname createiconsetfromfontello config fontfamily fontfile convenience method to create a custom font based on a fontello config file dont forget to import the font as described above and drop the config

icomoonconfig make sure youre using the download option in icomoon and use the json file thats included in the zip youve downloaded youll also need to import the ttf font file into your project following the instructions above ios you have to manually make a reference of your ttf on your xcodeproj resources folder animation react native comes with an amazing animation library called animated to use it with an icon simply create an animated component with this line const animatedicon animated createanimatedcomponent icon you can also use the higher level animation library react native
