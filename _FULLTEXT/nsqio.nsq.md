It promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee. See features & guarantees. Operationally, NSQ is easy to configure and deploy (all parameters are specified on the command line and compiled binaries have no runtime dependencies). For maximum flexibility, it is agnostic to data format (messages can be JSON, MsgPack, Protocol Buffers, or anything else). Official Go and Python libraries are available out of the box (as well as many other client libraries) and, if youre interested in building your own, theres a protocol spec. We publish binary releases for linux, darwin, freebsd and windows as well as an official Docker image. NOTE: master is our development branch and may not be stable at all times. In Production Code of Conduct Help us keep NSQ open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct. Authors NSQ was designed and developed by Matt Reiferson (@imsnakes) and Jehiah Czebotar (@jehiah) but wouldnt have been possible without the support of bitly and all our contributors.
