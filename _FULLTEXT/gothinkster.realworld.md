Instead, please edit: README.template.md Stay on the bleeding edge ‚Äî join our Gitter room! üéâ See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is built using any of our supported frontends and backends. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same API spec üòÆüòé While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a frameworks capabilities, they typically dont convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it. RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "Conduit".

Work In Progress: Meteor | Ruby Hyperloop | Firebase Create a new stack Know any of these frameworks (or one that isnt listed)?Create a new framework implementation >>> Or you can view upcoming stacks (WIPs) Note: All stacks that are a WIP are experimental and incomplete. Dont expect everything to work perfectly out of the box! How do I get up & running? Simply follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repos you want to get up and running. Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch? Yup! Weve built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from git init all the way to the production ready application. Start learning now >>> Community created resources Forks, tutorials, workshops, and other resources based on the RealWorld project: React+Redux / Node testing workshop by Kent C. Dodds Example repo showing the React+Redux and Node stacks working together w/ TDD Live recording of his workshop is available on YouTube A Real-World Comparison of Front-End Frameworks with Benchmarks by Jacek Schae Medium post comparing performance of various RealWorld frontends RealWorld React/NodeJS E2E Tests by Anish Karandikar A repo showing how to wire React frontend with NodeJS backend for a RealWorld fullstack Includes E2E integration tests that use Chrome Puppeteer and Mocha and work with CI systems like Travis CI and CircleCI Also demonstrates usage of Greenkeeper for automatic dependency updates and Snyk for vulnerability monitoring Performance comparisons: A Real-World Comparison of Front-End Frameworks with Benchmarks A Real-World Comparison of Front-End Frameworks with Benchmarks (2018 update) Learn more "Introducing RealWorld üôå" by Eric Simons Every tutorial is built against the same API spec to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend Every frontend utilizes the same hand crafted Bootstrap 4 theme for identical UI/UX There is a hosted version of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys required Interested in creating a new RealWorld stack? View our starter guide & spec Who made this? RealWorld would not be possible without the open source community continuously helping push the project forward.

Special thanks to... RealWorld wouldnt be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped contribute to RealWorld: Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for helping spark the initial idea, getting the Redux community involved, as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on the Redux codebase Max Lynch (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project Addy Osmani (creator of TodoMVC) for helping spark the initial idea and his amazing work with TodoMVC TodoMVC (team & contributors) for their exemplary & successful work; their project & org has been an invaluable analogy for us as weve built out RealWorld James Brewer (docs contributor to Django) for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial License All of the codebases are MIT licensed unless otherwise specified.
