Cleave.js Cleave.js has a simple purpose: to help you format input text content automatically. Features Credit card number formatting Phone number formatting (i18n js lib separated for each country to reduce size) Date formatting Numeral formatting Custom delimiter, prefix and blocks pattern CommonJS / AMD mode ReactJS component AngularJS directive (1.x) TL;DR the demo page Why? The idea is to provide an easy way to increase input field readability by formatting your typed data. By using this library, you wont need to write any mind-blowing regular expressions or mask patterns to format input text. However, this isnt meant to replace any validation or mask library, you should still sanitize and validate your data in backend. Installation npm bash npm install --save cleave.js old school Grab file from dist directory Usage Simply include html <script src="cleave.min.js"></script> <script src="cleave-phone.{country}.js"></script> cleave-phone.{country}.js addon is only required when phone shortcut mode is enabled. See more in documentation: phone lib addon section Then have a text field html <input class="input-phone" type="text"/> Now in your JavaScript js var cleave = new Cleave(.input-phone, { phone: true, phoneRegionCode: {country} }); .input-element here is a unique DOM element. If you want to apply Cleave for multiple elements, you need to give different css selectors and apply to each of them More examples: the demo page CommonJS ```js var Cleave = require(cleave.js); require(cleave.js/dist/addons/cleave-phone.{country}); var cleave = new Cleave(...) ``` AMD js require([cleave.js/dist/cleave.min, cleave.js/dist/addons/cleave-phone.{country}], function (Cleave) { var cleave = new Cleave(...) }); TypeScript Types are contributed by the community and are available via npm install --save-dev @types/cleave.js. Once installed, you can import Cleave like the following: ts import Cleave = require(cleave.js); Types for the React-component are also available and can be imported in the same way. ts import Cleave = require(cleave.js/react); ReactJS component usage ```js import React from react; import ReactDOM from react-dom; import Cleave from cleave.js/react; ``` Then in JSX: ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props, context) { super(props, context); this.onCreditCardChange = this.onCreditCardChange.bind(this); this.onCreditCardFocus = this.onCreditCardFocus.bind(this); } onCreditCardChange(event) { // formatted pretty value console.log(event.target.value); // raw value console.log(event.target.rawValue); } onCreditCardFocus(event) { // update some state } render() { return ( <Cleave placeholder="Enter your credit card number" options={{creditCard: true}} onFocus={this.onCreditCardFocus} onChange={this.onCreditCardChange} /> ); } } ``` As you can see, here you simply use <Cleave/> as a normal <input/> field Attach HTML <input/> attributes Pass in the custom options prop Add ReactJS onChange event listener Advanced usage: How to pass default value How to get ref of cleave instance and call methods How to update raw value How to get ref of the input field How to use it with redux form Usage for Webpack, Browserify and more in documentation: ReactJS component usage AngularJS directive usage First include the directive module: html <script src="cleave.js/dist/cleave-angular.min.js"></script> <script src="cleave.js/dist/addons/cleave-phone.{country}.js"></script> And in your model: ```js angular.module(app, [cleave.js]) .controller(AppController, function($scope) { $scope.onCreditCardTypeChanged = function(type) { $scope.model.creditCardType = type; }; $scope.model = { rawValue: }; $scope.options = { creditCard: { creditCard: true, onCreditCardTypeChanged: $scope.onCreditCardTypeChanged } }; }); ``` Then easily you can apply cleave directive to input field: html <div ng-controller="AppController"> <input ng-model="model.rawValue" ng-whatever="..." type="text" placeholder="Enter credit card number" cleave="options.creditCard"/> </div> More usage in documentation: Angular directive usage Playground Plain JSFiddle (Basic usage) Plain JSFiddle (More examples) React JSFiddle Angular JSFiddle Documentation JavaScript API Constructor Options Public methods Phone lib addon ReactJS component usage AngularJS directive usage Run tasks bash npm install Build assets bash gulp build Run tests bash gulp test Lint bash gulp eslint Publish (build, tests & lint) bash gulp publish For contributors, please run gulp publish to ensure your PR passes tests and lint, also we have a not in the plan list you may concern.
