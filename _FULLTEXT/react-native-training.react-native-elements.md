Release plan: Since this is a beta release, any new installation of react-native-elements will get v0.19.0. If you would like to try out our v1.0.0 beta releases (we highly suggest you do), run the following command: yarn add react-native-elements@beta Since v1 has a lot of API changes (many of which are breaking changes due to re-written components), the v1.0.0 beta releases are meant to give our users a heads up and give them plenty of time to migrate their apps to v1. The official v1.0.0 will be released around mid-March 2018 🎉 Test v1.0 components You can test new features of the v1.0.0 beta releases on Expo Snack by modifying the package.json file: "react-native-elements": "^1.0.0-beta" This will install the latest beta release of React Native Elements.
