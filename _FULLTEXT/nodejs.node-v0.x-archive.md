This repository is an archive of Node.js before the move to nodejs/node. It still contains issues and pull requests that are relevant to Node versions v0.10 and v0.12, and that were opened before the move to nodejs/node. New issues and pull requests, for all branches, should be opened at nodejs/node. New issues and pull requests opened here will automatically be rejected. The pre-convergence version of the README is available here.
