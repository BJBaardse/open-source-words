Protractor Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor is a Node.js program built on top of WebDriverJS. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would. Compatibility Protractor 5 is compatible with nodejs v6 and newer. Protractor works with AngularJS versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular applications. Note that for Angular apps, the binding and model locators are not supported. We recommend using by.css. Getting Started See the Protractor Website for most documentation.
