modest natural-language processing in javascript by Spencer Kelly and many contributors small enough for the browser... two gifs save yourself from regex-whackamole🤞: js nlp(entireNovel).sentences().if(the #Adjective of times).out() // "it was the blurst of times??" move things around: js nlp(she sells seashells by the seashore.).sentences().toFutureTense().out() // she will sell seashells... respond to text input: js if( doc.has(^simon says (shoot|fire) #Determiner lazer) ){ fireLazer() } else { dontFire() } compromise is not the cleverest. but it is small, quick, and good-enough for a bunch of stuff. three-table section <script src> one javascript file 🙏 npm install compromise 86% on the Penn treebank IE9+ caniuse, youbetcha Install section #### ⚡️ on the Client-side ```html var doc = nlp(dinosaur) var str = doc.nouns().toPlural().out(text) console.log(str) // dinosaurs ``` #### 🌋 Server-side! ```javascript var nlp = require(compromise) var doc = nlp(London is calling) doc.sentences().toNegative() // London is not calling ``` Get the hang of things: Tutorial #1 Input → output Tutorial #2 Match & transform Tutorial #3 Making a bot Detailed docs: API Full Tagset Plugins Outputs Match Syntax ## Examples: Part-of-Speech tagging nouns! verbs! adjectives! Named-entities people, places, organizations Number parsing seven hundred and fifty == 750 Grammar-match like a regex for a sentence Verb conjugation all your base are belong Normalization case, whitespace, contractions.. * Plural/singular: - grab the noun-phrases, make em plural: ```js doc = nlp(a bottle of beer on the wall.) doc.nouns(0).toPlural() doc.out(text) //The bottles of beer on the wall. ``` * Number parsing: - parse written-out numbers, and change their form: ```js doc = nlp(ninety five thousand and fifty two) doc.values().toNumber().out() // 95052 doc = nlp(the 23rd of December) doc.values().add(2).toText() doc.out(text) // the twenty fifth of December ``` * Normalization: - handle looseness & variety of random text: ```js doc = nlp("the guest-singers björk at seven thirty.").normalize().out(text) // The guest singer is Bjork at 7:30. ``` * Tense: - switch to/from conjugations of any verb ```js let doc = nlp(she sells seashells by the seashore.) doc.sentences().toFutureTense().out(text) //she will sell seashells... doc.verbs().conjugate() // [{ PastTense: sold, // Infinitive: sell, // Gerund: selling, ... // }] ``` * Contractions: - grab, expand and contract: ```js doc = nlp("were not gonna take it, no we aint gonna take it.") doc.has(going) // true doc.match(are not).length // == 2 doc.contractions().expand().out() //we are not going to take it, no we are not going to take it ``` * Named-entities: - get the people, places, organizations: ```js doc = nlp(the opera about richard nixon visiting china) doc.topics().data() // [ // { text: richard nixon }, // { text: china } // ] ``` * Custom lexicon: - make it do what youd like: ```js var lexicon={ boston: MusicalGroup } doc = nlp(i heard Boston\s set in Chicago, lexicon) //alternatively, fix it in-post: doc.match(heard #Possessive set).terms(1).tag(MusicalGroup) ``` * Handy outputs: - get sensible data: ```js doc = nlp(We like Roy! We like Roy!).sentences().out(array) // [We like Roy!, We like Roy!] doc = nlp(Tony Hawk).out(html) /* Tony Hawk */ ``` plugins section * Plugins: - allow adding vocabulary, fixing errors, and setting context quickly: ```js var plugin = { tags:{ Character:{ isA: Noun } }, words:{ itchy: Character, scratchy: Character } } nlp.plugin(plugin) nlp(`Couldnt Itchy share his pie with Scratchy?`).debug() /* couldnt - #Modal, #Verb itchy - #Character, #Noun share - #Infinitive, #Verb ... */ ``` of course, theres a lot more stuff. Join in - were fun, using semver, and moving fast: Twitter Slack group Mailing-list Projects Pull-requests ☂️ Isnt javascript too... yeah! it wasnt built to compete with the stanford tagger, and may not fit every project. string stuff is synchronous too, and parallelizing is weird. See here for information about speed & performance, and here> for project motivations 💃 Can it run on my arduino-watch? Only if its water-proof! Read quickStart for all sorts of funny environments. 🌎 Other Languages? okay! weve got work-in-progress forks for German and French, in the same philosophy. Get involved! ✨ Partial builds? compromise is one function so cant really be tree-shaken. .. and the tagging methods are competitive, so its not recommended to pull things out. Its best to load the library fully, given its smaller than this gif. A plug-in scheme is in the works. ### Also: * **[naturalNode](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural)** - fancier statistical nlp in javascript * **[superScript](http://superscriptjs.com/)** - clever conversation engine in js * **[nodeBox Linguistics](https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Linguistics)** - conjugation, inflection in javascript * **[reText](https://github.com/wooorm/retext)** - very impressive [text utilities](https://github.com/wooorm/retext/blob/master/doc/plugins.md) in javascript * **[jsPos](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jspos/)** - javascript build of the time-tested Brill-tagger * **[spaCy](https://spacy.io/)** - speedy, multilingual tagger in C/python For the former promise-library, see [jnewman/compromise](https://github.com/jnewman/compromise) (Thanks [Joshua](https://github.com/jnewman)!)
