Bytes cost money. They cost money to store, transport, and process. Simplicity should be our goal in all endeavours. Scream if you want to go smaller These files were edited by hand in Inkscape, then were minified using svgo and svgcleaner. Further smallification may be possible. Try it! Each of these has an xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" in the <svg> tag. This isnt strictly necessary - but some web browsers wont display them as an image without it. Rounded corners can be dropped - rx="80" - the effect can be done in CSS if you want. The background colour can also be excluded if youre including it elsewhere. Colours can be simplified. #FF0000 becomes red. The precision of the paths is mostly 0 decimal places. A few logos have 1 or 2 dp to make them look more accurate. The precision can be reduced if necessary. Think you can make them smaller? Tell me by raising an issue! Want more icons? Tell me by raising an issue! Think the icons look wrong? Compare them against the official logos. If they still look wrong, tell me by raising an issue! New! Icons also available in Android Vector Drawables so you can easily use them in Android apps.

Submitting Icons Id love you to submit something ðŸ˜¸ The rules are simple, your icon must: be under 1024 bytes. That is, the maximum file size is 1023 bytes. No arguments. fit inside a circle with radius 256 pixels. Set rx="50%" to check. have solid colours. No gradients or fades. represent a popular services current logo. Template At a minimum, your icon needs these components: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="..." role="img" viewBox="0 0 512 512"> <rect width="512" height="512" rx="15%" fill="#fff"/> ... </svg> Icon accessibility The super tiny icons are accessible by default. Each icon has: role="img", to expose the <svg> elements as images in the browsers accessibility tree aria-label="XYZ" (where XYZ is the icons brand name), to give the icon an accessible name Note: if using the <svg> as the src for an <img> element, the alt attribute should still be used on the <img> element because the ARIA is not recognised in this context. CSS-Tricks has also an article about accessible SVG icons. Guidelines This is the standard guideline. Use this to help with sizing your icons and they will look good no matter what border radius is chosen. Green is the safe zone, where the main body of the icon should be. Yellow is like a road shoulder, it is there if more space is needed. It should be used for protruding elements, like corners or ornaments. Red is off limits. It should not be touched by the icons. Red is also how a circular icon would look. To see how the logos look, you can play around with the corner radius size using our interactive tool Licenses The majority of these vector logos are based on someone elses work.
