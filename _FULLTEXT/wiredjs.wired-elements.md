wired-elements ðŸ‘‰ wiredjs.com Wired Elements is a series of basic UI Elements that have a hand drawn look. These can be used for wireframes, mockups, or just the fun hand-drawn look. The elements are drawn with enough randomness that no two renderings will be exactly the same - just like two separate hand drawn shapes.
