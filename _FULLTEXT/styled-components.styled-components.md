Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress üíÖ Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles ‚Äì using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier! styled-components is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native ‚Äì meaning its the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the documentation about React Native for more information. Supported by Front End Center. Thank you for making this possible!
