to run bundle update i18n before following steps below run bundle install use the install generators to set up spree shell rails g spree install user class spree user rails g spree auth install rails g spree gateway install installation options alternatively if you want to use the bleeding edge version of spree add this to your gemfile ruby gem spree github spree spree gem spree auth devise github spree spree auth devise gem spree gateway github spree spree gateway note the master branch is not guaranteed to ever be in a fully functioning state it is unwise to use this branch in a production system you care deeply about by default the installation generator rails g spree install will run migrations as well as adding seed and sample data and will copy frontend views for easy customization if spree frontend available this can be disabled using shell rails g spree install migrate false sample false seed false copy views false you can always perform any of these steps later by using these commands shell bundle exec rake railties install migrations bundle exec rake db migrate bundle exec rake db seed bundle exec rake spree sample load bundle issues if you encountered any problems with bundler please try downgrading to bundler 1 13 7 or earlier browse store http localhost 3000 browse admin interface http localhost 3000 admin if you have spree auth devise installed you can generate a

google analytics segment performance you may notice that your spree store runs slowly in development environment this can be because in development each asset css and javascript is loaded separately you can disable it by adding the following line to config environments development rb ruby config assets debug false developing spree spree is meant to be run within the context of rails application and the source code is essentially a collection of gems you can easily create a sandbox application inside of your cloned source directory for testing purposes clone the git repo shell git clone git github com spree spree git cd spree install the gem dependencies shell bundle install sandbox create a sandbox rails application for testing purposes which automatically perform all necessary database setup shell bundle exec rake sandbox start the server shell cd sandbox rails server running tests we use circleci to run the tests for spree you can see the build statuses at https circleci com gh spree spree each gem contains its own series of tests and for each directory you need to do a quick one time creation of a test application and then you can use it to run the tests for example to run the tests for the core project shell cd core bundle gemfile gemfile bundle exec rake test app bundle exec rspec spec if you would like to run specs against a particular database you may specify the dummy apps database which defaults to sqlite3 shell db postgres bundle exec rake test app if you want to run specs for only a single spec file shell bundle exec rspec spec models spree state spec rb if you want to run a particular line of spec shell bundle exec rspec spec models spree state spec rb 7 you can also enable fail fast in order to stop tests at the first failure shell fail fast true bundle exec rspec spec models state spec rb if you want to run the simplecov code coverage report shell coverage true bundle exec rspec spec if youre working on multiple facets of spree to test please ensure that you have a postgres user shell createuser s r postgres and also ensure that you have phantomjs installed as well shell brew update brew install phantomjs to execute all the tests you may want to run this command at the root of the spree project to generate test applications and run specs for all the facets shell bash build sh contributing spree is an open source project and we encourage contributions please review the contributing guidelines before contributing in the spirit of free software everyone is encouraged to help improve this project here are some ways you can contribute by using prerelease versions master branch by reporting bugs by translating to a new language by writing or editing documentation by writing specs by writing needed code or finishing code
