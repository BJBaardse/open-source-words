Simple Icons Free SVG icons for popular brands. See them all on one page at SimpleIcons.org. Contributions, corrections & requests can be made on GitHub. Started by Dan Leech. Usage General Usage Icons can be downloaded as SVGs directly from our website - simply click the icon you want, and the download should start automatically. CDN Usage Icons can be served from a CDN such as JSDelivr or Unpkg. Simply use the simple-icons npm package and specify a version in the URL like the following: html <img height="32" width="32" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@latest/icons/stackoverflow.svg" /> <img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@latest/icons/stackoverflow.svg" /> Node Usage The icons are also available through our npm package. To install, simply run: $ npm install simple-icons The API can then be used as follows: ```javascript const simpleIcons = require(simple-icons); console.log(simpleIcons[Google+]); / { title: Google+, hex: DC4E41, source: https://developers.google.com/+/branding-guidelines, svg: ... } / ``` Third Party Extensions WordPress Icons are also available on WordPress through a simple plugin created by @tjtaylo, which you can find here.
