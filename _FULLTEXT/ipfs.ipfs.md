IPFS is the Distributed Web A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Welcome to IPFS! Why not watch a video demo to get started?

IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. You can read more about its origins in the paper IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System. IPFS is becoming a new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. It sounds crazy. It is crazy. Want to see more? Check out Juan Benets talk at Sourcegraph - IPFS: The Permanent Web. Quick Summary IPFS is a protocol: - defines a content-addressed file system - coordinates content delivery - combines Kademlia + BitTorrent + Git IPFS is a filesystem: - has directories and files - mountable filesystem (via FUSE) IPFS is a web: - can be used to view documents like the web - files accessible via HTTP at https://ipfs.io/<path> - browsers or extensions can learn to use the ipfs:// URL or dweb:/ipfs/ URI schemes directly - hash-addressed content guarantees authenticity IPFS is modular: - connection layer over any network protocol - routing layer - uses a routing layer DHT (kademlia/coral) - uses a path-based naming service - uses bittorrent-inspired block exchange IPFS uses crypto: - cryptographic-hash content addressing - block-level deduplication - file integrity + versioning - filesystem-level encryption + signing support IPFS is p2p: - worldwide peer-to-peer file transfers - completely decentralized architecture - no central point of failure IPFS is a cdn: - add a file to the filesystem locally, and its now available to the world - caching-friendly (content-hash naming) - bittorrent-based bandwidth distribution IPFS has a name service: - IPNS, an SFS inspired name system - global namespace based on PKI - serves to build trust chains - compatible with other NSes - can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc to IPNS How IPFS Works To learn more about how IPFS works take a look at the Papers or Talks. You can also explore the Specs in writing.

This is the sort of thing that would have come out of ARPA/DARPA/IETF/BellLabs in another age. IPFS is a Free Open Source project, with hundreds of contributors. Current State of IPFS IPFS is a work in progress! Please note that IPFS is a work in progress. It is an ambitious plan to make the internet more free, open, secure, and high performance. It builds on the good ideas of numerous battle-tested distributed systems. Today, there is one main IPFS Protocol implementation (in Go) with more on the way (JavaScript, and Python). Alpha Distribution In February of 2015, the go-ipfs implementation was released as an "Alpha Distribution". Since then, go-ipfs has been making regular releases on the road towards Beta. Both js-ipfs and py-ipfs are in progress. Install IPFS Alpha Distribution Setup IPFS and Getting Started Going Online More Examples For an in-depth tutorial, see a Hands on Introduction. Security Issues and Disclosures The IPFS protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. And -- though IPFS is not production-ready yet -- many people are already running nodes in their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away! If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, by exposing a remote execution exploit -- please send your report privately to security@ipfs.io. Please DO NOT file a public issue. If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly. Project and Community The IPFS Project is now very large, with hundreds of contributors in our community. You are invited to join it! Here are some links to our communication channels: IPFS Community Forums for Discussion and Support Sprints and Project Management Contributing Guidelines You can also find our community on: IRC: #ipfs on chat.freenode.net for live help and some dev discussions (Logs) Google Group: ipfs-users@groups.google.com (low traffic) Twitter: @IPFSbot for some news. Project Links The IPFS Project is big -- there are many subprojects and related efforts. We will document the core ones here, though you should look around. The space is exploding and lots of new projects are springing up all the time. For a community-curated lists of awesome projects using IPFS, check out awesome-ipfs!
