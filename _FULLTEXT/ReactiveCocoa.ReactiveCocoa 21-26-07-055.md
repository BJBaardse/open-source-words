reactive extensions to cocoa frameworks built on top of reactiveswift ‚ö†Ô∏è looking for the objective c api üéâ migrating from rac 4 x üöÑ release roadmap what is reactiveswift reactiveswift offers composable declarative and flexible primitives that are built around the grand concept of streams of values over time these primitives can be used to uniformly represent common cocoa and generic programming patterns that are fundamentally an act of observation for more information about the core primitives see reactiveswift what is reactivecocoa reactivecocoa wraps various aspects of cocoa frameworks with the declarative reactiveswift primitives ui bindings ui components expose bindingtarget s which accept bindings from any kind of streams of values via the operator swift bind the name property of person to the text value of an uilabel namelabel reactive text person name note youll need to import reactiveswift as well to make use of the operator controls and user interactions interactive ui components expose signal s for control events and updates in the control value upon user interactions a selected set of controls provide a convenience expressive binding api for action s swift updateallowscookies whenever the toggle is flipped preferences allowscookies toggle reactive isonvalues compute live character counts from the continuous stream of user initiated changes in the text textfield reactive continuoustextvalues map 0 characters count trigger commit whenever the button is pressed button reactive pressed cocoaaction viewmodel commit declarative objective c dynamism create signals that are sourced by intercepting objective c objects e g method call interception and object deinitialization swift notify after every timeviewwillappear is called let appearing viewcontroller reactive trigger for selector uiviewcontroller viewwillappear observe the lifetime of object object reactive lifetime ended observecompleted docleanup expressive safe key path observation establish key value observations in the form of signalproducer s and dynamicpropertys and enjoy the inherited composability swift a producer that sends the current value ofkeypath followed by subsequent changes terminate the kvo observation if the lifetime ofself ends let producer object reactive values forkeypath keypath key take during self reactive lifetime a parameterized property that represents the supplied key path of the wrapped object it holds a weak reference to the wrapped object let property dynamicproperty object person keypath keypath person name but there are still more to be discovered and introduced read our in code documentations and release notes to find out more getting started reactivecocoa supports macos 10 9 ios 8 0 watchos 2 0 and tvos 9 0 carthage if you use carthage to manage your dependencies simply add reactivecocoa to your cartfile github reactivecocoa reactivecocoa 7 0 if you use carthage to build your dependencies make sure you have added reactivecocoa framework reactiveswift framework and result framework to the linked frameworks and libraries section of your target and have included them in your carthage framework copying build phase cocoapods if you use cocoapods to manage your dependencies simply add reactivecocoa to your podfile pod reactivecocoa 7 0 git submodule add the reactivecocoa repository as a submodule of your applications repository run git submodule update init recursive from within the reactivecocoa folder drag and drop reactivecocoa xcodeproj carthage checkouts reactiveswift reactiveswift xcodeproj and carthage checkouts result result xcodeproj into your applications xcode project or workspace on the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù tab of your application targets settings add reactivecocoa framework reactiveswift framework and result framework to the ‚Äúembedded binaries‚Äù section if your application target does not contain swift code at all you should also set the embedded content contains swift build setting to ‚Äúyes‚Äù have a question if you need any help please visit our github issues or stack overflow feel free to file an issue if you do not manage to find any solution from the archives release roadmap current stable release in development plan of record abi stability release reactivecocoa is expected to declare library abi stability when swift rolls out resilence support in swift 5 until then reactivecocoa will incrementally adopt new language features
