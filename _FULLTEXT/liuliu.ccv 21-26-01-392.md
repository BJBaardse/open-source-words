build status travis ci vm linux x64 raspberry pi 3 jetson tk1 jetson tx2 backstory i set to build ccv with a minimalism inspiration that was back in 2010 out of the frustration with the computer vision library then i was using ccv was meant to be a much easier to deploy simpler organized code with a bit caution with dependency hygiene the simplicity and minimalistic nature at then made it much easier to integrate into any server side deployment environments portable and embeddable fast forward to now the world is quite different from then but ccv adapts pretty well in this new mobile first environment it now runs on mac osx linux freebsd windows iphone ipad android raspberry pi in fact anything that has a proper c compiler probably can run ccv the majority with notable exception of convolutional networks which requires a blas library of ccv will just work with no compilation flags or dependencies modern computer vision algorithms one core concept of ccv development is application driven thus ccv ends up implementing a handful state of art algorithms it includes a close to state of the art image classifier a state of the art frontal face detector reasonable collection of object detectors for pedestrians and cars a useful text detection algorithm a long term general object tracking algorithm and the long standing feature point extraction algorithm clean interface with cached image preprocessing many computer vision tasks nowadays consist of quite a few preprocessing layers image pyramid generation color space conversion etc these potentially redundant operations cannot be easily eliminated within a mature api ccv provides a built in cache mechanism that while maintains a clean function interface effectively does transparent cache for you for computer vision community there is no shortage of good algorithms good implementation is what it lacks of after years we stuck in between either the high performance battle tested but old algorithm implementations or the new shining but matlab algorithms ccv is my take on this problem hope you enjoy it license ccv source code is distributed under bsd 3 clause license ccvs data models and documentations are distributed under creative commons attribution 4 0 international license
