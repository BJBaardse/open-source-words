Code Examples: Mastering Bitcoin Mastering Bitcoin is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover bitcoin at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of bitcoin. This repository contains the complete first edition, second print, published in December 2014, and the complete second edition, second print, published in July 2017, as published by OReilly Media in paperback and ebook formats.

If you would like to contribute extensive changes or new material, please coordinate with the author first; contact information can be found on his web site: https://antonopoulos.com/ Reading this book (Where is the PDF?) To read this book, see book.asciidoc. Click on each of the chapters to read in your browser. This is not as convenient as reading a PDF or an ebook on your e-reader, for which there is a cost (see below). The 2nd edition of "Mastering Bitcoin" is available under a CC-BY-NC-ND license, not a CC-BY-SA license. It is deliberately not available as a PDF. Why? Because a PDF is a "derivative" product, which is what the ND prohibits. Thats because the publisher (OReilly Media) is a for-profit publisher who puts considerable resources behind distributing the book. The book will eventually (within a year of publication) be released under a CC-BY-SA license, at which point the PDF format and translations will be allowed. Until then, making PDF copies violates the license and interferes with the publishers (and the authors) ability to make a living. Furthermore, if you make it so the publisher cant recoup their investment, they will delay the release into CC-BY-SA. Please dont create or distribute PDFs until the license is changed to CC-BY-SA. It is rare for a publisher to even agree to a CC-BY-NC-ND license. Dont make it harder for free culture by violating even that, already generous, license.
