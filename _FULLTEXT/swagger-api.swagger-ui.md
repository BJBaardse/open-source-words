Swagger UI üëâüèº Want to score an easy open-source contribution? Check out our Good first issue label. üï∞Ô∏è Looking for the older version of Swagger UI? Refer to the 2.x branch. This repository publishes to two different NPM modules: swagger-ui is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc). swagger-ui-dist is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger-UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that cant resolve npm module dependencies. We strongly suggest that you use swagger-ui instead of swagger-ui-dist if youre building a single-page application, since swagger-ui-dist is significantly larger.
