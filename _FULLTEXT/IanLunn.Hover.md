Then just add the class name of the effect to the element youd like it applied to. A. Copy and Paste an Effect If you plan on only using one or several effects, its better practice to copy and paste an effect into your own stylesheet, so a user doesnt have to download css/hover.css in its entirety. Assuming you want to use the Grow effect: Download Hover.css In css/hover.css, find the Grow CSS (each effect is named using a comment above it): ```css / Grow / .hvr-grow { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; transform: translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); backface-visibility: hidden; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; transition-duration: 0.3s; transition-property: transform; } .hvr-grow:hover, .hvr-grow:focus, .hvr-grow:active { transform: scale(1.1); } `` 3. Copy this effect and then paste it into your own stylesheet. 4. In the HTML file which youd like the effect to appear, add the class of.hvr-grow` to your chosen element. Example element before applying Hover.css effect: html <a href="#">Add to Basket</a> Example element after applying Hover.css effect: html <a href="#" class="hvr-grow">Add to Basket</a> Note: As of 2.0.0 all Hover.css class names are prefixed with hvr- to prevent conflicts with other libraries/stylesheets. If using Sass/LESS, this can easily be changed using the $nameSpace/@nameSpace variable in scss/_options.scss or less/_options.less. B. Reference Hover.css If you plan on using many Hover.css effects, you may like to reference the entire Hover.css stylesheet. Download hover-min.css Add hover-min.css to your websites files, in a directory named css for example Reference hover-min.css in <head> of the HTML page youd like to add Hover.css effects to: html <head> <link href="css/hover-min.css" rel="stylesheet"> </head> Alternatively you can add a reference into an existing stylesheet like so (this may be useful to WordPress users who are unable to edit HTML): css @import url("hover-min.css"); Assuming you want to use the Grow effect, in the HTML file youd like to use this effect, add the class of .hvr-grow to your chosen element. Example element before applying Hover.css effect: html <a href="#" class="button">Add to Basket</a> Example element after applying Hover.css effect: html <a href="#" class="button hvr-grow">Add to Basket</a> A Note on the display Property To make an element "transformable", Hover.css gives the following to all elements it is applied to: css display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; Should you wish to override this behavior, either remove the above CSS from Hover.css or change the display property for the element. Be sure to declare the override after the Hover.css declarations so the CSS cascade will take effect. Alternatively, if you are using the Sass/LESS version of Hover.css, you can remove/comment out the forceBlockLevel() mixin found in scss/_hacks.scss or less/_hacks.less. For more information about Transformable elements, see the CSS Transforms Module. Using Icon Effects To add a Hover.css icon, place the icon HTML inside the element that a Hover.css effect is applied to. For example: <a href="#" class="hvr-icon-forward"> Icon Forward <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right hvr-icon"></i> </a> In the above code, we have given a link element a class of hvr-icon-forward which will make an icon move forward when the link is hovered over. The icon itself is given a class of hvr-icon to let Hover.css know that this is the icon we want to animate. In this example, our icon is from FontAwesome, which weve loaded into the <head></head> of our web page as per FontAwesomes instructions, like so: html <link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all"> Note: As of Hover.css v2.3.0 you can use any method you like for adding icons (previously, only FontAwesome was supported out-of-the-box.) For example, you could use another icon library or instead, use an image like so: <a href="#" class="hvr-icon-spin"> Icon Spin <img src="myicon.svg" class="hvr-icon" /> </a> Here, the image will act as the icon because it has the hvr-icon class applied to it, and when hovered over, the icon will spin as defined by the hvr-icon-spin class on the parent element. Position of the icon is entirely in your control. You could place it before the text, like so: <a href="#" class="hvr-icon-spin"> <img src="myicon.svg" class="hvr-icon" /> Icon Spin </a> Or use custom CSS to position the icon as you see fit. Whats Included? The project consists of the following folders and files: css demo-page.css - Contains styles to demonstrate Hover. Not required in your projects hover-min.css - The minified/production version of Hover.css hover.css - The development version of Hover.css scss/less effects - Contains each individual effect sorted into categorized folders _hacks.scss/_hacks.less, _mixins.scss/_mixins.less, _options.scss/_options.less - Sass/LESS Utilities hover.scss/hover.less - Development version of Hover.css in Sass and LESS flavours Other Other files of note include: index.html - Demonstrates all Hover.css effects Gruntfile.js - Used for development of Hover.css via Grunt. Browser Support Many Hover.css effects rely on CSS3 features such as transitions, animations, transforms and pseudo-elements, for that reason, effects may not fully work in older browsers. Transitions and Animations - not supported below Internet Explorer 10 Transforms - not supported below Internet Explorer 9 Generated Content (pseudo-elements) - not supported below Internet Explorer 8 Aside from the above mentioned browsers, Hover.css is supported across all major browsers. Please see caniuse.com for full support for many web technologies and test your webpages accordingly. It is recommended to apply fallback effects for older browsers, using CSS supported by those browsers or a feature testing library such as Modernizr. Using Grunt for Development Grunt is non-essential but can speed up development. With Grunt installed, run grunt from the command line to set up a development server accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or your local IP for network testing. With Grunt running, Sass or LESS will be preprocessed (depending on whether you work out of the scss or less folder) and CSS files will be minified. Note: Originally Grunt was set up to autoprefix CSS properties but to make the project as accessible as possible, this is no longer the case. The prefixed(property, value) Sass/LESS mixin should be used for browser prefixing instead. See Using Sass/LESS for Development and [Using LESS for Development]. Using Sass/LESS for Development Sass/LESS are non-essential but can speed up development. Preprocess Sass/LESS with your favourite software or the environment provided via Grunt. Sass/LESS is used in the Hover.css project to separate various CSS into specific files. Each effect is within its own file in the effects directory. Hover.css also uses the following .scss and .less files: _hacks Contains hacks (undesirable but usually necessary lines of code) applied to certain effects. Hacks explained here. _mixins Contains prefixed and keyframes mixins that apply the necessary prefixes you specify in _options.scss / _options.less to properties and keyframes. Properties can be prefixed like so: Sass: css @include prefixed(transition-duration, .3s); LESS: css .prefixed(transition-duration, .3s); The prefixed mixin is passed the property you want to prefix, followed by its value. Keyframes can be prefixed like so: Sass: css @include keyframes(my-animation) { to { color: red; } } The keyframes mixin is passed the keyframe name, followed by the content using the @content directive. LESS: css .keyframes(my-animation, { to { color: red; } }); The keyframes mixin is passed the keyframe name, followed by the content, both as arguments. _options Contains default options, various effect options and the browser prefixes youd like to use with the prefixed mixin. By default, only the -webkit- prefix is set to true (due to most browsers not requiring prefixes now). As of 2.0.0, _options also includes a $nameSpace / @nameSpace option which allows you to change the name all classes are prefixed with. The default namespace is hvr. The $includeClasses / @includeClasses option by default is set to true and will generate all Hover.css effects under their own class names, hvr-grow for example. Should you wish to add the properties that make up Hover.css effects to your own class names, set this option to false.
