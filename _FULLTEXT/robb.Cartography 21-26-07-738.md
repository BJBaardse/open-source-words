cartography iphone triangular ruler using cartography you can set up your auto layout constraints in declarative code and without any stringly typing in short it allows you to replace this swift addconstraint nslayoutconstraint item button1 attribute right relatedby equal toitem button2 attribute left multiplier 1 0 constant 12 0 with this swift constrain button1 button2 button1 button2 in button1 right button2 left 12 if you end up using cartography in production id love to hear from you you can reach me through twitter or email if you need swift 2 x support then please use 0 7 0 and below installation cocoapods to integrate cartography into your xcode project using cocoapods specify it in your podfile ruby target your target name do pod cartography 3 0 end then run the following command bash pod install usage call the constrain function with your uiview or nsview instances as well as a closure in which you declare the constraints between the different attributes of your views swift constrain view1 view2 view1 view2 in view1 width view1 superview width 50 0 5 view2 width view1 width 50 view1 height 40 view2 height view1 height view1 centerx view1 superview centerx view2 centerx view1 centerx view1 top view1 superview top 20 view2 top view1 bottom 20 for every view on the left hand side of an equality or inequality operator cartography will automatically set its translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints property to false if the view is not controlled by you–for example if it belongs to a apple provided uiviewcontroller class–you should take appropriate care when declaring its constraints replacing constraints you can capture multiple constraints in a group to then replace them with new constraints at a later point swift constrain view view in view width 100 view height 100 let group constraintgroup attach view to the top left corner of its superview constrain view replace group view in view top view superview top view left view superview left later move the view to the bottom right corner of its superview constrain view replace group view in view bottom view superview bottom view right view superview right uiview animate withduration 0 5 animations view layoutifneeded for convenience the constrain functions also returns constraintgroup instances swift let group constrain button button in button width 100 button height 400 supported attributes cartography supports all built in attributes as of ios 8 and os x 10 9 those are width height top right bottom left leading trailing centerx centery baseline as well as the ios specific firstbaseline leftmargin rightmargin topmargin bottommargin leadingmargin trailingmargin centerxwithinmargins centerywithinmargins edgeswithinmargins these can be further refined using the following operators and additionally it supports convenient compound attributes that allow you to assign multiple attributes at once swift constrain view view in view size view superview size 2 view center view superview center swift constrain view view in view edges inset view superview edges 20 20 40 20 aligning multiple view if you need to align multiple views by a common edge you can use the align functions swift constrain view1 view2 view3 view1 view2 view3 in align top view1 view2 view3 which is equivalent to view1 top view2 top view2 top view3 top similar variants exist for top right bottom left leading trailing centerx centery and baseline distributing views evenly for distributing multiple views either horizontally or vertically you can use the distribute functions swift constrain view1 view2 view3 view1 view2 view3 in distribute by 10 horizontally view1 view2 view3 which is equivalent to view1 trailing view2 leading 10 view2 trailing view3 leading 10 setting priorities you can set the priorities of your constraints using the operator swift constrain view view in view width 200 uilayoutpriority 100 view height 200 required capturing constraints since the and emit nslayoutconstraint instances you can capture their results if you need to refer to the layout constraints at a later time swift var width nslayoutconstraint constrain view view in width view width 200 100 note that declaring compound attributes returns multiple constraints at once swift var constraints nslayoutconstraint constrain view view in constraints view size view superview size defaultlow documentation read the documentation here for more information see the gh pages branch versioning for swift 3 x versions 1 1 0 for swift 4 x versions 2 0 0 support please dont hesitate to file an issue if you have questions about cartography cartography was built by robb böhnke is maintained by orta therox and was inspired by the excellent flkautolayout by florian kugler
