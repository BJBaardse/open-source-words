Homebrew-Cask ‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more! Homebrew-Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Atom and Google Chrome. We do this by providing a friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries. Lets try it! To start using Homebrew-Cask, you just need Homebrew installed. Slower, now: ``` $ brew cask install atom ==> Satisfying dependencies complete ==> Downloading https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.8.0/atom-mac.zip ################################################################## 100.0% ==> Verifying checksum for Cask atom ==> Moving App Atom.app to /Applications/Atom.app ==> Symlinking Binary apm to /usr/local/bin/apm ==> Symlinking Binary atom.sh to /usr/local/bin/atom üç∫ atom was successfully installed! ``` And there we have it. Atom installed with one quick command: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping. Learn More Find basic documentation on using Homebrew-Cask in USAGE.md Want to contribute a Cask? Awesome!
