gensim â€“ topic modelling in python gensim is a python library for topic modelling document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora target audience is the natural language processing nlp and information retrieval ir community features all algorithms are memory independent w r t the corpus size can process input larger than ram streamed out of core intuitive interfaces easy to plug in your own input corpus datastream trivial streaming api easy to extend with other vector space algorithms trivial transformation api efficient multicore implementations of popular algorithms such as online latent semantic analysis lsa lsi svd latent dirichlet allocation lda random projections rp hierarchical dirichlet process hdp or word2vec deep learning distributed computing can run latent semantic analysis and latent dirichlet allocation on a cluster of computers extensive documentation and jupyter notebook tutorials if this feature list left you scratching your head you can first read more about the vector space model and unsupervised document analysis on wikipedia support please raise potential bugs on github see contribution guide prior to raising an issue if you have an open ended or a research question mailing list is the best option gitter chat room is also available installation this software depends on numpy and scipy two python packages for scientific computing you must have them installed prior to installing gensim it is also recommended you install a fast blas library before installing numpy this is optional but using an optimized blas such as atlas or openblas is known to improve performance by as much as an order of magnitude on os x numpy picks up the blas that comes with it automatically so you dont need to do anything special the simple way to install gensim is pip install u gensim or if you have instead downloaded and unzipped the source tar gz package youd run python setup py test python setup py install for alternative modes of installation without root privileges development installation optional install features see the documentation this version has been tested under python 2 7 3 5 and 3 6 gensims github repo is hooked against travis ci for automated testing on every commit push and pull request support for python 2 6 3 3 and 3 4 was dropped in gensim 1 0 0 install gensim 0 13 4 if you must use python 2 6 3 3 or 3 4 support for python 2 5 was dropped in gensim 0 10 0 install gensim 0 9 1 if you must use python 2 5 how come gensim is so fast and memory efficient isnt it pure python and isnt python slow and greedy many scientific algorithms can be expressed in terms of large matrix operations see the blas note above gensim taps into these low level blas libraries by means of its dependency on numpy so while gensim the top level code is pure python it actually executes highly optimized fortran c under the hood including multithreading if your blas is so configured memory wise gensim makes heavy use of pythons built in generators and iterators for streamed data processing memory efficiency was one of gensims design goals and is a central feature of gensim rather than something bolted on as an
