1 to any diff url will remove any changes only in whitespace enabling you to see only the code that has changed read more about github secrets adjust tab space adding ts 4 to a diff or file url will display tab characters as 4 spaces wide instead of the default 8 the number after ts can be adjusted to suit your preference this does not work on gists or raw file views but a chrome or opera extension can automate this here is a go source file before adding ts 4 and this is after adding ts 4 commit history by author to view all commits on a repo by author add author user to the url https

github com user repo branches you would see a list of all branches which are not merged into the main branch from here you can access the compare page or delete a branch with a click of a button comparing branches to use github to compare branches change the url to look like this https github com user repo compare range where range master 4 1 stable for example https github com rails rails compare master 4 1 stable range can be changed to things like https github com rails rails compare master 1 day ago master https github com rails rails compare master 2014 10 04 master here dates are in the format yyyy mm dd branches can also be compared in diff and patch views https github com rails rails compare master 4 1 stable diff https github com rails rails compare master 4 1 stable patch

user repo compare foreign user branch own branch for example https github com rails rails compare byroot master master gists gists are an easy way to work with small bits of code without creating a fully fledged repository add pibb to the end of any gist url like this in order to get the html only version suitable for embedding in any other site gists can be treated as a repository so they can be cloned like any other bash git clone https gist github com tiimgreen 10545817 this means you also can modify and push updates to gists bash git commit git push username for https gist github com password for https tiimgreen gist github com however gists do not support directories all files need to be added to the repository root read more about creating gists git io git io is a simple url

repository which can be retrieved locally in several ways retrieve a specific pull request and store it temporarily in fetch head for quickly diff ing or merge ing bash git fetch origin refs pull pr

by adding these corresponding lines in your repositorys git config remote origin fetch refs heads refs remotes origin url git github com tiimgreen github cheat sheet git remote origin fetch refs heads refs remotes origin url git github com tiimgreen github cheat sheet git fetch refs pull head refs remotes origin pr for fork based pull request contributions its useful to checkout a remote branch representing the pull request and create a local branch from it bash git checkout pr 42 pr 42 or should you work on more repositories you can globally configure fetching pull requests in the global git config instead bash git config global add remote origin fetch refs pull head refs remotes origin pr this way you can use the following short commands in all your repositories bash git fetch origin

git gives suggestions for misspelled commands and if auto correct is enabled the command can be fixed and executed automatically auto correct is enabled by specifying an integer which is the delay in tenths of a second before git will run the corrected command zero is the default value where no correcting will take place and a negative value will run the corrected command with no delay for example if you type git comit you will get this bash git comit m message git comit is not a git command see git help did you mean this commit auto correct can be enabled like this with a 1 5 second delay bash git config global help autocorrect 15 so now the command git comit will be auto corrected to git commit like this bash git comit m message warning you called a git command named comit which does not exist continuing under the assumption that you meant commit in 1 5 seconds automatically the delay before git will rerun the command is so the user has time to abort color to add more color to your
