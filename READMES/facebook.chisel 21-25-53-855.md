chisel chisel is a collection of lldb commands to assist in the debugging of ios apps installation • commands • custom commands • development workflow contributing • license for a comprehensive overview of lldb and how chisel complements it read ari grants dancing in the debugger — a waltz with lldb in issue 19 of objc io installation shell brew update brew install chisel if lldbinit file doesnt exist you can create it open it by tapping on the terminal shell touch lldbinit open lldbinit then add the following line to your lldbinit file python lldbinit command script import usr local opt chisel libexec fblldb py alternatively download chisel and add the following line to your lldbinit file python lldbinit command script import path to fblldb py the commands will be available the next time xcode starts commands there are many commands heres a few compatibility with ios mac indicated at right command description ios os x pviews print the recursive view description for the key window yes yes pvc print the recursive view controller description for the key window yes no visualize open a uiimage cgimageref uiview calayer nsdata of an image uicolor cicolor or cgcolorref in preview app on your mac yes no fv find a view in the hierarchy whose class name matches the provided regex yes no fvc find a view controller in the hierarchy whose class name matches the provided regex yes no show hide show or hide the given view or layer you dont even have to continue the process to see the changes yes yes mask unmask overlay a view or layer with a transparent rectangle to visualize where it is yes no border unborder add a border to a view or layer to visualize where it is yes yes caflush flush the render server equivalent to a repaint if no animations are in flight yes yes bmessage set a symbolic breakpoint on the method of a class or the method of an instance without worrying which class in the hierarchy actually implements the method yes yes wivar set a watchpoint on an instance variable of an object yes yes presponder print the responder chain starting from the given object yes yes and many more to see the list of all of the commands execute the help command in lldb or go to the wiki python lldb help the following is a list of built in permanent debugger commands the following is a list of your current user defined commands the bottom of the list will contain all of the commands sourced from chisel you can also inspect a specific command by passing its name as an argument to the help command as with all other lldb commands lldb help border draws a border around color and width can be optionally provided arguments type uiview the view to border options color c type string a color name such as red green magenta etc width w type cgfloat desired width of border syntax border color color width width all of the commands provided by chisel come with verbose help be sure to read it when in doubt custom commands you can add local custom commands heres a contrived example python usr bin python example file with custom commands located at magical commands example py import lldb import fblldbbase as fb def lldbcommands return printkeywindowlevel class printkeywindowlevel fb fbcommand def name self return pkeywinlevel def description self return an incredibly contrived command that prints the window level of the key window def run self arguments options its a good habit to explicitly cast the type of all return values and arguments lldb cant always find them on its own lldb debugger handlecommand p cgfloat id id uiapplication sharedapplication keywindow windowlevel then all thats left is to source the commands in lldbinit chisel has a python function just for this loadcommandsindirectory in the fblldb py module python lldbinit command script import path to fblldb py script fblldb loadcommandsindirectory magical commands theres also builtin support to make it super easy to specify the arguments and options that a command takes see the border and pinvocation commands for example use development workflow developing commands whether for local use or contributing to chisel directly both follow the same workflow create a command as described in the custom commands section and then start lldb reach a breakpoint or simply pause execution via the pause button in xcodes debug bar or process interrupt if attached directly execute command source lldbinit in lldb to source the commands run the command you are working on modify the command optionally run script reload modulename repeat steps 3 6 until the command becomes a source of happiness contributing please contribute any generic commands that you make if it helps you then it will likely help many others d see contributing md to learn how to contribute license chisel is bsd licensed see license
