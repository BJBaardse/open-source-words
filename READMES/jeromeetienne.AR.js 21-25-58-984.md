ar js augmented reality for the web i am focusing hard on making ar for the web a reality this repository is where i publish the code contact me anytime jerome etienne stuff are still moving fast we reached a good status tho an article has been published on uploadvr so i wanted to publish thus people can try it and have fun with it very fast it runs efficiently even on phones 60 fps on my 2 year old phone web based it is a pure web solution so no installation required full javascript based on three js jsartoolkit5 open source it is completely open source and free of charge standards it works on any phone with webgl and webrtc try it on mobile it works on all platforms android ios and window phone it run any browser with webgl and webrtc for ios you need to update to ios11 to try on your phone is only 2 easy steps check it out open this hiro marker image in your desktop browser open this augmented reality webapps in your phone browser and point it to your screen you are done it will open a webpage which read the phone webcam localize a hiro marker and add 3d on top of it as you can see below standing on the shoulders of giants so we shown it is now possible to do 60fps web based augmented reality on a phone this is great for sure but how did we get here by standing on the shoulders of giants it is thanks to the hard work from others that we can today reach this mythic 60fps ar so i would like to thank three js for being a great library to do 3d on the web artoolkit years of development and experiences on doing augmented reality emscripten and asm js thus we could compile artoolkit c into javascript chromium thanks for being so fast only thanks to all of them i could do my part optimizing performance from 5fps on high end phone to 60fps on 2years old phone after all this work done by a lot of people we have a web based augmented reality solution fast enough for mobile now many people got a phone powerful enough to do web ar in their pocket i think this performance improvement makes web ar a reality i am all exited by what people are going to do with it performance we are still early in the project but here are some initial numbers to give you an idea i got 60fps stable on nexus6p some reports sony xperia z2 2 5 years old runs around 50fps this is a 170euro phone some reports 50fps on a old nexus5 and 60fps on nexus 9 nexus5 is 3 5 years old some reports it working on windows phone edge 13fps on lumia 950 for some 40 45fps on lumia 930 for others obviously your mileage may vary the performance you get will depend on 3 things how heavy your 3d is how you tune your parameters and the hardware that you are using full featured marker based with this project we bring more performance to artoolkit artoolkit is a software with years of experience doing augmented reality it is able to do a lot it is marker based it supports a wide range of markers multiple types of markers pattern barcode multiple independent markers at the same time or multiple markers acting as a single marker up to you to choose whats new recently weve been getting creative and working on developing new things with ar js one of them is playing around with shadows syncing the position of virtual lights with reality for a more life like finish weve been collaborating very closely with fredrick blomqvist his input has had a great impact on ar js innovation and we want to thank him together weve been implementing refraction giving the 3d a transparent glassy effect it ended up having a nice polished look what do you guys think other crazy ideas weve been working on include a hole in the wall and a portal into another world we want to take ar js to new dimensions principles shared ar is a lot more real than solo ar augmented reality principle tweet the marker must be a portal from where the virtual emerges by andraconnect ar principles at dinner üòè tweet status at the three js level is the main one it is working well and efficiently a frame component it export a marker tag it becomes real easy to use it allows the things three js extension does here are some slides aframe artoolkit webvr polyfill it is kind of working still a work in progress augmented reality for the web in less than 10 lines of html a frame magic all details are explained in this super post augmented reality in 10 lines of html ar js with a frame

a full application on phone step by steps with explaination and videos very great the perfect step if you want to start writing ar application today great post about webar for designer by nexus

with your own image arcode generator generator of ar code source webar playground playground running in webar with ar js chromiumar all examples folders three js is the extension to use it with pure three js aframe is the extension to use it with a frame webvr polyfill is the webvr polyfill so you can reuse your ar vr content easily licenses it is all open source jsartoolkit5 is under lgplv3 license and additional permission and all my code in ar js repository is under mit license for legal details be sure to check jsartoolkit5 license and ar js license change log changelog md whats next we did good on performance but there are still a lot of room for optimisation using webworkers would increase cpu usage compiling in webassembly instead of asm js should improve loading time and likely cpu performance and obviously we can still do more parameters tweaking i would like people start experience augmented reality and play with it this is highly creative just look at this puzzle game in ar playing with mirror and laser beam you could do it with ar js so opensource and running on normal phones no need to buy a new device isnt that great augmented reality on phone have applications in many fields history education science or gaming i exited to see what people will do with ar js browser support demo tested on the following browser setups desktop chrome with webcam and 2 tabs one for hero one for result works android native 4 4 2 doesnt work doesnt ask for permission to use camera i see white background and text android native 5 0 doesnt work doesnt ask for permission i see white background and text chrome on android 4 4 2 works chrome on android 5 0 doesnt work asks for permission i see black background text and a chart safari and chrome on ios 8 2 ipad doesnt work doesnt ask for permission i see white background and text microsoft edge on windows 10 chrome on google pixel phone to view hologram credits hellodeadline sorianog future future md faq faq
