here is a google chrome firefox safari opera and thunderbird extension that lets you write email† in markdown‡ and render them before sending it also supports syntax highlighting just specify the language in a fenced code block writing email with code in it is pretty tedious writing markdown with code in it is easy i found myself writing email in markdown in the github in browser editor then copying the preview into email this is a pretty absurd workflow so i decided create a tool to write and render markdown right in the email to discover what can be done with markdown in markdown here

in chrome firefox safari opera log into your gmail hotmail or yahoo account and start a new email in thunderbird start a new message make sure youre using the rich editor in gmail click the rich formatting link if its visible in thunderbird make sure compose messages in html format is enabled in your account settings composition addressing pane compose an email in markdown for example hello world javascript alert hello syntax highlighting right click in the compose box and choose the markdown toggle item from the context menu or click the button that appears in your address bar or use the hotkey ctrl alt m by default you should see your email rendered correctly from markdown into rich html send your awesome email to everyone you know it will appear to them the same way it looks to you revert to markdown after rendering your markdown to pretty html you can still get back to your original markdown just right click anywhere in the newly rendered markdown and click markdown toggle your email compose body will change back to the markdown you had written note that any changes you make to the pretty html will be lost when you revert to markdown in gmail you can also use the browsers undo command ctrl z cmd z or from the edit menu be warned that you might also lose the last few characters you entered replies in gmail thunderbird and google groups you can use markdown toggle normally just write your reply top bottom inline wherever and then convert the original email that youre replying to will be left alone technically existing blockquote blocks will be left intact in hotmail and yahoo which dont put the original in a blockquote and optionally in gmail thunderbird and google groups you can ensure that only the part of the reply that you wrote gets converted by selecting what you want to convert and then clicking markdown toggle see the next section selection piecemeal conversion sometimes you dont want to convert the entire email sometimes your email isnt entirely markdown to convert only part of the email select the text with your mouse or keyboard right click on it and click the markdown toggle menu item your selection is magically rendered into pretty html to revert back to markdown just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text right click and click the markdown toggle menu item again now its magically back to the original markdown things to know about converting reverting a selection if you select only part of a block of text only that text will be converted the converted block will be wrapped in a paragraph element so the original line will be broken up you probably dont want to ever do this you can select and revert multiple converted blocks at the same time one upshot of this is that you can select your entire email click markdown toggle and all portions of it that you had converted will be reverted if you dont have anything selected when you click markdown toggle markdown here will check if there are converted blocks anywhere in the message and revert them if there no converted blocks are found it will convert the entire email options the markdown here options page can be accessed via the chrome firefox safari or thunderbird extensions list the available options include styling modifications for the rendered markdown syntax highlighting theme selection and modification tex math formulae processing enabling and customization what the hotkey should be for chrome and firefox any changes made in the markdown here options are automatically synchronized between your other installations of that browser if you have the sync feature enabled in the browser troubleshooting see the troubleshooting wiki page compatibility see the compatibility wiki page notes and miscellaneous markdown here uses github flavored markdown with the limitation that gfm special links are not supported issue 11 nor will they be as mdh is not github specific available languages for syntax highlighting and the way they should be written in the fenced code block can be seen on the highlight js demo page images embedded inline in your markdown will be retained when you markdown toggle gmail allows you to put images inline in your email this can be much easier than referencing an external image email signatures are automatically excluded from conversion specifically anything after the semi standard note the trailing space is left alone note that hotmail and yahoo do not automatically add the to signatures so you have to add it yourself the markdown toggle menu item shows up for more element types than it can correctly render this is intended to help people realize that theyre not using a rich editor otherwise they just dont see the menu item and dont know why styling the use of browser specific styles moz webkit should be avoided if used they may not render correctly for people reading the email in a different browser from the one where the email was sent the use of state dependent styles like a hover dont work because they dont match at the time the styles are made explicit in email styles must be explicitly applied to all elements stylesheets get stripped for more tweaky features visit the tips and tricks section building the extension bundles building is really just zipping create all archives relative to the src directory before zipping delete the src common test directory this will prevent the autotests from ending up in the release an important preparatory step is to remove any system generated hidden files that shouldnt be included in the release file like windows desktop ini and os xs ds store etc this shell command will delete those unwanted files find name desktop ini or name and not name and not name git print0 xargs 0 rm rf chrome and opera extension create a file with a zip extension containing these files and directories manifest json common chrome firefox thunderbird extension create a file with a xpi extension containing these files and directories chrome manifest install rdf common firefox safari extension the browser specific code is located in the markdown here safari project use the safari extension builder next
