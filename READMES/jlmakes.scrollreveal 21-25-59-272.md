3 3kb minified and gzipped no dependencies from the of jlmakes 1 getting started 1 1 installation the simplest method is to copy paste this snippet just before your closing body tag html script src https unpkg com scrollreveal dist scrollreveal min js script but you can also download zip npm install scrollreveal bower install scrollreveal 1 2 the basics the reveal method is the primary api and makes it easy to create and manage various types of animations html html div class foo foo div div class bar bar div js javascript window sr scrollreveal sr reveal foo sr reveal bar 2 configuration passing a configuration object to scrollreveal changes the defaults for all reveals and passing reveal a configuration object customizes that reveal set further 2 1 practical example js changing the defaults window sr scrollreveal reset true customizing a reveal set sr reveal foo duration 200 2 2 the starting defaults js bottom left top right origin bottom can be any valid css distance e g 5rem 10 20vw etc distance 20px time in milliseconds duration 500 delay 0 starting angles in degrees will transition from these values to 0 in all axes rotate x 0 y 0 z 0 starting opacity value before transitioning to the computed opacity opacity 0 starting scale value will transition from this value to 1 scale 0 9 accepts any valid css easing e g ease ease in out linear etc easing cubic bezier 0 6 0 2 0 1 1 html is the default reveal container you can pass either dom node e g document queryselector foocontainer selector e g foocontainer container window document documentelement true false to control reveal animations on mobile mobile true true reveals occur every time elements become visible false reveals occur once as elements become visible reset false always — delay for all reveal animations once — delay only the first time reveals occur onload delay only for animations triggered by first load usedelay always change when an element is considered in the viewport the default value of 0 20 means 20 of an element must be visible for its reveal to occur viewfactor 0 2 pixel values that alter the container boundaries e g set top 48 if you have a 48px tall fixed toolbar visual

function domel callbacks that fire for each completed element reveal and reset afterreveal function domel afterreset function domel 3 advanced 3 1 sequenced animations you can pass a sequence interval in milliseconds to the reveal method making sequenced animations a breeze note the interval is the time until the next element in the sequence begins its reveal which is separate from the time until the elements animation completes in this example the animation duration is 2 seconds but the sequence interval is 50 milliseconds js interval passed to reveal window sr scrollreveal duration 2000 sr reveal box 50 or interval and custom config passed to reveal window sr scrollreveal sr reveal box duration 2000 50 3 2 working with dom nodes you may also pass node nodelist and array node as the reveal target js var node document queryselector foo var nodelist document queryselectorall bar var array array prototype slice call nodelist sr reveal node sr reveal nodelist sr reveal array 3 3 custom multiple containers the default container is the viewport but you can assign any container to any reveal set tip scrollreveal works just as well with horizontally scrolling containers too html foo 1 foo 2 foo 3 bar 1 bar 2 bar 3 js window sr scrollreveal as a dom node var foocontainer document getelementbyid foocontainer sr reveal foo container foocontainer as a selector sr reveal bar container barcontainer 3 4 asynchronous content the sync method updates asynchronously loaded content with any existing reveal sets example html index html foo foo foo ajax html foo async foo async foo async js var foocontainer content sr xmlhttp foocontainer document getelementbyid foocontainer sr scrollreveal sr reveal foo container foocontainer setup a new asynchronous request xmlhttp new xmlhttprequest xmlhttp onreadystatechange function if xmlhttp readystate xmlhttprequest done if xmlhttp status 200 turn our response into html var content document createelement div content innerhtml xmlhttp responsetext content content childnodes add each element to the dom for var i 0 i content length i foocontainer appendchild content i finally sr sync xmlhttp open get ajax html true xmlhttp send 4 tips 4 1 order matters its important that reveal calls be made as close to last in your page as possible so that elements on the page have loaded any other 3rd party libraries have had a chance to run any other styles added to your elements wont be overwritten example html doctype html load and instantiate scrollreveal first window sr scrollreveal div class foocontainer div class fooreveal foo div div class fooreveal foo div div class fooreveal foo div div make reveal calls last script sr reveal fooreveal container foocontainer script 4 2 improve user experience in most cases your elements will start at opacity 0 so they can fade in however since javascript loads after the page begins rendering you might see your elements flickering as they begin rendering before being hidden by scrollreveals javascript the ideal solution is to set your reveal elements visibility to hidden in the head of your page to ensure they render hidden while your javascript loads continuing our example from 4 1 html doctype html load and instantiate scrollreveal first window sr scrollreveal p pre code add class to lt html gt if scrollreveal is supported note this method is deprecated and only works in version 3 if sr issupported document documentelement classlist add sr lt script gt lt style gt ensure elements load hidden before scrollreveal runs sr fooreveal visibility hidden lt style gt code pre p head body p pre code lt div class foocontainer gt lt div class fooreveal gt foo lt div gt lt div class fooreveal gt foo lt div gt lt div class fooreveal gt foo lt div gt lt div gt lt make reveal calls last gt lt script gt sr reveal fooreveal container foocontainer lt script gt code pre p body html p blockquote p strong note strong if you prefer not to put styles in the code lt head gt code of your page including this style in your primary stylesheet will still help with element flickering since your css will likely load before your javascript p blockquote h4 4 3 add perspective to 3d rotation h4 p scrollreveal supports 3d rotation out of the box but you may want to emphasize the effect by specifying a perspective property on your container p p em continuing our example from 4 2 em html lt doctype html gt html head load and instantiate scrollreveal first script src js scrollreveal min js window sr scrollreveal p pre code add class to lt html gt if scrollreveal is supported note this method is deprecated and only works in version 3 if sr issupported document documentelement classlist add sr lt script gt lt style gt ensure elements load hidden
