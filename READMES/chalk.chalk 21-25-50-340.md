terminal string styling done right see whats new in chalk 2 highlights expressive api highly performant ability to nest styles 256 truecolor color support auto detects color support doesnt extend

underline hello world chain styles and call the last one as a method with a string argument order doesnt matter and later styles take precedent in case of a conflict this simply means that chalk red yellow green is equivalent to chalk green multiple arguments will be separated by space chalk enabled color support is automatically detected as is the level see chalk level however if youd like to simply enable disable chalk you can do so via the enabled property chalk is enabled by default unless explicitly disabled via the constructor or chalk level is 0 if you need to change this in a reusable module create a new instance js const ctx new chalk constructor enabled false chalk level color support is automatically detected but you can override it by setting the level property you should however only do this in your own code as it applies globally to all chalk consumers if you need to change this in a reusable module create a new instance js const ctx new chalk constructor level 0 levels are as follows all colors disabled basic color support 16 colors 256 color support truecolor support 16 million colors chalk supportscolor detect whether the terminal supports color used internally and handled for you but exposed for convenience can be overridden by the user with the flags color and no color for situations where using color is not possible add the environment variable force color 1 to forcefully enable color or force color 0 to forcefully disable the use of force color overrides all other color support checks explicit 256 truecolor mode can be enabled using the color 256 and color 16m flags respectively styles modifiers reset bold dim italic not widely supported underline inverse hidden strikethrough not widely supported visible text is emitted

console log chalkthere are bold 5280 feet in a mile in bold miles miles there are green bold calculatefeet miles feet blocks are delimited by an opening curly brace a style some content and a closing curly brace template styles are chained exactly like normal chalk styles the following two statements are equivalent js console log chalk bold rgb 10 100 200 hello console log chalk bold rgb 10 100 200 hello note that function styles rgb hsl keyword etc may not contain spaces between parameters all interpolated values chalk foo are converted to strings via the tostring method all curly braces and in interpolated value strings are escaped 256 and truecolor color support chalk supports 256 colors and truecolor 16 million colors on supported terminal apps colors are downsampled from 16 million rgb values to an ansi color format that is supported by the terminal emulator or by specifying level n as a chalk option for example chalk configured to run at level 1 basic color support will downsample an rgb value of ff0000 red to 31 ansi escape for red examples chalk hex deaded underline hello world chalk keyword orange some orange text chalk rgb 15 100 204 inverse hello background

like extending string prototype which causes all kinds of problems and the package is unmaintained although there are other packages they either do too much or not enough chalk is a clean and focused alternative related chalk cli cli for this module ansi styles ansi escape codes for styling strings in the terminal supports color detect whether a terminal supports color strip ansi strip ansi escape codes strip ansi stream strip ansi escape codes from a stream has ansi check if a string has ansi escape codes ansi regex regular expression for matching ansi escape codes wrap ansi wordwrap a string with ansi escape codes slice ansi slice a string with ansi escape codes color convert converts colors between different models chalk animation animate strings in the terminal gradient string apply color gradients to strings chalk pipe create chalk style schemes with simpler style strings terminal link create clickable links in the terminal maintainers sindre sorhus josh junon license mit
