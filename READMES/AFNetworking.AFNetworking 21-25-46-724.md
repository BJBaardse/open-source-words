afnetworking is a delightful networking library for ios macos watchos and tvos its built on top of the foundation url loading system extending the powerful high level networking abstractions built into cocoa it has a modular architecture with well designed feature rich apis that are a joy to use perhaps the most important feature of all however is the amazing community of developers who use and contribute to afnetworking every day afnetworking powers some of the most popular and critically acclaimed apps on the iphone ipad and mac choose afnetworking for your next project or migrate over your existing projectsâ€”youll be happy you did how to get started download afnetworking and try out the included mac and iphone example apps read the getting started guide faq or other articles on the wiki check out the documentation for a comprehensive look at all of the apis available in afnetworking read the afnetworking 3 0 migration guide for an overview of the architectural changes from 2

issue if you have a feature request open an issue if you want to contribute submit a pull request installation afnetworking supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project installation with cocoapods cocoapods is a dependency manager for objective c which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd party libraries like afnetworking in your projects see the getting started guide for more information you can install it with the following command bash gem install cocoapods cocoapods 0 39 0 is required to build afnetworking 3 0 0 podfile to integrate afnetworking into your xcode project using cocoapods specify it in your podfile ruby source https github com cocoapods specs git platform ios 8 0 target targetname do pod afnetworking 3 0 end then run the following command bash pod install installation with carthage carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks you can install carthage with homebrew using the following command bash brew update brew install carthage to integrate afnetworking into your xcode project using carthage specify it in your cartfile ogdl github afnetworking afnetworking 3 0 run carthage to build the framework and drag the built afnetworking framework into your xcode project requirements afnetworking version minimum ios target minimum macos

do not use reachability to determine if the original request should be sent you should try to send it you can use reachability to determine when a request should be automatically retried although it may still fail a reachability notification that the connectivity is available is a good time to retry something network reachability is a useful tool for determining why a request might have failed after a network request has failed telling the user theyre offline is better than giving them a more technical but accurate error such as request timed out see also wwdc 2012 session 706 networking
