overview microsoft provides virtual machine disk images to facilitate website testing in multiple versions of ie regardless of the host operating system with a single command you can have ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 ie11 and msedge running in separate virtual machines quickstart just paste this into a terminal curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh bash requirements virtualbox 5 0 http virtualbox org select command line utilities during installation curl ubuntu sudo apt get install curl linux only unar ubuntu sudo apt get install unar patience note use ievms version 0 2 1 for virtualbox 5 0 installation 1 install virtualbox and check the requirements 2 download and unpack ievms to install ie versions 6 7 8 9 10 11 and edge use curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh bash to install specific ie versions ie7 ie9 and edge only for example use curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh env ievms versions 7 9 edge bash 3 launch virtual box 4 choose ievms image from virtual box the ova images are massive and can take hours or tens of minutes to download depending on the speed of your internet connection you might want to start the install and then go catch a movie or maybe dinner or both recovering from a failed installation each version is installed into ievms or install path if the installation fails for any reason corrupted download for instance delete the appropriate zip ova file and rerun the install if nothing else you can delete ievms or install path and rerun the install specifying the install path to specify where the vms are installed use the install path variable curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh env install path path to ievms bash passing additional options to curl the curl command is passed any options present in the curl opts environment variable for example you can set a download speed limit curl s https raw

download roughly 12 5g of data note reusing the xp vm for ie7 and ie8 the default saves an incredible amount of space and bandwidth if it is disabled reuse xp no the disk space required climbs to 95g 49g if cleaned post install and around 22g will be downloaded reusing the win7 vm on the other hand also the default saves tons of bandwidth but pretty much breaks even on disk space disable it with reuse win7 no features clean snapshot a snapshot is automatically taken upon install allowing rollback to the pristine virtual environment configuration anything can go wrong in windows and rather than having to worry about maintaining a stable vm you can simply revert to the clean snapshot to reset your vm to the initial state guest control virtualbox guest additions are installed after each virtual machine is created and before the clean snapshot and the appropriate steps are taken to enable guest control from the host machine resuming downloads if one of the comically large files fails to download the curl command used will automatically attempt to resume where it left off unfortunately the modern ie download servers do not support resume reusing xp vms ie7 and ie8 ship from ms on vista and win7 respectively both of these images are far larger than the ie6 xp image which also technically supports ie7 and ie8 to save bandwidth space and time ievms will reuse duplicate the ie6 xp vm image for both virtualbox guest control is used to run the appropriate ie installer within the vm the clean snapshot includes the updated browser version note if youd like to disable xp vm reuse for ie7 and ie8 set the environment variable reuse xp to anything other than yes curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh env reuse xp no bash reusing win7 vms currently there exists a bug in virtualbox or possibly elsewhere that disables guest control after a windows 8 virtual machines state is saved to better support guest control and to eliminate yet another image download ievms will re use the ie9 win7 image for ie10 and ie11 by default in addition the win7 vms are the only ones which can be successfully rearmed to extend the activation period note if youd like to disable win7 vm reuse for ie10 set the environment variable reuse win7 to anything other than yes curl s https raw githubusercontent com xdissent ievms master ievms sh reuse win7 no bash note it is currently impossible to install ie11 without reusing the win7 virtual machine control iso microsofts xp image uses a blank password for the ieuser which disallows control via virtualboxs guest control by default changing a value in the windows registry enables guest control but requires accessing the vms hard drive a solution is to boot the vm with a special boot cd image which attaches the hard disk and edits the registry a custom linux build has been created based on the ntpasswd bootdisk which makes the required registry edits and simply powers off the machine the ievms script may then use virtualbox guest controls to manage the vm the control iso is built within a vagrant ubuntu vm if youd like to build it yourself clone the ievms repository install vagrant and run vagrant up the base ntpasswd boot disk will be downloaded unpacked and customized within the vagrant vm a custom linux kernel is cross compiled for the image as well acknowledgements modern ie provider of ie vm images ntpasswd boot disk starting point and registry editor regit config minimal virtualbox kernel config reference uck used to re master control iso license none to quote morrissey take it its yours
