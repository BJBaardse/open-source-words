javascript standard style english • español latinoamérica • italiano italian • 한국어 korean • português brasil • 简体中文 simplified chinese • 繁體中文 taiwanese mandarin sponsored by javascript style guide linter and formatter this module saves you and others time in three ways no configuration the easiest way to enforce consistent style in your project just drop it in automatically format code just run standard fix and say goodbye to messy or inconsistent code catch style issues programmer errors early save precious code review time by eliminating back and forth between reviewer contributor no decisions to make no eslintrc jshintrc or jscsrc files to manage it just works install with npm install standard save dev open source supporters standardjs — the rules 2 spaces – for indentation single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping no unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs no semicolons – its fine really more details space after keywords if condition space after function name function name arg always use instead of – but obj null is allowed to check null undefined always handle the node js err function parameter declare browser globals with global comment at top of file prevents accidental use of vaguely named browser globals like open length event and name example global alert prompt exceptions are window document and navigator and more goodness – give standard a try today to get a better idea take a look at a sample file written in javascript standard style or check out one of the thousands of projects that use standard table of contents quick start install usage what you might do if youre clever faq why should i use javascript standard style who uses javascript standard style are there text editor plugins is there a readme badge i disagree with rule x can you change it but this isnt a real web standard is there an automatic formatter how do i ignore files how do i hide a certain warning i use a library that pollutes the global namespace how do i prevent variable is not defined errors how do i use experimental javascript es next features can i use a javascript language variant like flow or typescript what about mocha jasmine qunit etc what about web workers can i check code inside of markdown or html files is there a git pre commit hook how do i make the output all colorful and pretty is there a node js api how do i contribute to standard license install the easiest way to use javascript standard style is to install it globally as a node command line program run the following command in terminal bash npm install standard global or you can install standard locally for use in a single project bash npm install standard save dev note to run the preceding commands node js and npm must be installed usage after youve installed standard you should be able to use the standard program the simplest use case would be checking the style of all javascript files in the current working directory bash standard error use javascript standard style lib torrent js 950 11 expected and instead saw you can optionally pass in a directory or directories using the glob pattern be sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by standard instead of your shell bash standard src util js test js note by default standard will look for all files matching the patterns js jsx what you might do if youre clever add it to package json json name my cool package devdependencies standard scripts test standard node my tests js style is checked automatically when you run npm test bash npm test error use javascript standard style lib torrent js 950 11 expected and instead saw never give style feedback on a pull request again why should i use javascript standard style the beauty of javascript standard style is that its simple no one wants to maintain multiple hundred line style configuration files for every module project they work on enough of this madness this module saves you and others time in three ways no configuration the easiest way to enforce consistent style in your project just drop it in automatically format code just run standard fix and say goodbye to messy or inconsistent code catch style issues programmer errors early save precious code review time by eliminating back and forth between reviewer contributor adopting standard style means ranking the importance of code clarity and community conventions higher than personal style this might not make sense for 100 of projects and development cultures however open source can be a hostile place for newbies setting up clear automated contributor expectations makes a project healthier for more info see the conference talk write perfect code with standard and eslint in this talk youll learn about linting when to use standard versus eslint and how prettier compares to standard who uses javascript standard style lots of folks in addition to companies many community members use standard on packages that are too numerous to list here standard is also the top starred linter in githubs clean code linter showcase are there text editor plugins first install standard then install the appropriate plugin for your editor sublime text using package control install sublimelinter and sublimelinter contrib standard for automatic formatting on save install standardformat atom install linter js standard alternatively you can install linter js standard engine instead of bundling a version of standard it will automatically use the version installed in your current project it will also work out of the box with other linters based on standard engine for automatic formatting install standard formatter for snippets install standardjs snippets visual studio code install vscode standardjs includes support for automatic formatting for js snippets install vscode standardjs snippets for react snippets install vscode react standard vim install ale and add these lines to your vimrc file vim let g ale linters \ javascript standard \ this sets standard as your only linter for javascript files and so prevents conflicts with eslint for automatic formatting on save add these lines to vimrc vim autocmd bufwritepost js silent standard fix set autoread alternative plugins to consider include neomake and syntastic both of which have built in support for standard though configuration may be necessary emacs install flycheck and check out the manual to learn how to enable it in your projects brackets search the extension registry for standard code style and click install webstorm phpstorm intellij rubymine jetbrains etc webstorm recently announced native support for standard directly in the ide if you still prefer to configure standard manually follow this guide this applies to all jetbrains products including phpstorm intellij rubymine etc is there a readme badge yes if you use standard in your project you can include one of these badges in your readme to let people know that your code is using the standard style md javascript style guide https cdn rawgit com standard standard master badge svg https github com standard standard md javascript style guide https img shields io badge code style standard brightgreen svg https standardjs com i disagree with rule x can you change it no the whole point of standard is to save you time by avoiding bikeshedding about code style there are lots of debates online about tabs vs spaces etc that will never be resolved these debates just distract from getting stuff done at the end of the day you have to just pick something and thats the whole philosophy of standard its a bunch of sensible just pick something opinions hopefully users see the value in that over defending their own opinions if you really want to configure hundreds of eslint rules individually you can always use eslint directly with eslint config standard to layer your changes on top standard eject can help you migrate from standard to eslint and eslint config standard pro tip just use standard and move on there are actual real problems that you could spend your time solving p but this isnt a real web standard of course its not the style laid out here is not affiliated with any official web standards groups which is why this repo is called standard standard and not ecma standard the word standard has more meanings than just web standard for example this module helps hold our code to a high standard of quality this module ensures that new contributors follow some basic style standards is there an automatic formatter yes you can use standard fix to fix most issues automatically standard fix is built into standard for maximum convenience most problems are fixable but some errors like forgetting to handle errors must be fixed manually to save you time standard outputs the message run standard fix to automatically fix some problems when it detects problems that can be fixed automatically how do i ignore files certain paths node modules coverage vendor min js bundle js and files folders that begin with like git are automatically ignored paths in a projects root gitignore file are also automatically ignored sometimes you need to ignore additional folders or specific minified files to do that add a standard ignore property to package json json standard ignore out lib select2 lib ckeditor tmp js how do i hide a certain warning in rare cases youll need to break a rule and hide the warning generated by standard javascript standard style uses eslint under the hood and you can hide warnings as you normally would if you used eslint directly to get verbose output so you can find the particular rule name to ignore run bash standard verbose error use javascript standard style routes error js 20 36 file was used before it was defined no use before define disable all rules on a specific line js file i know what i am doing eslint disable line or disable only the no use before define rule js file i know what i am doing eslint disable line no use before define or disable the no use before define rule for multiple lines js eslint disable no use before define console log offending code goes here console log offending code goes here console log offending code goes here eslint enable no use before define i use a library that pollutes the global namespace how do i prevent variable is not defined errors some packages e g mocha put their functions e g describe it on the global object poor form since these functions are not defined or required anywhere in your code standard will warn that youre using a variable that is not defined usually this rule is really useful for catching typos but we want to disable it for these global variables to let standard as well as humans reading your code know that certain variables are global in your code add this to the top of your file js global myvar1 myvar2 if you have hundreds of files it may be desirable to avoid adding comments to every file in this case run bash standard global myvar1 global myvar2 or add this to package json json standard globals myvar1 myvar2 note global and globals are equivalent how do i use experimental javascript es next features standard supports the latest ecmascript features es8 es2017 including language feature proposals that are in stage 4 of the proposal process to support experimental language features standard supports specifying a custom javascript parser before using a custom parser consider whether the added complexity is worth it to use a custom parser first install it from npm bash npm install babel eslint save dev then run bash standard parser babel eslint or add this to package json json standard parser babel eslint if standard is installed globally i e npm install standard global then be sure to install babel eslint globally as well with npm install babel eslint global can i use a javascript language variant like flow or typescript standard supports the latest ecmascript features however flow and typescript add new syntax to the language so they are not supported out of the box to support javascript language variants standard supports specifying a custom javascript parser as well as an eslint plugin to handle the changed syntax before using a javascript language variant consider whether the added complexity is worth it flow to use flow you need to run standard with babel eslint as the parser and eslint plugin flowtype as a plugin bash npm install babel eslint eslint plugin flowtype save dev then run bash standard parser babel eslint plugin flowtype or add this to package json json standard parser babel eslint plugins flowtype note plugin and plugins are equivalent if standard is installed globally i e npm install standard global then be sure to install babel eslint and eslint plugin flowtype globally as well with npm install babel eslint eslint plugin flowtype global typescript to use typescript you need to run standard with typescript eslint parser as the parser eslint plugin typescript as a plugin and tell standard to lint ts files since it doesnt by default bash npm install typescript eslint parser eslint plugin typescript save dev then run bash standard parser typescript eslint parser plugin typescript ts or add this to package json json standard parser typescript eslint parser plugins typescript with that in package json you can run bash standard ts if standard is installed globally i e npm install standard global then be sure to install typescript eslint parser and eslint plugin typescript globally as well with npm install typescript eslint parser eslint plugin typescript global what about mocha jasmine qunit etc to support mocha in test files add this to the top of the test files js eslint env mocha or run bash standard env mocha where mocha can be one of jasmine qunit phantomjs and so on to see a full list check eslints specifying environments documentation for a list of what globals are available for these environments check the globals npm module note env and envs are equivalent what about web workers and service workers add this to the top of web worker files js eslint env worker this lets standard as well as humans reading the code know that self is a global in web worker code for service workers add this instead js eslint env serviceworker can i check code inside of markdown or html files to check code inside markdown files use standard markdown alternatively there are eslint plugins that can check code inside markdown html and many other types of language files to check code inside markdown files use an eslint plugin bash npm install eslint plugin markdown then to check js that appears inside code blocks run bash standard plugin markdown md to check code inside html files use an eslint plugin bash npm install eslint plugin html then to check js that appears inside script tags run bash standard plugin html html is there a git pre commit hook funny you should ask bash bin bash ensure all javascript files staged for commit pass standard code style function xargs r portable version of xargs r the r flag is a gnu extension that prevents xargs from running if there are no input files if ifs read r d \n path then echo path cat xargs fi git diff name only cached relative grep jsx\ sed s alnum \ g xargs r e t standard if ne 0 then echo javascript standard style errors were detected aborting commit exit 1 fi how do i make the output all colorful and pretty the built in output is simple and straightforward but if you like shiny things install snazzy bash npm install snazzy and run bash standard verbose snazzy theres also standard tap standard json standard reporter and standard summary is there a node js api yes standard linttext text opts callback lint the provided source text an opts object may be provided js cwd current working directory default process cwd filename path of the file containing the text being linted optional though some eslint plugins require it fix false automatically fix problems globals custom global variables to declare plugins custom eslint plugins envs custom eslint environment parser custom js parser e g babel eslint additional options may be loaded from a package json if its found for the current working directory the callback will be called with an error and results object the results object will contain the following properties js var

globals global variables to declare plugins eslint plugins envs eslint environment parser js parser e g babel eslint the callback will be called with an error and results object same as above how do i contribute to standard contributions are welcome check out the issues or the prs and make your own if you want something that you dont see there want to chat join contributors on irc in the standard channel on freenode here are some important packages in the standard ecosystem standard this repo standard engine cli engine for arbitrary eslint rules eslint config standard eslint rules for standard eslint config standard jsx eslint rules for standard jsx eslint plugin standard custom eslint rules for standard not part of eslint core eslint the linter that powers standard snazzy pretty terminal output for standard standard www code for https standardjs com semistandard standard with semicolons if you must there are also many editor plugins a list of npm packages that use standard and an awesome list of packages in the standard ecosystem license mit copyright c feross aboukhadijeh
