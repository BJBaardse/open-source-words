uitextfield uitextview with iqkeyboardmanager then youre totally going on wrong way i would never suggest to add iqkeyboardmanager as dependency adding shipping with any third party library instead of adding iqkeyboardmanager you should implement your own solution to achieve same kind of results iqkeyboardmanager is totally designed for projects to help developers for their convenience its not designed for adding dependency shipping with any third party library because doing this could block adoption by other developers for their projects as well who are not using iqkeyboardmanager and implemented their custom solution to handle uitextfield uitextview thought the project if iqkeyboardmanager conflicts with other third party library then its developer responsibility to enable disable iqkeyboardmanager when presenting dismissing third party library ui third party libraries are not responsible to handle iqkeyboardmanager requirements platform ios https img shields io badge platform
