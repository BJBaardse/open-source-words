logstash logstash is part of the elastic stack along with beats elasticsearch and kibana logstash is a server side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously transforms it and then sends it to your favorite stash ours is elasticsearch naturally logstash has over 200 plugins and you can write your own very easily as well for more info see https www elastic co products logstash documentation and getting started you can find the documentation and getting started guides for logstash on the elastic co site for information about building the documentation see the readme in https github com elastic docs downloads you can download officially released logstash binaries as well as debian rpm packages for the supported platforms from downloads page snapshot builds for the daring snapshot builds are available these builds are created nightly and have undergone no formal qa so they should never be run in production complete with x pack apache 2 0 licensed

support logstash plugins logstash plugins are hosted in separate repositories under the logstash plugins github organization each plugin is a self contained ruby gem which gets published to rubygems org writing your own plugin logstash is known for its extensibility there are hundreds of plugins for logstash and you can write your own very easily for more info on developing and testing these plugins please see the working with plugins section plugin issues and pull requests please open new issues and pull requests for plugins under its own repository for example if you have to report an issue enhancement for the elasticsearch output please do so here logstash core will continue to exist under this repository and all related issues and pull requests can be submitted here developing logstash core prerequisites install jdk version 8 make sure to set the java home environment variable to the path to your jdk installation directory for example set java home jdk path install jruby 9 1 x it is recommended to use a ruby version manager such as rvm or rbenv install rake and bundler tool using gem install rake and gem install bundler respectively rvm install optional if you prefer to use rvm ruby version manager to manage ruby versions on your machine follow these directions in the logstash folder sh gpg keyserver hkp keys gnupg net recv keys

version should be the same as in the ruby version file building logstash the logstash project includes the source code for all of logstash including the elastic licensed x pack features and functions to run logstash from source using only the oss licensed code export the oss environment variable with a value of true sh export oss true to run logstash from the repo you must first bootstrap the environment sh rake bootstrap you can then use bin logstash to start logstash but there are no plugins installed to install default plugins you can run sh rake plugin install default this will install the 80 default plugins which makes logstash ready to connect to multiple data sources perform transformations and send the results to elasticsearch and other destinations to verify your environment run the following to send your first event sh bin logstash e input stdin output stdout this should start logstash with stdin input waiting for you to enter an event sh hello world 2016 11 11t01 22 14 405 0000 0 0 0 0 hello world advanced drip launcher drip is a tool that solves the slow jvm startup problem while developing logstash the drip script is intended to be a drop in replacement for the java command we recommend using drip during development in particular for running tests using drip the first invocation of a command will not be faster but the subsequent commands will be swift to tell logstash to use drip set the environment variable javacmd which drip example but see the testing section below before running rspec for the first time javacmd which drip bin rspec caveats drip does not work with stdin you cannot use drip for running configs which use the stdin plugin building logstash documentation to build the logstash reference open source content only on your local machine clone the following repos logstash contains main docs about core features logstash docs contains generated plugin docs docs contains doc build files make sure you have the same branch checked out in logstash and logstash docs check out master in the docs repo run the doc build script from within the docs repo for example build docs pl doc logstash docs index asciidoc chunk 1 open testing most of the unit tests in logstash are written using rspec for the ruby parts for the java parts we use junit for testing you can use the test rake tasks and the bin rspec command see instructions below core tests 1 to run the core tests you can use the gradle task gradlew test or use the rspec tool to run all tests or run a specific test bin rspec bin rspec spec foo bar spec rb note that before running the rspec command for the first time you need to set up the rspec test dependencies by running gradlew bootstrap 2 to run the subset of tests covering the java codebase only run gradlew javatests 3 to execute the complete test suite including the integration tests run gradlew check sometimes you might find a change to a piece of logstash code causes a test to hang these can be hard to debug if you set ls java opts agentlib jdwp transport dt socket server y suspend n address 5005 you can connect to a running logstash with your ides debugger which can be a great way of finding the issue plugins tests to run the tests of all currently installed plugins rake test plugin you can install the default set of plugins included in the logstash package rake test install default note that if a plugin is installed using the plugin manager bin logstash plugin install do not forget to also install the plugins development dependencies using the following command after the plugin installation bin logstash plugin install development building artifacts built artifacts will be placed in the ls home build directory and will create the directory if it is not already present you can build a logstash snapshot package as tarball or zip file sh gradlew assembletardistribution gradlew assemblezipdistribution oss only artifacts can similarly be built with their own gradle tasks sh gradlew assembleosstardistribution gradlew assembleosszipdistribution you can also build rpm and deb but the fpm tool is required sh rake artifact rpm rake artifact deb and sh rake artifact rpm oss rake artifact deb oss using a custom jruby distribution if you want the build to use a custom jruby you can do so by setting a path to a custom jruby distributions source root via the custom jruby path gradle property e g sh gradlew clean test pcustom jruby path path to jruby project principles community if a newbie has a bad time its a bug software make it work then make it right then make it

on a napkin programming is not a required skill whatever youve seen about open source and maintainers or community members saying send patches or die you will not see that here it is more important to
