dive into machine learning hi there this guide is for you youre new to machine learning you know python at least the basics if you want to learn more python try this i learned python by hacking first and getting serious later i wanted to do this with machine learning if this is your style join me in getting a bit ahead of yourself note there are several fields within data and machine learning is just one its good to know the context what is the difference between data analytics data analysis data mining data science machine learning and big data get your feet wet i suggest you get your feet wet asap youll boost your confidence tools youll need python python 3 is the best option ipython and the jupyter notebook fka ipython and ipython notebook some scientific computing packages numpy pandas scikit learn matplotlib you can install python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with the anaconda python distribution anaconda is popular in data science and machine learning communities if youre using python 2 7 dont worry you dont have to migrate to python 3 just for this guide also if youre using pip virtualenv instead of anaconda thats alright too and re installing packages this is a helpful doc conda vs pip vs virtualenv lets go learn how to use ipython notebook 5 10 minutes you can learn by screencast instead now follow along with this brief exercise 10 minutes an introduction to machine learning with scikit learn do it in ipython or ipython notebook itll really boost your confidence what just happened you just classified some hand written digits using scikit learn neat huh scikit learn is the go to library for machine learning in python its used widely machine learning is hard youll be glad your tools are easy to work with i encourage you to look at the scikit learn homepage and spend about 5 minutes looking over the names of the strategies classification regression etc and their applications dont click through yet just get a glimpse of the vocabulary dive in a visual introduction to machine learning lets learn a bit more about machine learning and a couple of common ideas and concerns read a visual introduction to machine learning part 1 by stephanie yee and tony chu it wont take long its a beautiful introduction try not to drool too much a few useful things to know about machine learning ok lets dive deeper read a few useful things to know about machine learning by prof pedro domingos its densely packed with valuable information but not opaque the author understands that theres a lot of black art and folk wisdom and they invite you in take your time with this one take notes dont worry if you dont understand it all yet the whole paper is packed with value but i want to call out two points data alone is not enough this is where science meets art in machine learning quoting domingos the need for knowledge in learning should not be surprising machine learning is not magic it cant get something from nothing what it does is get more from less programming like all engineering is a lot of work we have to build everything from scratch learning is more like farming which lets nature do most of the work farmers combine seeds with nutrients to grow crops learners combine knowledge with data to grow programs more data beats a cleverer algorithm listen up programmers we like cool tools resist the temptation to reinvent the wheel or to over engineer solutions your starting point is to do the simplest thing that could possibly work quoting domingos suppose youve constructed the best set of features you can but the classifiers youre getting are still not accurate enough what can you do now there are two main choices design a better learning algorithm or gather more data as a rule of thumb a dumb algorithm with lots and lots of data beats a clever one with modest amounts of it after all machine learning is all about letting data do the heavy lifting when you work on a real machine learning problem you should focus your efforts on your domain knowledge and data before optimizing your choice of algorithms prefer to do simple things until you have to increase complexity you should not rush into neural networks because you think theyre cool to improve your model get more data then use your knowledge of the problem to explore and process the data you should only optimize the choice of algorithms after you have gathered enough data and youve processed it well chart inspired by a slide from alex pintos talk secure because math a deep dive on ml based monitoring just about time for a break before you take a break grab some podcasts first download an interview with prof domingos on the data skeptic podcast 2018 prof domingos wrote the paper we read earlier you might also start

from the bayesian machine learning overview on metacademy bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the past 20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in building structured models of real world phenomena algorithmic advances and increasing computational resources have made it possible to fit rich highly structured models which were previously considered intractable you can learn more by studying one of the following resources both resources use python pymc and jupyter notebooks the free book probabilistic programming and bayesian methods for hackers made with a computation understanding first mathematics second point of view its available in print too bayesian modelling in python risks machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data pedro domingos in a few useful things to know about machine learning the programs you generate will require maintenance like any way of creating programs faster you can rack up technical debt here is the abstract of machine learning the high interest credit card of technical debt machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly this paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free using the framework of technical debt we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning the goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible these include boundary erosion entanglement hidden feedback loops undeclared consumers data dependencies changes in the external world and a variety of system level anti patterns if youre following this guide you should read that paper you can also listen to a podcast episode interviewing one of the authors of this paper a few more articles on the challenges running ml powered systems in production rules of machine learning best practices for reliable ml engineering by martin zinkevich regarding ml engineering practices and patterns in production at google optional accompanying video whats your ml test score a rubric for ml production systems by eric breck shanqing cai eric nielsen michael salib d sculley google surviving data science at the speed of hype by john foreman data scientist at mailchimp the high cost of maintaining machine learning systems 11 clever methods of overfitting and how to avoid them the perilous world of machine learning for fun and profit pipeline jungles and hidden feedback loops welcome to the danger zone so you are dabbling with machine learning youve got hacking skills maybe youve got some knowledge in domingos sense some substantive expertise or domain knowledge this diagram is modified slightly from drew conways data science venn diagram it isnt a perfect fit for us but it may get the point across please dont sell yourself as a machine learning expert while youre still in the danger zone dont build bad products or publish junk science also please dont be evil this guide cant tell you how youll know youve made it into machine learning competence let alone expertise its hard to evaluate proficiency without schools or other institutions this is a common problem for self taught people towards expertise you need practice on hacker news user olympus commented to say you could use competitions to practice and evaluate yourself kaggle and chalearn are hubs for machine learning competitions you can find some examples of code for popular kaggle competitions here for smaller exercises try hackerrank you also need understanding you should review what kaggle competition winners say about their solutions for example the no free hunch blog these might be over your head at first but once youre starting to understand and appreciate these you know youre getting somewhere competitions and challenges are just one way to practice you shouldnt limit yourself though and you should also understand that machine learning isnt all about kaggle competitions heres a complementary way to practice do practice studies ask a question start your own study the most important thing in data science is the question dr jeff t leek so start with a question then find real data analyze it then communicate results when you have a novel finding reach out for peer review fix issues learn share what you learn and repeat re phrasing this it fits with the scientific method formulate a question or problem statement create a hypothesis gather data analyze the data and communicate results you should watch this video about the scientific method in data science and or read this article how can you come up with interesting questions heres one way every sunday browse datasets and write down some questions also sign up for data is plural a newsletter of interesting datasets look at these datasets and write down questions stay curious when a question inspires you start a study this advice to do practice studies and learn from peer review is based on a conversation with dr randal s olson heres more advice from olson quoted with permission i think the best advice is to tell people to always present their methods clearly and to avoid over interpreting their results part of being an expert is knowing that theres rarely a clear answer especially when youre working with real data as you repeat this process your practice studies will become more scientific interesting and focused the most important part of this process is peer review ask for peer review here are some communities where you can reach out for peer review cross validated stats stackexchange com r dataisbeautiful r datascience r machinelearning hacker news news ycombinator com youll probably want to submit as show hn post to any of those and ask for feedback youll get feedback youll learn a ton as experts review your work you will learn a lot about the field youll also be practicing a crucial skill accepting critical feedback when i read the feedback on my pull requests first i repeat to myself i will not get defensive i will not get defensive i will not get defensive you may want to do that before you read reviews of your machine learning work too collaborate with domain experts machine learning can be powerful but it is not magic whenever you apply machine learning to solve a problem you are going to be working in some specific problem domain to get good results you or your team will need substantive expertise aka domain knowledge learn what you can for yourself but you should also collaborate youll have better results if you collaborate with domain experts whats a domain expert see the wikipedia entry or c2 wikis rather subjective but useful blurb bow a note about machine learning and user experience ux i couldnt say it better machine learning wont figure out what problems to solve if you arent aligned with a human need youre just going to build a very powerful system to address a very small—or perhaps nonexistent—problem quote is from the ux of ai by josh lovejoy whole article is a great read today we are surrounded by software that utilizes machine learning often the results are directly user facing and intended to enhance ux before you start working ml into every aspect of your software you should get a better understanding of ux as well as how ml and ux can relate for some cursory overview start with quora which has some interesting thoughtful discussions on the subject then if you you know a coworker or friend who works in ux take them out for coffee or lunch and pick their brain i think theyll have words of encouragement as well as caution do you know good resources on this pull requests welcome for all parts of this guide including this section by no means will that make you an expert in ux but maybe itll help you know if when to reach out for help hint almost always — ux is really tricky and you should work with experts whenever you can bow a note about machine learning and security infosec appsec there was a great blackhat webcast on this topic secure because math understanding machine learning based security products slides are here video recording is here if youre using ml to recommend some media overfitting could be harmless if youre relying on ml to protect from threats overfitting could be downright dangerous check the full presentation if you are interested in this space if you want to explore this space more deeply there is a lot of reading material in the below links security data science and machine learning guide awesome ml for cybersecurity awesome ai security awesome adversarial machine learning deep learning in early editions of this guide there was no specific deep learning section i omitted it intentionally i think it is not effective for us to jump too far ahead i also know that if you become an expert in traditional machine learning youll be capable of moving onto advanced subjects like deep learning whether or not ive put that in this guide were just trying to get you started here maybe this is a way to check your progress ask yourself does deep learning seem like magic if so take that as a sign that you arent ready to work with it professionally let the fascination motivate you to learn more i have read some argue you can learn deep learning in isolation i have read others recommend its best to master traditional machine learning first why not start with traditional machine learning and develop your reasoning and intuition there youll only have an easier time learning deep learning after that after all of it youll able to tackle all sorts of interesting problems in any case when you decide youre ready to dive into deep learning here are some helpful resources have fun with deep learning by david humphrey this is an excellent way to get ahead of yourself and hack first then you will feel excited to move onto prof andrew ngs courses on deep learning there five courses as part of the deep learning specialization on coursera these courses are part of his new venture deeplearning ai machine learning crash course from google googles fast paced practical introduction to machine learning which covers building deep neural networks with tensorflow deep learning a free book published mit press by ian goodfellow yoshua bengio and aaron courville yerevanns deep learning guide quora what are the best ways to pick up deep learning skills as an engineer — answered by greg brockman co founder cto at openai previously cto at stripe sonnet a python library built on top of tensorflow for building complex neural networks made by google deepmind build a deep learning model in 15 minutes using lore big data scaling data analysis is a familiar problem now and theres no shortage of ways to address it beware needless hype and companies selling you flashy proprietary solutions you can do it all with open source tools even if buy instead of build you may want to buy from vendors who use known good stacks no news here there are other lists of awesome machine learning tools so i wont re do all that but in the big data section i would be remiss if i didnt mention apache spark mllib is apache sparks scalable machine learning library aside from the scalability spark has great apis and whats more spark has dataframes and easy co operability with pandas berkeley has a course on scalable machine learning focusing on apache spark if you are working with data intensive applications at all ill recommend this book designing data intensive applications by martin kleppman you can start reading it online free via safari books its not specific to machine learning but you can bridge that gap yourself lastly here are some other useful links regarding big data and ml 10 things statistics taught us about big data analysis and some more food for thought what statisticians think about data scientists talking machines 12
