in massive open online courses mooc with a selection of more than 300 classes from 62 different institutions as of february 2013 generous contributions by educators and institutions are making excellent education available to many who could not afford it otherwise there are even non profits with feet on the ground in remote areas of the world who are helping spread the wealth see the feedback below from tunapanda this script makes it easier to batch download lecture resources e g videos ppt etc for coursera classes given one or more class names and account credentials it obtains week and class names from the lectures page and then downloads the related materials into appropriately named files and directories why is this helpful a utility like wget can work but has the following limitations video names have numbers in them but this does not correspond to the actual order manually renaming them is a pain that is best left for computers using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names using wget in a for loop picks up extra videos which are not posted linked and these are sometimes duplicates browser extensions like downloadthemall is another possibility but coursera dl provides more features such as appropriately named files this work was originally inspired in part by youtube dl by which ive downloaded many other good videos such as those from khan academy features support for all kinds of courses i e old platform time based as well as new platform on demand courses intentionally detailed names so that it will display and sort properly on most interfaces e g vlc or mx video on android devices regex based section week and lecture name filters to download only certain resources file format extension filter to grab resource types you want login credentials accepted on command line or from netrc file default arguments loaded from coursera dl conf file core functionality tested on linux mac and windows disclaimer coursera dl is meant to be used only for your material that coursera gives you access to download we do not encourage any use that violates their terms of use a relevant excerpt coursera grants you a personal non exclusive non transferable license to access and use the sites you may download material from the sites only for your own personal non commercial use you may not otherwise copy reproduce retransmit distribute publish commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any material nor may you modify or create derivatives works of the material installation instructions coursera dl requires python 2 or python 3 and a free coursera account enrolled in the class of interest as of february of 2016 we test automatically the execution of the program with python versions 2 6 2 7 pypy 3 4 3 5 and 3 6 note we strongly recommend that you use a python 3 interpreter 3 4 or later on any operating system ensure that the python executable location is added to your path environment variable and once you have the dependencies installed see next section for a basic usage you will need to invoke the script from the main directory of the project and prepend it with the word python you can also use more advanced features of the program by looking at the running the script section of this document note you must already have manually agreed to the honor of code of the particular courses that you want to use with coursera dl recommended installation method for all operating systems from a command line preferably from a virtual environment simply issue the command pip install coursera dl this will download the latest released version of the program from the python package index pypi along with all the necessary dependencies at this point you should be ready to start using it if this does not work because your python 2 version is too old e g 2 7 5 on ubuntu 14 4 try apt get install python3 python3 pip pip3 install coursera dl instead note 1 we strongly recommend that you dont install the package globally on your machine i e with root administrator privileges as the installed modules may conflict with other python applications that you have installed in your system or they can interfere with coursera dl prefer to use the option user to pip install if you need can note 2 as already mentioned we strongly recommend that you use a new python 3 interpreter e g 3 4 or later since python 3 has better support for ssl tls for secure connections than earlier versions if you must use python 2 be sure that you have at least python 2 7 9 later versions are ok otherwise you can still use coursera dl but you will have to install the extra package ndg httpsclient which may involve compilation at least on linux systems alternative ways of installing missing dependencies we strongly recommend that you consider installing python packages with pip as in it is the current preferred method unless directed otherwise by one of the project members for instance when testing or debugging a new feature or using the source code directly from our git repository if you are using pip you can directly install all the dependencies from the requirements file using pip install r requirements txt alternative installation method for unix systems we strongly recommend that you install coursera dl and all its dependencies in a way that does not interfere with the rest of your python installation this is accomplished by the creation of a virtual environment or virtualenv for the initial setup in a unix like operating system please use the following steps create adapt first the directory directory where i want my courses cd directory where i want my courses virtualenv my coursera cd my coursera source bin activate git clone https github com coursera dl coursera dl cd coursera dl pip install r requirements txt coursera dl to further download new videos from your classes simply perform cd directory where i want my courses my coursera source bin activate cd coursera dl coursera dl we are working on streamlining this whole process so that it is as simple as possible but to support older versions of python and to cope with coursera disabling sslv3 we have to take a few extra steps in any case it is highly recommended that you always install the latest version of the python interpreter that you can archlinux aur package coursera dl installing dependencies on your own warning this method is not recommended unless you have experience working with multiple python environments you can use the pip program to install the dependencies on your own they are all listed in the requirements txt file and the extra dependencies needed for development are listed in the requirements dev txt file to use this method you would proceed as pip install r requirements txt pip install r requirements dev txt the second line above should only be needed if you intend to help with development and help is always welcome or if a maintainer of the project asks you to install extra packages for debugging purposes once again before filing bug reports if you installed the dependencies on your own please check that the versions of your modules are at least those listed in the requirements txt file and requirements dev txt file if applicable docker if you prefer you can run this software inside docker docker run rm it v \ pwd courses \ courseradl courseradl u user p password or using netrc file docker run rm it \ v pwd courses v home netrc netrc \ courseradl courseradl n netrc the actual working dir for coursera dl is courses all courses will be downloaded there if you dont specify otherwise windows python m pip install coursera dl be sure that the python install path is added to the path system environment variables this can be found in control panel system advanced system settings environment variables example c \python35\scripts\ c \python35\ or if you have restricted installation permissions and youve installed python under appdata add this to your path example c \users\ user \appdata\local\programs\python\python35 32\scripts c \users\ user \appdata\local\programs\python\python35 32 coursera dl can now be run from commandline or powershell create an account with coursera if you dont already have one create a coursera account and enroll in a class see https www coursera org courses for the list of classes running the script run the script to download the materials by providing your coursera account credentials e g email address and password or a netrc file the class names as well as any additional parameters general coursera dl u user p pass modelthinking 004 if you dont want to type your password in command line as plain text you can use the script without p option in this case you will be prompted for password once the script is run without p field coursera dl u user modelthinking 004 multiple classes coursera dl u user p pass saas historyofrock1 001 algo 2012 002 filter by section name coursera dl u user p pass sf

initialize mkdir p current class1 class2 classn update coursera dl n path current \ls current note if your ls command is aliased to display a colorized output you may experience problems be sure to escape the ls command use \ls to assure that no special characters get sent to the script note that we do support the new platform on demand classes on nix platforms the use of a netrc file is a good alternative to specifying both your username i e your email address and password every time on the command line to use it simply add a line like the one below to a file named netrc in your home directory or the equivalent if you are using windows with contents like machine coursera dl login user password pass create the file if it doesnt exist yet from then on you can switch from using u and p to simply call coursera dl with the option n instead this is especially convenient as typing usernames email addresses and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome even more if you happened to choose a strong password alternatively if you want to store your preferred parameters which might also include your username and password create a file named coursera dl conf where the script is supposed to be executed with the following format username user password pass subtitle language en zh cn zh tw download quizzes mathjax cdn https cdn bootcss com mathjax 2 7 1 mathjax js more other parameters parameter which is stored in the file will be overriden if it is again specified in your commandline script note in coursera dl conf all the parameters should not be wrapped with quotes resuming downloads in default mode when you interrupt the download process by pressing ctrl c partially downloaded files will be deleted from your disk and you have to start the download process from the beginning if your download was interrupted by something other than keyboardinterrupt ctrl c like sudden system crash partially downloaded files will remain on your disk and the next time you start the process again these files will be discarded from download list therefore its your job to delete them manually before next start for this reason we added an option called resume which continues your downloads from where they stopped coursera dl u user p pass resume sdn1 001 this option can also be used with external downloaders coursera dl wget u user p pass resume sdn1 001 note 1 some external downloaders use their own built in resume feature which may not be compatible with others so use them at your own risk note 2 remember that in resume mode interrupted files wont be deleted from your disk note if your password contains punctuation quotes or other funny characters e g and so on then you may have to escape them from your shell with bash or other bourne shell clones and probably with many other shells one of the better ways to do so is to enclose your password in single quotes so that you dont run into problems see issue 213 for more information troubleshooting if you have problems when downloading class materials please try to see if one of the following actions solve your problem make sure the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name used in the url for that class https www coursera org learn class name home welcome have you tried to clean the cached cookies credentials with the clear cache option note that many courses most perhaps may remove the materials after a little while after the course is completed while other courses may retain the materials up to a next session offering of the same course to avoid problems with academic dishonesty apparently in short it is not guaranteed that you will be able to download after the course is finished and this is unfortunately nothing that we can help you with make sure you have installed and or updated all of your dependencies according to the requirements txt file as described above one can export a netscape style cookies file with a browser extension 1 2 and use it with the c option this comes in handy when the authentication via password is not working the authentication process changes now and then if results show 0 sections you most likely have provided invalid credentials username and or password in the command line or in your netrc file or in your coursera dl conf file for courses that have not started yet but have had a previous iteration sometimes a preview is available containing all the classes from the last course these files can be downloaded by passing the preview parameter if you get an error like could not find class class name then verify that the name of the course is correct current class names in coursera are composed by a short course name e g class and the current version of the course a number for example for a class named class you would have to use class 001 class 002 etc second verify that you are enrolled in the course you wont be able to access the course materials if you are not officially enrolled and agreed to the honor course via the website if you get an error when using n to specify that you want to use a netrc file and you want the script to use your default netrc file and you get a message saying coursera dl error too few arguments then you should specify as an argument after n that is n or change the order in which you pass the arguments to the script so that the argument after n begins with an hyphen otherwise pythons argparse module will think that what you are passing is the name of the netrc file that you want to use see issue 162 if your password has spaces dont forget to write it using quotes have you installed the right project warning if you installed the script using pypi pip please verify that you installed the correct project we had to use a different name in pip because our original name was already taken remember to install it using pip install coursera dl china issues if you are from china and youre having problems downloading videos adding 52 84 167 78 d3c33hcgiwev3 cloudfront net in the hosts file etc hosts and freshing dns with ipconfig flushdns may work see https github com googlehosts hosts for more info found 0 sections and 0 lectures on this page first of all make sure you are enrolled to the course you want to download many old courses have already closed enrollment so often its not an option in this case try downloading with preview option some courses allow to download lecture materials without enrolling but its not common and is not guaranteed to work for every course finally you can download the videos if you have at least the index file that lists all the course materials maybe your friend who is enrolled could save that course page for you in that case use the process local page option alternatively you may want to try this chrome extension https chrome google com webstore detail coursera materials downlo ijkboagofaehocnjacacdhdcbbcpilih if none of the above works for you there is nothing we can do download timeouts coursera dl supports external downloaders but note that they are only used to download materials after the syllabus has been parsed e g videos pdfs some handouts and additional files syllabus is always downloaded using the internal downloader if you experience problems with downloading such materials you may want to start using external downloader and configure its timeout values for example you can use aria2c downloader by passing aria option coursera dl n path aria2 course name and put this into aria2cs configuration file aria2 aria2 conf to reduce timeouts connect timeout 2 timeout 2 bt stop timeout 1 timeout configuration for internal downloader is not supported windows proxy support if youre on windows behind a proxy set up the environment variables before running the script as

for the good job knowledge will flood the world a little more thanks to your script guillaume v 11 8 2012 just wanted to send you props for your python script to download coursera courses ive been using it in kenya for my non profit to get online courses to places where internet is really expensive and unreliable mostly kids here cant afford high school and downloading one of these classes by the usual means would cost more than the average family earns in one week thanks jay l tunapanda 3 20 2013 i am a big fan of coursera and attend lots of different courses time constraints dont allow me to attend all the courses i want at the same time i came across your script and i am very happily using it great stuff and thanks for making this available on github well done william g 2 18 2013 this script is awesome i was painstakingly downloading each and every video and ppt by hand looked into wget but ran into wildcard issues with html and then i came across your script cant tell you how many hours youve just saved me if youre ever in paris stockholm it is absolutely mandatory that i buy you a beer razvan t 11 26 2012 thanks a lot viktor v 24 04 2013 contact please post bugs and
