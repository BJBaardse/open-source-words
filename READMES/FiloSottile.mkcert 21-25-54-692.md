mkcert mkcert is a simple tool for making locally trusted development certificates it requires no configuration mkcert install created a new local ca at users filippo library application support mkcert üí• the local ca is now installed in the system trust store ‚ö°Ô∏è the local ca is now installed in the firefox trust store requires restart ü¶ä mkcert example com example org myapp dev localhost 127 0 0 1 1 using the local ca at users filippo library application support mkcert ‚ú® created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú example com example org myapp dev localhost 127 0 0 1 1 the certificate is at example com 5 pem and the key at example com 5 key pem ‚úÖ using certificates from real certificate authorities cas for development can be dangerous or impossible for hosts like localhost or 127 0 0 1 but self signed certificates cause trust errors managing your own ca is the best solution but usually involves arcane commands specialized knowledge and manual steps mkcert automatically creates and installs a local ca in the system root store and generates locally trusted certificates installation on macos use homebrew brew install mkcert brew install nss if you use firefox on linux install certutil sudo apt install libnss3 tools or sudo yum install nss tools and build from source requires go 1 10 or use the pre built binaries go get u github com filosottile mkcert go env gopath bin mkcert windows will be supported next prs welcome warning the rootca key pem file that mkcert automatically generates gives complete power to intercept secure requests from your machine do not share it advanced topics mobile devices for the certificates to be trusted on mobile devices you will have to install the root ca its the rootca pem file in the folder printed by mkcert caroot on ios you can either email the ca to yourself or serve it from an http server after installing it you must enable full trust in it for android you will have to install the ca and then enable user roots in the development build of your app see this stackoverflow answer changing the location of the ca files the ca certificate and its key are stored in an application data folder in the user home you usually dont have to worry about it as installation is automated but the location is printed by mkcert caroot if you want to manage separate cas you can use the environment variable caroot to set the folder where mkcert will place and look for the local ca files installing the ca on other systems installing in the trust store does not require the ca key so you can export the ca certificate and use mkcert to install it in other machines look for the rootca pem file in mkcert caroot copy it to a different machine set caroot to its directory run mkcert install remember that mkcert is meant for development purposes not production so it should not be used on end users machines and that you should not export or share rootca key pem this is not an official google project just some code that happens to be owned by google
