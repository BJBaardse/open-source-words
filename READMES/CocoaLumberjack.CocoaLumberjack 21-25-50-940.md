migrating to 3 x to be determined features lumberjack is fast simple yet powerful flexible it is similar in concept to other popular logging frameworks such as log4j yet is designed specifically for objective c and takes advantage of features such as multi threading grand central dispatch if available lockless atomic operations and the dynamic nature of the objective c runtime lumberjack is fast in most cases it is an order of magnitude faster than nslog lumberjack is simple it takes as little as a single line of code to configure lumberjack when your application launches then simply replace your nslog statements with ddlog statements and thats about it and the ddlog macros have the exact same format and syntax as nslog so its super easy lumberjack is powerful one log statement can be sent to multiple loggers meaning you can log to a file and the console simultaneously want more create your own loggers its easy and send your log statements over the network or to a database or distributed file system the sky is the limit lumberjack is flexible configure your logging however you want change log levels per file perfect for debugging change log levels per logger verbose console but concise log file change log levels per xcode configuration verbose debug but concise release have your log statements compiled out of the release build customize the number of log levels for your application add your own fine grained logging dynamically change log levels during runtime choose how when you want your log files to be rolled upload your log files to a central server compress archived log files to save disk space this framework is for you if youre looking for a way to track down that impossible to reproduce bug that keeps popping up in the field youre frustrated
