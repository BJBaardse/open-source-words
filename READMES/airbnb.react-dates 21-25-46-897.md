react dates an easily internationalizable accessible mobile friendly datepicker library for the web live playground for examples of the datepicker in action go to http airbnb io react dates or to run that demo on your own computer clone this repository npm install npm run storybook visit http localhost 6006 getting started install dependencies ensure packages are installed with correct version numbers by running sh export pkg react dates npm info pkg peerdependencies json command sed s \ \ g s g s g xargs npm install save pkg which produces and runs a command like sh npm install save react dates moment react react dom initialize js import react dates initialize as of v13 0 0 of react dates this project relies on react with styles if you want to continue using css stylesheets and classes there is a little bit of extra set up required to get things going as such you need to import react dates initialize to set up class names on our components this import should go at the top of your application as you wont be able to import any react dates components without it note this component assumes box sizing border box is set globally in your pages css include component js import daterangepicker singledatepicker daypickerrangecontroller from react dates webpack using webpack with css loader add the following import to your app js import react dates lib css datepicker css without webpack create a css file with the contents of require resolve react dates lib css datepicker css and include it in your html head section to see this in action you can check out https github com majapw react dates demo which adds react dates on top of a simple create react app setup overriding styles right now the easiest way to tweak react dates to your hearts content is to create another stylesheet to override the default react dates styles for example you could create a file named react dates overrides css with the following contents css calendarday highlighted calendar background 82e0aa color 186a3b calendarday highlighted calendar hover background 58d68d color 186a3b calendarday highlighted calendar active background 58d68d color 186a3b this would override the background and text colors applied to highlighted calendar days you can use this method with the default set up to override any aspect of the calendar to have it better fit to your particular needs make some awesome datepickers we provide a handful of components for your use if you supply essential props to each component youll get a full featured interactive date picker with additional optional props you can customize the look and feel of the inputs calendar etc you can see what each of the props do in the live demo or explore how to properly wrap the pickers in the examples folder daterangepicker the daterangepicker is a fully controlled component that allows users to select a date range you can control the selected dates using the startdate enddate and ondateschange props as shown below the daterangepicker also manages internal state for partial dates entered by typing although ondateschange will not trigger until a date has been entered completely in that case similarly you can control which input is focused as well as calendar visibility the calendar is only visible if focusedinput is defined with the focusedinput and onfocuschange props as shown below here is the minimum required setup you need to get the daterangepicker working jsx daterangepicker startdate this state startdate momentproptypes momentobj or null startdateid your unique start date id proptypes

similarly you can control whether or not the input is focused calendar visibility is also controlled with the same props with the focused and onfocuschange props as shown below here is the minimum

daypickerrangecontroller the daypickerrangecontroller is a calendar only version of the daterangepicker there are no inputs which also means that currently it is not keyboard accessible and the calendar is always visible but you can select a date range much in the same way you would with the daterangepicker you can control the selected dates using the startdate enddate and ondateschange props as shown below similarly you can control which input is focused with the focusedinput and onfocuschange props as shown below the user will only be able to select a date if focusedinput is

ones project loading a locale is done by calling moment locale in the component where moment is imported with the locale key of choice for instance js moment locale pl polish however this only solves date localization for complete internationalization of the components react dates defines a certain amount of user interface strings in english which can be changed through the phrases prop explore the storybook for examples for accessibility and usability concerns all these ui elements should be translated advanced react dates no longer relies strictly on css but rather relies on react with styles as an abstraction layer between how styles are applied and how they are written the instructions above will get the project working out of the box but theres a lot more customization that can be done interfaces the react dates initialize script actually relies on react with styles interface css under the hood if you are interested in a different solution for styling in your project you can do your own initialization of a another interface at airbnb for instance we rely on aphrodite under the hood and therefore use the aphrodite interface for react with styles if you want to do the same you would use the following pattern js import themedstylesheet from react with styles lib themedstylesheet import aphroditeinterface from react with styles interface aphrodite import defaulttheme from react dates lib theme defaulttheme themedstylesheet registerinterface aphroditeinterface themedstylesheet registertheme defaulttheme the above code has to be run before any react dates component is imported otherwise you will get an error also note that if you register any custom interface manually you must also manually register a theme theming react dates also now supports a different way to theme you can see the default theme values in this file and you would override them in the following manner js import themedstylesheet from react with styles lib themedstylesheet import aphroditeinterface from react with styles interface aphrodite import defaulttheme from react dates lib theme defaulttheme themedstylesheet registerinterface aphroditeinterface themedstylesheet registertheme reactdates defaulttheme reactdates color defaulttheme reactdates color highlighted backgroundcolor 82e0aa backgroundcolor active 58d68d backgroundcolor hover 58d68d color 186a3b color active 186a3b color hover 186a3b the above code would use shades of green instead of shades of yellow for the highlight color on calendarday components note that you must register an interface if you manually register a theme one will not work without the other a note on using react with styles interface css the default interface that react dates ships with is the css interface if you want to use this interface along with the theme registration method you will need to rebuild the core datepicker css file we do not currently expose a utility method to build this file but you can follow along with the code in https github com airbnb react dates blob master scripts buildcss js to build your own custom themed css file
