library bindings groovy implementation com jakewharton rxbinding2 rxbinding support v4 2 1 1 appcompat v7 library bindings groovy implementation com jakewharton rxbinding2 rxbinding appcompat v7 2 1 1 design library bindings groovy implementation com jakewharton rxbinding2 rxbinding design 2 1 1 recyclerview v7 library bindings groovy implementation com jakewharton rxbinding2 rxbinding recyclerview v7 2 1 1 leanback v17 library bindings groovy implementation com jakewharton rxbinding2 rxbinding leanback v17 2 1 1 kotlin extension methods for all of the above libraries are available by appending kotlin to the artifactid of the dependency for example rxbinding support v4 becomes rxbinding support v4 kotlin snapshots of the development version are available in sonatypes snapshots repository development the bindings for androids platform types are in rxbinding weak references should not be used rxjavas subscription graph allows for proper garbage collections of reference holding objects provided the caller unsubscribes mapping an observable to an android event e g view clicks is a direct mapping the library is not responsible for supporting multiple observables bound to the same view multiple listeners to the same view events can be achieved through operators like publish share or replay consult the rxjava documentation for which is appropriate for the behavior that you want naming conventions of classes and their packages should provide unambiguous information on where functionality can be found helpers for platform classes can be found in packages of the same name but prefixed with com jakewharton rxbinding instead of android and classes of the same name but prefixed with rx for example android widget textview bindings are in com jakewharton rxbinding widget rxtextview observable factory method names is the plural of the verb e g click clicks the verb should be in the present tense regardless of the platforms use e g selected selection when there are multiple versions of the same verb prefix with a qualifying noun or adjective that differentiates e g click vs long click item selection vs nothing selection if the listener callback provides more than one parameter of useful data a factory method overload named in the singular and suffixed with events is included this overload emits wrapper objects containing all the additional information about the event the name of the wrapper object is the concatenation of the view simple name the verb with optional adverb prefix and event these classes are in the public api events for listeners with multiple methods should share an abstract base class the naming follows the same rules as a normal event class but without the qualifying prefix the constructor should be package private to prevent subclasses other than those defined for the listener methods this class should be in the public api the name of the onsubscribe class for each observable is the concatenation of the view simple name the verb with optional prefix and onsubscribe these classes not in the public api action factory method names are the same as the property e g enabled if the associated listener has a return value an overload that accepts a func1 e t named handled will be present for determining that value no error handling will be done these classes are not in the public api and are currently defined anonymously support modules sibling modules exist for various support libraries such as rxbinding recyclerview v7 for the recyclerview v7 support library the folder name and artifact id is rxbinding plus the suffix of the artifact id of the target library the manifest package name for each module is the name of the target librarys package but prefixed with com jakewharton rxbinding instead of android for example android support v7 recyclerview becomes com jakewharton rxbinding support v7 recyclerview the location of the binding classes and their content follows the same rule as the core rxbinding module outlined above kotlin modules for the core rxbinding module as well as each support module a sibling module exists which provides kotlin extension methods for each binding method directly on the target type the name of each module is the name of the target module with a suffix of kotlin these modules do not need to be edited directly running the generatekotlin task will create the bindings automatically from the methods in each respective binding modules these files should be checked in when changed license copyright c 2015 jake wharton licensed under the apache license version
