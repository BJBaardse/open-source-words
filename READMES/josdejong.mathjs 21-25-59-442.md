http mathjs org math js is an extensive math library for javascript and node js it features a flexible expression parser with support for symbolic computation comes with a large set of built in functions and constants and offers an integrated solution to work with different data types like numbers big numbers complex numbers fractions units and matrices powerful and easy to use features supports numbers big numbers complex numbers fractions units strings arrays and matrices is compatible with javascripts built in math library contains a flexible expression parser does symbolic computation comes with a large set of built in functions and constants can be used as a command line application as well runs on any javascript engine is easily extensible open source usage math js can be used in both node js and in the browser install math js using npm npm install mathjs or download mathjs via one of the cdns listed on the downloads page http mathjs org download html math js can be used similar to javascripts built in math library besides that math js can evaluate expressions and supports chained operations js load math js const math require mathjs functions and constants math round math e 3 2 718 math atan2 3 3 math pi 0 75 math log 10000 10 4 math sqrt 4 2i math pow 1 2 3 1 2 7 0 0 7 math derivative x 2 x x 2 x 1 expressions math eval 12 2 3 0 7 4 math eval 12 7 cm to inch 5 inch math eval sin 45 deg 2 0 5 math eval 9 3 2i 3 2i math eval det 1 2 3 1 7 chaining math chain 3 add 4 multiply 2 done 14 see the getting started for a more detailed tutorial browser support math js works on any es5 compatible javascript engine node js 4 or newer chrome firefox safari edge and ie11 though there is no official support for older browsers math js should still work on older browsers when using the es5 shim documentation getting started examples overview history build first clone the project from github git clone git github com josdejong mathjs git cd mathjs install the project dependencies npm install then the project can be build by executing the build script via npm npm run build this will build the library math js and math min js from the source files and put them in the folder dist test to execute tests for the library install the project dependencies once npm install then the tests can be executed npm test additionally the tests can be run on firefox using headless mode npm run test browser to run the tests on remotely on browserstack first set the environment variables browser stack username and browser stack access key with your username and access key and then execute npm run test browserstack to test code coverage of the tests npm run coverage to see the coverage results open the generated report in your browser coverage lcov report index html continuous integration testing continuous integration tests are run on travis ci and browserstack every time a commit is pushed to github the test results can be checked on https travis ci org josdejong mathjs travis ci runs the tests for different versions of node js and browserstack runs the tests are run on all major browsers thanks travis ci and browserstack for the generous free hosting of this open source project license copyright c 2013 2018 jos de jong wjosdejong gmail com licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
