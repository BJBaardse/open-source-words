youcompleteme a code completion engine for vim help advice support looking for help advice or support having problems getting ycm to work first carefully read the installation instructions for your os we recommend you use the supplied install py next check the user guide section on the semantic completer that you are using for c c objective c you must read this section finally check the faq if

code of conduct contact license intro youcompleteme is a fast as you type fuzzy search code completion engine for vim it has several completion engines an identifier based engine that works with every programming language a clang based engine that provides native semantic code completion for c c objective c objective c from now on referred to as the c family languages a jedi based completion engine for python 2 and 3 using the jedihttp wrapper an omnisharp based completion engine for c a combination of gocode and godef semantic engines for go a tsserver based completion engine for typescript a tern based completion engine for javascript a racer based completion engine for rust a jdt ls based experimental completion engine for java and an omnifunc based completer that uses data from vims omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many other languages ruby php etc heres an explanation of what happens in the short gif demo above first realize that no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed to get the list of completion candidates at any point in the demo the user just types and the suggestions pop up by themselves if the user doesnt find the completion suggestions relevant and or just wants to type they can do so the completion engine will not interfere when the user sees a useful completion string being offered they press the tab key to accept it this inserts the completion string repeated presses of the tab key cycle through the offered completions if the offered completions are not relevant enough the user can continue typing to further filter out unwanted completions a critical thing to notice is that the completion filtering is not based on the input being a string prefix of the completion but that works too the input needs to be a subsequence match of a completion this is a fancy way of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in the order in which they appear in the input so abc is a subsequence of xaybgc but not of xbyxaxxc after the filter a complicated sorting system ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of the menu so you usually need to press tab just once all of the above works with any programming language because of the identifier based completion engine it collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit and your tags files and searches them when you type identifiers are put into per filetype groups the demo also shows the semantic engine in use when the user presses or while typing in insert mode for c different triggers are used for other languages the semantic engine is triggered it can also be triggered with a keyboard shortcut see the rest of the docs the last thing that you can see in the demo is ycms diagnostic display features the little red x that shows up in the left gutter inspired by syntastic if you are editing a c family file as clang compiles your file and detects warnings or errors they will be presented in various ways you dont need to save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this it just happens in the background in essence ycm obsoletes the following vim plugins because it has all of their features plus extra clang complete autocomplpop supertab neocomplcache and thats not all ycm also provides semantic ide like features in a number of languages including finding declarations definitions usages etc of identifiers displaying type information for classes variables functions etc displaying documentation for methods members etc in the preview window fixing common coding errors like missing semi colons typos etc semantic renaming of variables across files formatting code removing unused imports sorting imports etc features vary by file type so make sure to check out the file type feature summary and the full list of completer subcommands to find out whats available for your favourite languages youll also find that ycm has filepath completers try typing in a file and a completer that integrates with ultisnips installation mac os x these instructions using install py are the quickest way to install youcompleteme however they may not work for everyone if the following instructions dont work for you check out the full installation guide install the latest version of macvim yes macvim and yes the latest if you dont use the macvim gui it is recommended to use the vim binary that is inside the macvim app package macvim app contents macos vim to ensure it works correctly copy the mvim script from the macvim download to your local binary folder for example usr local bin mvim and then symlink it ln s usr local bin mvim vim install youcompleteme with vundle remember ycm is a plugin with a compiled component if you update ycm using vundle and the ycm core library apis have changed happens rarely ycm will notify you to recompile it you should then rerun the install process note if you want c family completion you must have the latest xcode installed along with the latest command line tools they are installed automatically when you run clang for the first time or manually by running xcode select install install cmake

install must match up exactly with the version of python that vim is looking for type version and look at the bottom of the page at the list of compiler flags look for flags that look similar to ddynamic python dll \ python27 dll\ and ddynamic python3 dll \ python35 dll\ the former indicates that vim is looking for python 2 7 and the latter indicates that vim is looking for python 3 5 youll

are a few interesting options that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on full installation guide these are the steps necessary to get ycm working on a unix os and on windows note to windows users we assume that you are running the cmd exe command prompt and that the needed executables are in the path environment variable do not just copy the shell commands replace by userprofile in them and use the right vim home directory it should be vimfiles by default instead of vim see the faq if you have any issues remember ycm is a plugin with a compiled component if you update ycm using vundle and the ycm core library apis have changed happens rarely ycm will notify you to recompile it you should then rerun the install process please follow the instructions carefully read every word ensure that your version of vim is at least 7 4 1578 and that it has support for python 2 or python 3 scripting inside vim type version look at the first two to three lines of output it should say vi improved x y where x y is the major version of vim if your version is greater than 7 4 then youre all set if your version is 7 4 then look below that where it says included patches 1 z where z will be some number that number needs to be 1578 or higher if your version of vim is not recent enough you may need to compile vim from source dont worry its easy after you have made sure that you have vim 7 4 1578 type the following in vim echo has python has python3 the output should be 1 if its 0 then get a version of vim with python support on windows check also if your vim architecture is 32 or 64 bit this is critical because it must match the python and the ycm libraries architectures we recommend using a 64 bit vim install ycm with vundle or pathogen but vundle is a better idea with vundle this would mean adding a plugin valloric youcompleteme line to your vimrc if you dont install ycm with vundle make sure you have run git submodule update init recursive after checking out the ycm repository vundle will do this for you to fetch ycms dependencies complete this step only if you care about semantic completion support for c family languages otherwise its not necessary download the latest version of libclang clang is an open source compiler that can compile c c objective c objective c the libclang library it provides is used to power the ycm semantic completion engine for those languages ycm is designed to work with libclang version 3 9 or higher you can use the system libclang only if you are sure it is version 3 9 or higher otherwise dont even if it is we recommend using the official binaries from llvm org if at all possible make sure you download the correct archive file for your os we strongly recommend against use of the system libclang instead of the upstream compiled binaries random things may break save yourself the hassle and use the upstream pre built libclang compile the ycm core library that ycm needs this library is the c engine that ycm uses to get fast completions you will need to have cmake installed in order to generate the required makefiles linux users can install cmake with their package manager sudo apt get install cmake for ubuntu whereas other users can download and install cmake from its project site mac users can also get it through homebrew with brew install cmake on a unix os you need to make sure you have python headers installed on a debian like linux distro this would be sudo apt get install python dev python3 dev on mac they should already be present on windows you need to download and install python 2 or python 3 pick the version corresponding to your vim architecture you will also need microsoft visual c msvc to build ycm you can obtain it by installing visual studio msvc 14 visual studio 2015 and 15 2017 are officially supported here well assume you installed ycm with vundle that means that the top level ycm directory is in vim bundle youcompleteme well create a new folder where build files will be placed run the following cd mkdir ycm build cd ycm build now we need to generate the makefiles if you dont care about semantic support for c family languages run the following command in the ycm build directory cmake g generator vim bundle youcompleteme third party ycmd cpp where generator is unix makefiles on unix systems and one of the following visual studio generators on windows visual studio 14 win64 visual studio 15 win64 remove the win64 part in these generators if your vim architecture is 32 bit for those who want to use the system version of boost you would pass duse system boost on to cmake this may be necessary on some systems where the bundled version of boost doesnt compile out of the box note we strongly recommend against use of the system boost instead of the bundled version of boost random things may break save yourself the hassle and use the bundled version of boost if you do care about semantic support for c family languages then your cmake call will be a bit more complicated well assume you downloaded a binary distribution of llvm clang from llvm org in step 3 and that you extracted the archive file to folder ycm temp llvm root dir with bin lib include etc folders right inside that folder on windows you can extract the files from the llvm clang installer using 7 zip note this only works with a downloaded llvm binary package not a custom built llvm see docs below for external libclang path when using a custom llvm build with that in mind run the following command in the ycm build directory cmake g generator dpath to llvm root ycm temp llvm root dir vim bundle youcompleteme third party ycmd cpp where generator is replaced like above now that configuration files have been generated compile the libraries using this command cmake build target ycm core config release the config release part is specific to windows and will be ignored on a unix os for those who want to use the system version of libclang you would pass duse system libclang on to cmake instead of the dpath to llvm root flag note we strongly recommend against use of the system libclang instead of the upstream compiled binaries random things may break save yourself the hassle and use the upstream pre built libclang you could also force the use of a custom libclang library with dexternal libclang path path to libclang so flag the library would end with dylib on a mac again this flag would be used instead of the other flags if you compiled llvm from source this is the flag you should be using running the cmake command will also place the libclang so dylib dll in the youcompleteme third party ycmd folder for you if you compiled with clang support it needs to be there for ycm to work this step is optional build the regex module for improved unicode support and better performance with regular expressions the procedure is similar to compiling the ycm core library cd mkdir regex build cd regex build cmake g generator vim bundle youcompleteme third party ycmd third party cregex cmake build target regex config release where generator is the same generator used in the previous step set up support for additional languages as desired c support install mono on non windows platforms navigate to youcompleteme third party ycmd third party omnisharpserver and run msbuild property configuration release property platform any cpu property targetframeworkversion v4 5 on windows be sure that the build utility msbuild is in your path go support install go and add it to your path navigate to youcompleteme third party ycmd third party gocode and run go build typescript support as with the quick installation simply npm install g typescript after successfully installing node js and npm javascript support install node js and npm then navigate to youcompleteme third party ycmd third party tern runtime and run npm install production rust support install rust navigate to youcompleteme third party ycmd third party racerd and run cargo build release java support install jdk8 version 8 required download a binary release of eclipse jdt ls and extract it to youcompleteme third party ycmd third party eclipse jdt ls target repository note this approach is not recommended for most users and is supported only for advanced users and developers of ycm on a best efforts basis please use install py to enable java support thats it youre done refer to the user guide section on how to use ycm dont forget that if you want the c family semantic completion engine to work you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to ycm its all in the user guide ycm comes with sane defaults for its options but you still may want to take a look at whats available for configuration there are a few interesting

general usage if the offered completions are too broad keep typing characters ycm will continue refining the offered completions based on your input filtering is smart case and smart diacritic sensitive if you are typing only lowercase letters then its case insensitive if your input contains uppercase letters then the uppercase letters in your query must match uppercase letters in the completion strings the lowercase letters still match both on top of that a letter with no diacritic marks will match that letter with or without marks matches foo fôo foo fôo foo ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ fôo ❌ ✔️ ❌ ✔️ foo ❌ ❌ ✔️ ✔️ fôo ❌ ❌ ❌ ✔️ use the tab key to accept a completion and continue pressing tab to cycle through the completions use shift tab to cycle backwards note that if youre using console vim that is not gvim or macvim then its likely that the shift tab binding will not work because the console will not pass it to vim you can remap the keys see the options section below knowing a little bit about how ycm works internally will prevent confusion ycm has several completion engines an identifier based completer that collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit and your tags files and searches them when you type identifiers are put into per filetype groups there are also several semantic engines in ycm theres a libclang based completer that provides semantic completion for c family languages theres a jedi based completer for semantic completion for python theres also an omnifunc based completer that uses data from vims omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language in ycm there are also other completion engines like the ultisnips completer and the filepath completer ycm automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any situation on occasion it queries several of them at once merges the outputs and presents the results to you client server architecture ycm has a client server architecture the vim part of ycm is only a thin client that talks to the ycmd http json server that has the vast majority of ycm logic and functionality the server is started and stopped automatically as you start and stop vim completion string ranking the subsequence filter removes any completions that do not match the input but then the sorting system kicks in its actually very complicated and uses lots of factors but suffice it to say that word boundary wb subsequence character matches are worth more than non wb matches in effect this means given an input of gua the completion getuseraccount would be ranked higher in the list than the fooguxa completion both of which are subsequence matches a word boundary character are all capital characters characters preceded by an underscore and the first letter character in the completion string general semantic completion you can use ctrl space to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere even without a string prefix this is useful to see which top level functions are available for use c family semantic completion in order to perform semantic analysis such as code completion goto and diagnostics youcompleteme uses libclang this is the library version of the clang compiler sometimes also referred to as llvm like any compiler libclang requires a set of compile flags in order to parse your code simply put if libclang cant parse your code youcompleteme cant provide semantic analysis there are 2 methods which can be used to provide compile flags to libclang option 1 use a compilation database the easiest way to get ycm to compile your code is to use a compilation database a compilation database is usually generated by your build system e g cmake and contains the compiler invocation for each compilation unit in your project for information on how to generate a compilation database see the clang documentation in short if using cmake add dcmake export compile commands on when configuring or add set cmake export compile commands on to cmakelists txt and copy or symlink the generated database to the root of your project if using ninja check out the compdb tool t compdb in its docs if using gnu make check out bear for other build systems check out ycm extra conf py below if no ycm extra conf py is found and no ycm global ycm extra conf is configured youcompleteme automatically tries to load a compilation database if one is found ycm looks for a file named compile commands json in the directory of the opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy recursively when the file is found it is loaded youcompleteme performs the following lookups when extracting flags for a particular file if the database contains an entry for the file the flags for that file are used if the file is a header file and a source file with the same root exists in the database the flags for the source file are used for example if the file is home test project src lib something h and the database contains an entry for home test project src lib something cc then the flags for home test project src lib something cc are used otherwise if any flags have been returned from the directory containing the requested file those flags are used this heuristic is intended to provide potentially working flags for newly created files finally ycm converts any relative paths in the extracted flags to absolute paths this ensures that compilation can be performed from any vim working directory option 2 provide the flags manually if you dont have a compilation database or arent able to generate one you have to tell youcompleteme how to compile your code some other way every c family project is different it is not possible for ycm to guess what compiler flags to supply for your project fortunately ycm provides a mechanism for you to generate the flags for a particular file with arbitrary complexity this is achieved by requiring you to provide a python module which implements a trivial function which given the file name as argument returns a list of compiler flags to use to compile that file ycm looks for a ycm extra conf py file in the directory of the opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy recursively when the file is found it is loaded only once as a python module ycm calls a flagsforfile method in that module which should provide it with the information necessary to compile the current file you can also provide a path to a global ycm extra conf py file which will be used as a fallback to prevent the execution of malicious code from a file you didnt write ycm will ask you once per ycm extra conf py if it is safe to load this can be disabled and you can white blacklist files see the options section for more details this system was designed this way so that the user can perform any arbitrary sequence of operations to produce a list of compilation flags ycm should hand to clang note it is highly recommended to include x language flag to libclang this is so that the correct language is detected particularly for header files common values are x c for c x c for c x objc for objective c and x cuda for cuda to give you an impression if your c project is trivial and your usual compilation command is g wall wextra werror o file o file cc then the following ycm extra conf py is enough to get semantic analysis from youcompleteme python def flagsforfile filename kwargs return flags x c wall wextra werror as you can see from the trivial example ycm calls the flagsforfile method passing it the file name the kwargs is for advanced users and can usually be ignored the flagsforfile function returns a dictionary with a single element flags this element is a list of compiler flags to pass to libclang for the file filename thats it this is actually enough for most projects but for complex projects it is not uncommon to integrate directly with an existing build system using the full power of the python language for a more elaborate example see ycms own ycm extra conf py you should be able to use it as a starting point dont just copy paste that file somewhere and expect things to magically work your project needs different flags hint just replace the strings in the flags variable with compilation flags necessary for your project that should be enough for 99 of projects you could also consider using ycm generator to generate the ycm extra conf py file errors during compilation if clang encounters errors when compiling the header files that your file includes then its probably going to take a long time to get completions when the completion menu finally appears its going to have a large number of unrelated completion strings type function names that are not actually members this is because clang fails to build a precompiled preamble for your file if there are any errors in the included headers and that preamble is key to getting fast completions call the ycmdiags command to see if any errors or warnings were detected in your file java semantic completion note java support is currently experimental please let us know your feedback java quick start ensure that you have enabled the java completer see the installation guide for details create a project file gradle or maven file in the root directory of your java project by following the instructions below if you previously used eclim or syntastic for java disable them for java edit a java file from your project for the best experience we highly recommend at least vim 8 0 1493 when using java support with youcompleteme java project files in order to provide semantic analysis the java completion engine requires knowledge of your project structure in particular it needs to know the class path to use when compiling your code fortunately jdt ls supports eclipse project files maven projects and gradle projects note our recommendation is to use either maven or gradle projects diagnostic display syntastic the native support for java includes ycms native realtime diagnostics display this can conflict with other diagnostics plugins like syntastic so when enabling java support please manually disable syntastic java diagnostics add the following to your vimrc viml let g syntastic java checkers diagnostic display eclim the native support for java includes ycms native realtime diagnostics display this can conflict with other diagnostics plugins like eclim so when enabling java support please manually disable eclim java diagnostics add the following to your vimrc viml let g eclimfiletypevalidate 0 note we recommend disabling eclim entirely when editing java with ycms native java support this can be done temporarily with eclimdisable eclipse projects eclipse style projects require two files project and classpath if your project already has these files due to previously being set up within eclipse then no setup is required jdt ls should load the project just fine its basically eclipse after all however if not it is possible easy in fact to craft them manually though it is not recommended youre better off using gradle or maven see below a simple eclipse style project example can be found in the ycmd test directory normally all that is required is to copy these files to the root of your project and to edit the classpath to add additional libraries such as xml classpathentry kind lib path path to external jar classpathentry kind lib path path to external java source it may also be necessary to change the directory in which your source files are located paths are relative to the project file itself xml classpathentry kind src output target classes path path to src note the eclipse project and classpath files are not a public interface and it is highly recommended to use maven or gradle project definitions if you dont already use eclipse to manage your projects maven projects maven needs a file named pom xml in the root of the project once again a simple pom xml can be found in ycmd source the format of pom xml files is way beyond the scope of this document but we do recommend using the various tools that can generate them for you if youre not familiar with them already gradle projects gradle projects require a build gradle again there is a trivial example in ycmds tests the format of build gradle files is way beyond the scope of this document but we do recommend using the various tools that can generate them for you if youre not familiar with them already troubleshooting if youre not getting completions or diagnostics check the server health the java completion engine takes a while to start up and parse your project you should be able to see its progress in the command line and ycmdebuginfo ensure that the following lines are present jdt ls java language server running jdt ls java language server startup status ready if the above lines dont appear after a few minutes check the jdt ls and ycmd log files using ycmtogglelogs the jdt ls log file is called log for some reason if you get a message about classpath is incomplete then make sure you have correctly configured the project files if you get messages about unresolved imports then make sure you have correctly configured the project files in particular check that the classpath is set correctly for anything else contact us java support is experimental at present so wed love to hear your feedback please do remember to check contributing md for the list of diagnostics well need javascript semantic completion javascript quick start ensure that you have enabled the javascript completer see the installation guide for details create a tern project file in the root directory of your javascript project by following the instructions in the tern documentation edit a file from your project explanation javascript completion is based on tern this completion engine requires a file named tern project to exist in the current working directory or a directory which is an ancestor of the current working directory when the tern server is started ycm starts the tern server the first time a javascript file is edited and uses its directory as the working directory so the directory of that file at that time needs to be a descendent of the directory containing the tern project file or that directory itself alternatively as described in the tern documentation a global tern config file may be used multiple tern servers are not supported to switch to a different javascript project you need to restart the tern server using the restartserver subcommand while editing a file of that project vim ycmcompleter restartserver tips and tricks this section contains some advice for configuring tern project and working with javascript files the canonical reference for correctly configuring tern is the tern documentation any issues improvements advice etc should be sought from the tern project for example see the list of tern plugins for the list of plugins which can be enabled in the plugins section of the tern project file configuring tern for node support the following simple example tern project file enables nodejs support json plugins node configuring tern for requirejs support the tern requirejs plugin requires that all included libraries are rooted under the same base directory if thats not the case for your projects then it is possible to make it work with appropriate symbolic links for example create a directory ext lib within your project and populate it with symlinks to your libraries then set up the tern project something like this json plugins requirejs baseurl ext lib then given the following structure ext lib mylib symlink ext lib anotherlib symlink can be used as follows javascript define mylib file1 anotherlib anotherfile function f1 f2 etc python semantic completion completion and goto commands work out of the box with no additional configuration those features are provided by the jedi library which supports a variety of python versions 2 6 2 7 3 2 as long as it runs in the corresponding python interpreter by default ycm runs jedi with the same python interpreter used by the ycmd server so if you would like to use a different interpreter use the following option specifying the python binary to use for example to provide python 3 completion in your project set viml let g ycm python binary path usr bin python3 if the value of g ycm python binary path is an absolute path like above it will be used as is but if its an executable name it will be searched through the path so for example if you set viml let g ycm python binary path python ycm will use the first python executable it finds in the path to run jedi this means that if you are in a virtual environment and you start vim in that directory the first python that ycm will find will be the one in the virtual environment so jedi will be able to provide completions for every package you have in the virtual environment rust semantic completion completions and goto commands within the current crate and its dependencies should work out of the box with no additional configuration provided that you built ycm with the rust completer flag see the installation section for details for semantic analysis inclusive of the standard library you must have a local copy of the rust source code if using rustup run the following command to download the code rustup component add rust src ycm will find its location automatically otherwise download the archive extract it somewhere and set the following option so ycm can locate it viml in this example the rust source code archive has been extracted to usr local rust rustc 1 20 0 let g ycm rust src path usr local rust rustc 1 20 0 src typescript semantic completion all typescript features are provided by the tsserver engine which is included in the typescript sdk to get the sdk install node js and npm and run the command npm install g typescript tsserver relies on the tsconfig json file to analyze your project ensure the file exists at the root of your project typescript 2 8 1 or later is recommended some features will be missing on older versions you can check which version you are currently using by looking at the output of ycmdebuginfo if the version is none your typescript is too old and should be updated semantic completion for other languages c family c go java javascript python rust and typescript languages are supported natively by youcompleteme using the clang omnisharp gocode godef jdt ls tern jedi racer and tsserver engines respectively check the installation section for instructions to enable these features if desired ycm will use your omnifunc see h omnifunc in vim as a source for semantic completions if it does not have a native semantic completion engine for your files filetype vim comes with okayish omnifuncs for various languages like ruby php etc it depends on the language you can get a stellar omnifunc for ruby with eclim just make sure you have the latest eclim installed and configured this means eclim 2 2 and eclipse 4 2 after installing eclim remember to create a new eclipse project within your application by typing projectcreate path to your project n ruby inside vim and dont forget to have let g eclimcompletionmethod omnifunc in your vimrc this will make ycm and eclim play nice ycm will use eclims omnifuncs as the data source for semantic completions and provide the auto triggering and subsequence based matching and other ycm features on top of it writing new semantic completers you have two options here writing an omnifunc for vims omnicomplete system that ycm will then use through its omni completer or a custom completer for ycm using the completer api here are the differences between the two approaches you have to use vimscript to write the omnifunc but get to use python to write for the completer api this by itself should make you want to use the api the completer api is a much more powerful way to integrate with ycm and it provides a wider set of features for instance you can make your completer query your semantic back end in an asynchronous fashion thus not blocking vims gui thread while your completion system is processing stuff this is impossible with vimscript all of ycms completers use the completer api performance with the completer api is better since python executes faster than vimscript if you want to use the omnifunc system see the relevant vim docs with h complete functions for the completer api see the api docs if you want to upstream your completer into ycms source you should use the completer api diagnostic display ycm will display diagnostic notifications for c family and c languages if you compiled ycm with clang and omnisharp support respectively diagnostics will also be displayed for typescript since ycm continuously recompiles your file as you type youll get notified of errors and warnings in your file as fast as possible here are the various pieces of the diagnostic ui icons show up in the vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted by default a red wavy underline in gvim and a red background in vim moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text vims location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data off by default see options the new diagnostics if any will be displayed the next time you press any key on the keyboard so if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to come in that will not work you need to press some key for the gui to update having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate but cannot be changed due to the way vim internals operate there is no way that a background task can update vims gui after it has finished running you have to press a key this will make ycm check for any pending diagnostics updates you can force a full blocking compilation cycle with the ycmforcecompileanddiagnostics command you may want to map that command to a key try putting nnoremap f5 ycmforcecompileanddiagnostics cr in your vimrc calling this command will force ycm to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the vim gui will be blocked ycm will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the line with the error you can get a detailed diagnostic message with the leader d key mapping can be changed in the options ycm provides when your cursor is on the line with the diagnostic you can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the current file in vims locationlist which can be opened with the lopen and lclose commands make sure you have set let g ycm always populate location list 1 in your vimrc a good way to toggle the display of the locationlist with a single key mapping is provided by another very small vim plugin called listtoggle which also makes it possible to change the height of the locationlist window also written by yours truly diagnostic highlighting groups you can change the styling for the highlighting groups ycm uses for the signs in the vim gutter the relevant groups are ycmerrorsign which falls back to group syntasticerrorsign and then error if they exist ycmwarningsign which falls back to group syntasticwarningsign and then todo if they exist you can also style the line that has the warning error with these groups ycmerrorline which falls back to group syntasticerrorline if it exists ycmwarningline which falls back to group syntasticwarningline if it exists note that the line highlighting groups only work when gutter signs are turned on the syntax groups used to highlight regions of text with errors warnings ycmerrorsection which falls back to group syntasticerror if it exists and then spellbad ycmwarningsection which falls back to group syntasticwarning if it exists and then spellcap heres how youd change the style for a group viml highlight ycmerrorline guibg 3f0000 commands the ycmrestartserver command if the ycmd completion server suddenly stops for some reason you can restart it with this command the ycmforcecompileanddiagnostics command calling this command will force ycm to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the vim gui will be blocked you may want to map this command to a key try putting nnoremap f5 ycmforcecompileanddiagnostics cr in your vimrc the ycmdiags command calling this command will fill vims locationlist with errors or warnings if any were detected in your file and then open it if a given error or warning can be fixed by a call to ycmcompleter fixit then fixit available is appended to the error or warning text see the fixit completer subcommand for more information note the absence of fixit available does not strictly imply a fix it is not available as not all completers are able to provide this indication for example the c sharp completer provides many fix its but does not add this additional indication the g ycm open loclist on ycm diags option can be used to prevent the location list from opening but still have it filled with new diagnostic data see the options section for details the ycmshowdetaileddiagnostic command this command shows the full diagnostic text when the users cursor is on the line with the diagnostic the ycmdebuginfo command this will print out various debug information for the current file useful to see what compile commands will be used for the file if youre using the semantic completion engine the ycmtogglelogs command this command presents the list of logfiles created by ycm the ycmd server and the semantic engine server for the current filetype if any one of these logfiles can be opened in the editor or closed if already open by entering the corresponding number or by clicking on it with the mouse additionally this command can take the logfile names as arguments use the tab key or any other key defined by the wildchar option to complete the arguments or to cycle through them depending on the value of the wildmode option each logfile given as an argument is directly opened or closed if already open in the editor only for debugging purposes the ycmcompleter command this command gives access to a number of additional ide like features in ycm for things like semantic goto type information fixit and refactoring technically the command invokes completer specific commands if the first argument is of the form ft the completer for that file type will be used for example ft cpp else the native completer of the current buffer will be used this command also accepts a range that can either be specified through a selection in one of vims visual modes see h visual use or on the command line for instance 2 5ycmcompleter will apply the command from line 2 to line 5 this is useful for the format subcommand call ycmcompleter without further arguments for a list of the commands you can call for the current completer see the file type feature summary for an overview of the features available for each file type see the ycmcompleter subcommands section for more information on the available subcommands and their usage ycmcompleter subcommands note see the docs for the ycmcompleter command before tackling this section the invoked subcommand is automatically routed to the currently active semantic completer so ycmcompleter gotodefinition will invoke the gotodefinition subcommand on the python semantic completer if the currently active file is a python one and on the clang completer if the currently active file is a c c objective c one you may also want to map the subcommands to something less verbose for instance nnoremap leader jd ycmcompleter goto cr maps the leader jd sequence to the longer subcommand invocation goto commands these commands are useful for jumping around and exploring code when moving the cursor the subcommands add entries to vims jumplist so you can use ctrl o to jump back to where you were before invoking the command and ctrl i to jump forward see h jumplist for details if there is more than one destination the quickfix list see h quickfix is populated with the available locations and opened to full width at the bottom of the screen you can change this behavior by using the ycmquickfixopened autocommand the gotoinclude subcommand looks up the current line for a header and jumps to it supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda the gotodeclaration subcommand looks up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its declaration supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda cs go java python rust typescript the gotodefinition subcommand looks up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its definition note for c family languages this only works in certain situations namely when the definition of the symbol is in the current translation unit a translation unit consists of the file you are editing and all the files you are including with include directives directly or indirectly in that file supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda cs go java javascript python rust typescript the goto subcommand this command tries to perform the most sensible goto operation it can currently this means that it tries to look up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its definition if possible if the definition is not accessible from the current translation unit jumps to the symbols declaration for c c objective c it first tries to look up the current line for a header and jump to it for c implementations are also considered and preferred supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda cs go java javascript python rust typescript the gotoimprecise subcommand warning this command trades correctness for speed same as the goto command except that it doesnt recompile the file with libclang before looking up nodes in the ast this can be very useful when youre editing files that take long to compile but you know that you havent made any changes since the last parse that would lead to incorrect jumps when youre just browsing around your codebase this command can spare you quite a bit of latency supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda the gotoreferences subcommand this command attempts to find all of the references within the project to the identifier under the cursor and populates the quickfix list with those locations supported in filetypes java javascript python typescript the gotoimplementation subcommand looks up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its implementation i e non interface if there are multiple implementations instead provides a list of implementations to choose from supported in filetypes cs the gotoimplementationelsedeclaration subcommand looks up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its implementation if one else jump to its declaration if there are multiple implementations instead provides a list of implementations to choose from supported in filetypes cs the gototype subcommand looks up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to the definition of its type e g if the symbol is an object go to the definition of its class supported in filetypes typescript semantic information commands these commands are useful for finding static information about the code such as the types of variables viewing declarations and documentation strings the gettype subcommand echos the type of the variable or method under the cursor and where it differs the derived type for example c std string s invoking this command on s returns std string std basic string char note causes re parsing of the current translation unit supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda java javascript typescript the gettypeimprecise subcommand warning this command trades correctness for speed same as the gettype command except that it doesnt recompile the file with libclang before looking up nodes in the ast this can be very useful when youre editing files that take long to compile but you know that you havent made any changes since the last parse that would lead to incorrect type when youre just browsing around your codebase this command can spare you quite a bit of latency supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda the getparent subcommand echos the semantic parent of the point under the cursor the semantic parent is the item that semantically contains the given position for example c class c void f void c f in the out of line definition of c f the semantic parent is the class c of which this function is a member in the example above both declarations of c f have c as their semantic context while the lexical context of the first c f is c and the lexical context of the second c f is the translation unit for global declarations the semantic parent is the translation unit note causes re parsing of the current translation unit supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda the getdoc subcommand displays the preview window populated with quick info about the identifier under the cursor depending on the file type this includes things like the type or declaration of identifier doxygen javadoc comments python docstrings etc supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda cs java javascript python typescript rust the getdocimprecise subcommand warning this command trades correctness for speed same as the getdoc command except that it doesnt recompile the file with libclang before looking up nodes in the ast this can be very useful when youre editing files that take long to compile but you know that you havent made any changes since the last parse that would lead to incorrect docs when youre just browsing around your codebase this command can spare you quite a bit of latency supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda refactoring commands these commands make changes to your source code in order to perform refactoring or code correction youcompleteme does not perform any action which cannot be undone and never saves or writes files to the disk the fixit subcommand where available attempts to make changes to the buffer to correct diagnostics on the current line where multiple suggestions are available such as when there are multiple ways to resolve a given warning or where multiple diagnostics are reported for the current line the options are presented and one can be selected completers which provide diagnostics may also provide trivial modifications to the source in order to correct the diagnostic examples include syntax errors such as missing trailing semi colons spurious characters or other errors which the semantic engine can deterministically suggest corrections if no fix it is available for the current line or there is no diagnostic on the current line this command has no effect on the current buffer if any modifications are made the number of changes made to the buffer is echod and the user may use the editors undo command to revert when a diagnostic is available and g ycm echo current diagnostic is set to 1 then the text fixit is appended to the echod diagnostic when the completer is able to add this indication the text fixit available is also appended to the diagnostic text in the output of the ycmdiags command for any diagnostics with available fix its where the completer can provide this indication note causes re parsing of the current translation unit supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda cs java typescript the refactorrename new name subcommand in supported file types this command attempts to perform a semantic rename of the identifier under the cursor this includes renaming declarations definitions and usages of the identifier or any other language appropriate action the specific behavior is defined by the semantic engine in use similar to fixit this command applies automatic modifications to your source files rename operations may involve changes to multiple files which may or may not be open in vim buffers at the time youcompleteme handles all of this for you the behavior is described in the following section supported in filetypes java javascript variables only typescript multi file refactor when a refactor or fixit command touches multiple files youcompleteme attempts to apply those modifications to any existing open visible buffer in the current tab if no such buffer can be found youcompleteme opens the file in a new small horizontal split at the top of the current window applies the change and then hides the window note the buffer remains open and must be manually saved a confirmation dialog is opened prior to doing this to remind you that this is about to happen once the modifications have been made the quickfix list see help quickfix is populated with the locations of all modifications this can be used to review all automatic changes made by using copen typically use the ctrl w enter combination to open the selected file in a new split it is possible to customize how the quickfix window is opened by using the ycmquickfixopened autocommand the buffers are not saved automatically that is you must save the modified buffers manually after reviewing the changes from the quickfix list changes can be undone using vims powerful undo features see help undo note that vims undo is per buffer so to undo all changes the undo commands must be applied in each modified buffer separately note while applying modifications vim may find files which are already open and have a swap file the command is aborted if you select abort or quit in any such prompts this leaves the refactor operation partially complete and must be manually corrected using vims undo features the quickfix list is not populated in this case inspect buffers or equivalent see help buffers to see the buffers that were opened by the command the format subcommand this command formats the whole buffer or some part of it according to the value of the vim options shiftwidth and expandtab see h sw and h et respectively to format a specific part of your document you can either select it in one of vims visual modes see h visual use and run the command or directly enter the range on the command line e g 2 5ycmcompleter format to format it from line 2 to line 5 supported in filetypes java typescript the organizeimports subcommand this command removes unused imports and sorts imports in the current file it can also group imports from the same module in typescript and resolves imports in java supported in filetypes java typescript miscellaneous commands these commands are for general administration rather than ide like features they cover things like the semantic engine server instance and compilation flags the restartserver subcommand restarts the semantic engine as localhost server for those semantic engines that work as separate servers that ycm talks to use this subcommand while editing a file from a javascript project to switch to that project an additional optional argument may be supplied for python specifying the python binary to use to restart the python semantic engine viml ycmcompleter restartserver usr bin python3 4 supported in filetypes cs go java javascript python rust typescript the clearcompilationflagcache subcommand ycm caches the flags it gets from the flagsforfile function in your ycm extra conf py file unless you return them with the do cache parameter set to false it also caches the flags extracted from the compilation database the cache is in memory and is never invalidated unless you restart the server with the ycmrestartserver command this command clears that cache entirely ycm will then re query your flagsforfile function or your compilation database as needed in the future supported in filetypes c cpp objc objcpp cuda the reloadsolution subcommand instruct the omnisharp server to clear its cache and reload all files from disk this is useful when files are added removed or renamed in the solution files are changed outside of vim or whenever omnisharp cache is out of sync supported in filetypes cs functions the youcompleteme geterrorcount function get the number of ycm diagnostic errors if no errors are present this function returns 0 for example viml call youcompleteme geterrorcount both this function and youcompleteme getwarningcount can be useful when integrating ycm with other vim plugins for example a lightline user could add a diagnostics section to their statusline which would display the number of errors and warnings the youcompleteme getwarningcount function get the number of ycm diagnostic warnings if no warnings are present this function returns 0 for example viml call youcompleteme getwarningcount autocommands the ycmlocationopened autocommand this user autocommand is fired when ycm opens the location list window in response to the ycmdiags command by default the location list window is opened to the bottom of the current window and its height is set to fit all entries this behavior can be overridden by using the ycmlocationopened autocommand which is triggered while the cursor is in the location list window for instance viml function s customizeycmlocationwindow move the window to the top of the screen wincmd k set the window height to 5 5wincmd switch back to working window wincmd p endfunction autocmd user ycmlocationopened call s customizeycmlocationwindow the ycmquickfixopened autocommand this user autocommand is fired when ycm opens the quickfix window in response to the goto and refactorrename subcommands by default the quickfix window is opened to full width at the bottom of the screen and its height is set to fit all entries this behavior can be overridden by using the ycmquickfixopened autocommand which is triggered while the cursor is in the quickfix window for instance viml function s customizeycmquickfixwindow move the window to the top of the screen wincmd k set the window height to 5 5wincmd endfunction autocmd user ycmquickfixopened call s customizeycmquickfixwindow options all options have reasonable defaults so if the plug in works after installation you dont need to change any options these options can be configured in your vimrc script by including a line like this viml let g ycm min num of chars for completion 1 note that after changing an option in your vimrc script you have to restart ycmd with the ycmrestartserver command for the changes to take effect the g ycm min num of chars for completion option this option controls the number of characters the user needs to type before identifier based completion suggestions are triggered for example if the option is set to 2 then when the user types a second alphanumeric character after a whitespace character completion suggestions will be triggered this option is not used for semantic completion setting this option to a high number like 99 effectively turns off the identifier completion engine and just leaves the semantic engine default 2 viml let g ycm min num of chars for completion 2 the g ycm min num identifier candidate chars option this option controls the minimum number of characters that a completion candidate coming from the identifier completer must have to be shown in the popup menu a special value of 0 means there is no limit note this option only applies to the identifier completer it has no effect on the various semantic completers default 0 viml let g ycm min num identifier candidate chars 0 the g ycm max num candidates option this option controls the maximum number of semantic completion suggestions shown in the completion menu this only applies to suggestions from semantic completion engines see the g ycm max identifier candidates option to limit the number of suggestions from the identifier based engine a special value of 0 means there is no limit note setting this option to 0 or to a value greater than 100 is not recommended as it will slow down completion when there are a very large number of suggestions default 50 viml let g ycm max num candidates 50 the g ycm max num identifier candidates option this option controls the maximum number of completion suggestions from the identifier based engine shown in the completion menu a special value of 0 means there is no limit note setting this option to 0 or to a value greater than 100 is not recommended as it will slow down completion when there are a very large number of suggestions default 10 viml let g ycm max num identifier candidates 10 the g ycm auto trigger option when set to 0 this option turns off ycms identifier completer the as you type popup and the semantic triggers the popup youd get after typing or in say c you can still force semantic completion with the c space shortcut if you want to just turn off the identifier completer but keep the semantic triggers you should set g ycm min num of chars for completion to a high number like 99 default 1 viml let g ycm auto trigger 1 the g ycm filetype whitelist option this option controls for which vim filetypes see h filetype should ycm be turned on the option value should be a vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings like python cpp etc and values being unimportant the dictionary is used like a hash set meaning that only the keys matter the key is special and matches all filetypes by default the whitelist contains only this key ycm also has a g ycm filetype blacklist option that lists filetypes for which ycm shouldnt be turned on ycm will work only in filetypes that both the whitelist and the blacklist allow the blacklist allows a filetype by not having it as a key for example lets assume you want ycm to work in files with the cpp filetype the filetype should then be present in the whitelist either directly cpp key in the whitelist or indirectly through the special key it should not be present in the blacklist filetypes that are blocked by the either of the lists will be completely ignored by ycm meaning that neither the identifier based completion engine nor the semantic engine will operate in them you can get the filetype of the current file in vim with set ft default 1 viml let g ycm filetype whitelist 1 the g ycm filetype blacklist option this option controls for which vim filetypes see h filetype should ycm be turned off the option value should be a vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings like python cpp etc and values being unimportant the dictionary is used like a hash set meaning that only the keys matter see the g ycm filetype whitelist option for more details on how this works default see next line viml let g ycm filetype blacklist \ tagbar 1 \ qf 1 \ notes 1 \ markdown 1 \ unite 1 \ text 1 \ vimwiki 1 \ pandoc 1

option value should be a vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings like python cpp etc and values being unimportant the dictionary is used like a hash set meaning that only the keys matter the listed filetypes will be ignored by the ycm semantic completion engine but the identifier based completion engine will still trigger in files of those filetypes note that even if semantic completion is not turned off for a specific filetype you will not get semantic completion if the semantic engine does not support that filetype you can get the filetype of the current file in vim with set ft

diagnostic display section in the user manual for more details specific parts of the diagnostics ui like the gutter signs text highlighting diagnostic echo and auto location list population can be individually turned on or off see the other options below for details note that ycms diagnostics ui is only supported for c family languages when set this option also makes ycm remove all syntastic checkers set for the c cpp objc objcpp and cuda filetypes since this would conflict with ycms own diagnostics ui if youre using ycms identifier completer in c family languages but cannot use the clang

syntastic enable highlighting option before using this options default default 1 viml let g ycm enable diagnostic highlighting 1 the g ycm echo current diagnostic option when this option is set ycm will echo the text of the diagnostic present on the current line when you move your cursor to that line if a fixit is available for the current diagnostic then fixit is appended this option is part of the syntastic compatibility layer if the option is not set ycm will fall back to the value of the g syntastic echo current error option before using this options default default 1 viml let g ycm echo current diagnostic 1 the g ycm filter diagnostics option this option controls which diagnostics will be rendered by ycm this option holds a dictionary of key values where the keys are vims filetype strings delimited by commas and values are dictionaries describing the filter a filter is a dictionary of key values where the keys are the type of filter and the value is a list of arguments to that filter in the case of just a single item in the list you may omit the brackets and just provide the argument directly if any filter matches a diagnostic it will be dropped and ycm will not render it the following filter types are supported regex accepts a string regular expression this type matches when the regex treated as case insensitive is found in the diagnostic text level accepts a string level either warning or error this type matches when the diagnostic has the same level note the regex syntax is not vims its pythons default viml let g ycm filter diagnostics \ java \ regex taco \ level error \ \ \ the g ycm always populate location list option when this option is set ycm will populate the location list automatically every time it gets new diagnostic data this option is off by default so as not to interfere with other data you might have placed in the location list see help location list in vim to learn more about the location list this option is part of the syntastic compatibility layer if the option is not set ycm will fall back to the value of the g syntastic always populate loc list option before using this options default default 0 viml let g ycm always populate location list 0 the g ycm open loclist on ycm diags option when this option is set ycmdiags will automatically open the location list after forcing a compilation and filling the list with diagnostic data see help location list in vim to learn more about the location list default 1 viml let g ycm open loclist on ycm diags 1 the g ycm complete in comments option when this option is set to 1 ycm will show the completion menu even when typing inside comments default 0 viml let g ycm complete in comments 0 the g ycm complete in strings option when this option is set to 1 ycm will show the completion menu even when typing inside strings note that this is turned on by default so that you can use the filename completion inside strings this is very useful for instance in c family files where typing include will trigger the start of filename completion if you turn off this option you will turn off filename completion in such situations as well default 1 viml let g ycm complete in strings 1 the g ycm collect identifiers from comments and strings option when this option is set to 1 ycms identifier completer will also collect identifiers from strings and comments otherwise the text in comments and strings will be ignored default 0 viml let g ycm collect identifiers from comments and strings 0 the g ycm collect identifiers from tags files option when this option is set to 1 ycms identifier completer will also collect identifiers from tags files the list of tags files to examine is retrieved from the tagfiles vim function which examines the tags vim option see h tags for details ycm will re index your tags files if it detects that they have been modified the only supported tag format is the exuberant ctags format the format from plain ctags is not supported ctags needs to be called with the fields l option thats a lowercase l not a one because ycm needs the language lang field in the tags output see the faq for pointers if ycm does not appear to read your tag files this option is off by default because it makes vim slower if your tags are on a network directory default 0 viml let g ycm collect identifiers from tags files 0 the g ycm seed identifiers with syntax option when this option is set to 1 ycms identifier completer will seed its identifier database with the keywords of the programming language youre writing since the keywords are extracted from the vim syntax file for the filetype all keywords may not be collected depending on how the syntax file was written usually at least 95 of the keywords are successfully extracted default 0 viml let g ycm seed identifiers with syntax 0 the g ycm extra conf vim data option if youre using semantic completion for c family files this option might come handy its a way of sending data from vim to your flagsforfile function in your ycm extra conf py file this option is supposed to be a list of vimscript expression strings that are evaluated for every request to the ycmd server and then passed to your flagsforfile function as a client data keyword argument for instance if you set this option to v version your flagsforfile function will be called like this python the 704 value is of course contingent on vim 7 4 in 7 3 it would be 703 flagsforfile filename client data v version 704 so the client data parameter is a dictionary mapping vim expression strings to their values at the time of the request the correct way to define parameters for your flagsforfile function python def flagsforfile filename kwargs you can then get to client data with kwargs client data default viml let g ycm extra conf vim data the g ycm server python interpreter option ycm will by default search for an appropriate python interpreter on your system you can use this option to override that behavior and force the use of a specific interpreter of your choosing note this interpreter is only used for the ycmd server the ycm client running inside vim always uses the python interpreter thats embedded inside vim default viml let g ycm server python interpreter the g ycm keep logfiles option when this option is set to 1 ycm and the ycmd completion server will keep the logfiles around after shutting down they are deleted on shutdown by default to see where the logfiles are call ycmdebuginfo default 0 viml let g ycm keep logfiles 0 the g ycm log level option the logging level that ycm and the ycmd completion server use valid values are the following from most verbose to least verbose debug info warning error critical note that debug is very verbose default info viml let g ycm log level info the g ycm auto start csharp server option when set to 1 the omnisharp server will be automatically started once per vim session when you open a c file default 1 viml let g ycm auto start csharp server 1 the g ycm auto stop csharp server option when set to 1 the omnisharp server will be automatically stopped upon closing vim default 1 viml let g ycm auto stop csharp server 1 the g ycm csharp server port option when g ycm auto start csharp server is set to 1 specifies the port for the omnisharp server to listen on when set to 0 uses an unused port provided by the os default 0 viml let g ycm csharp server port 0 the g ycm csharp insert namespace expr option by default when ycm inserts a namespace it will insert the using statement under the nearest using statement you may prefer that the using statement is inserted somewhere for example to preserve sorting if so you can set this option to override this behavior when this option is set instead of inserting the using statement itself ycm will set the global variable g ycm namespace to insert to the namespace to insert and then evaluate this options value as an expression the options expression is responsible for inserting the namespace the default insertion will not occur default viml let g ycm csharp insert namespace expr the g ycm add preview to completeopt option when this option is set to 1 ycm will add the preview string to vims completeopt option see h completeopt if your completeopt option already has preview set there will be no effect you can see the current state of your completeopt setting with set completeopt yes the question mark is important when preview is present in completeopt ycm will use the preview window at the top of the file to store detailed information about the current completion candidate but only if the candidate came from the semantic engine for instance it would show the full function prototype and all the function overloads in the window if the current completion is a function name default 0 viml let g ycm add preview to completeopt 0 the g ycm autoclose preview window after completion option when this option is set to 1 ycm will auto close the preview window after the user accepts the offered completion string if there is no preview window triggered because there is no preview string in completeopt this option is irrelevant see the g ycm add preview to completeopt option for more details default 0 viml let g ycm autoclose preview window after completion 0 the g ycm autoclose preview window after insertion option when this option is set to 1 ycm will auto close the preview window after the user leaves insert mode this option is irrelevant if g ycm autoclose preview window after completion is set or if no preview window is triggered see the g ycm add preview to completeopt option for more details default 0 viml let g ycm autoclose preview window after insertion 0 the g ycm max diagnostics to display option this option controls the maximum number of diagnostics shown to the user when errors or warnings are detected in the file this option is only relevant if you are using the c family semantic completion engine default 30 viml let g ycm max diagnostics to display 30 the g ycm key list select completion option this option controls the key mappings used to select the first completion string invoking any of them repeatedly cycles forward through the completion list some users like adding enter to this list default tab down viml let g ycm key list select completion tab down the g ycm key list previous completion option this option controls the key mappings used to select the previous completion string invoking any of them repeatedly cycles backwards through the completion list note that one of the defaults is s tab which means shift tab that mapping will probably only work in gui vim gvim or macvim and not in plain console vim because the terminal usually does not forward modifier key combinations to vim default s tab up viml let g ycm key list previous completion s tab up the g ycm key list stop completion option this option controls the key mappings used to close the completion menu this is useful when the menu is blocking the view when you need to insert the tab character or when you want to expand a snippet from ultisnips and navigate through it default c y viml let g ycm key list stop completion c y the g ycm key invoke completion option this option controls the key mapping used to invoke the completion menu for semantic completion by default semantic completion is triggered automatically after typing and in insert mode if semantic completion support has been compiled in this key mapping can be used to trigger semantic completion anywhere useful for searching for top level functions and classes console vim not gvim or macvim passes nul to vim when the user types c space so ycm will make sure that nul is used in the map command when youre editing in console vim and c space in gui vim this means that you can just press c space in both console and gui vim and ycm will do the right thing setting this option to an empty string will make sure no mapping is created default c space viml let g ycm key invoke completion c space the g ycm key detailed diagnostics option this option controls the key mapping used to show the full diagnostic text when the users cursor is on the line with the diagnostic it basically calls ycmshowdetaileddiagnostic setting this option to an empty string will make sure no mapping is created default leader d viml let g ycm key detailed diagnostics leader d the g ycm global ycm extra conf option normally ycm searches for a ycm extra conf py file for compilation flags see the user guide for more details on how this works this option specifies a fallback path to a config file which is used if no ycm extra conf py is found you can place such a global file anywhere in your filesystem default viml let g ycm global ycm extra conf the g ycm confirm extra conf option when this option is set to 1 ycm will ask once per ycm extra conf py file if it is safe to be loaded this is to prevent execution of malicious code from a ycm extra conf py file you didnt write to selectively get ycm to ask not ask about loading certain ycm extra conf py files see the g ycm extra conf globlist option default 1 viml let g ycm confirm extra conf 1 the g ycm extra conf globlist option this option is a list that may contain several globbing patterns if a pattern starts with a all ycm extra conf py files matching that pattern will be blacklisted that is they wont be loaded and no confirmation dialog will be shown if a pattern does not start with a all files matching that pattern will be whitelisted note that this option is not used when confirmation is disabled using g ycm confirm extra conf and that items earlier in the list will take precedence over the later ones rules matches everything matches any single character seq matches any character in seq seq matches any char not in seq example viml let g ycm extra conf globlist dev the first rule will match everything contained in the dev directory so ycm extra conf py files from there will be loaded the second rule will match everything in the home directory so a ycm extra conf py file from there wont be loaded as the first rule takes precedence everything in the home directory excluding the dev directory will be blacklisted note the glob pattern is first expanded with pythons os path expanduser and then resolved with os path abspath before being matched against the filename default viml let g ycm extra conf globlist the g ycm filepath completion use working dir option by default ycms filepath completion will interpret relative paths like as being relative to the folder of the file of the currently active buffer setting this option will force ycm to always interpret relative paths as being relative to vims current working directory default 0 viml let g ycm filepath completion use working dir 0 the g ycm semantic triggers option this option controls the character based triggers for the various semantic completion engines the option holds a dictionary of key values where the keys are vims filetype strings delimited by commas and values are lists of strings where the strings are the triggers setting key value pairs on the dictionary adds semantic triggers to the internal default set listed below you cannot remove the default triggers only add new ones a trigger is a sequence of one or more characters that trigger semantic completion when typed for instance c cpp filetype has listed as a trigger so when the user types foo the semantic engine will trigger and serve foos list of member functions and variables since c also has listed as a trigger the same thing would happen when the user typed foo its also possible to use a regular expression as a trigger you have to prefix your trigger with re to signify its a regex trigger for instance re \w \ would only trigger after the \w \ regex matches note the regex syntax is not vims its pythons default see next line viml let g ycm semantic triggers \ c \ objc re \ a za z \w \s re \s \w\d \w \s \ re \ \ \s \ ocaml \ cpp cuda objcpp \ perl \ php \ cs java javascript typescript d python perl6 scala vb elixir go \ ruby \ lua \ erlang \ the g ycm cache omnifunc option some omnicompletion engines do not work well with the ycm cache—in particular they might not produce all possible results for a given prefix by unsetting this option you can ensure that the omnicompletion engine is re queried on every keypress that will ensure all completions will be presented but might cause stuttering and lagginess if the omnifunc is slow default 1 viml let g ycm cache omnifunc 1 the g ycm use ultisnips completer option by default ycm will query the ultisnips plugin for possible completions of snippet triggers this option can turn that behavior off default 1 viml let g ycm use ultisnips completer 1 the g ycm goto buffer command option defines where goto commands result should be opened can take one of the following values same buffer horizontal split vertical split new tab new or existing tab if this option is set to the same buffer but current buffer can not be switched when buffer is modified and nohidden option is set then result will be opened in horizontal split default same buffer viml let g ycm goto buffer command same buffer the g ycm disable for files larger than kb option defines the max size in kb for a file to be considered for completion if this option is set to 0 then no check is made on the size of the file youre opening default 1000 viml let g ycm disable for files larger than kb 1000 the g ycm python binary path option this option specifies the python interpreter to use to run the jedi completion library specify the python interpreter to use to get completions by default the python under which ycmd runs is used ycmd runs on python 2 7 1 or 3 4 default viml let g ycm python binary path python note the settings above will make ycm use the first python executable found through the path faq i used to be able to import vim in ycm extra conf py but now cant ycm was rewritten to use a client server architecture where most of the logic is in the ycmd server so the magic vim module you could have previously imported in your ycm extra conf py files doesnt exist anymore to be fair importing the magic vim module in extra conf files was never supported in the first place it only ever worked by accident and was never a part of the extra conf api but fear not you should be able to tweak your extra conf files to continue working by using the g ycm extra conf vim data option see the docs on that option for details i get importerror exceptions that mention pyinit ycm core or initycm core these errors are caused by building the ycm native libraries for python 2 and trying to load them into a python 3 process or the other way around for instance if building for python 2 but loading in python 3 importerror dynamic module does not define init function pyinit ycm core if building for python 3 but loading in python 2 importerror dynamic module does not define init function initycm core setting the g ycm server python interpreter option to force the use of a specific python interpreter for ycmd is usually the easiest way to solve the problem common values for that option are usr bin python and usr bin python3 i get a linker warning regarding libpython on mac when compiling ycm if the warning is ld warning path usr lib libpython2 7 dylib following l not a directory then feel free to ignore it its caused by a limitation of cmake and is not an issue everything should still work fine i get a weird window at the top of my file when i use the semantic engine this is vims preview window vim uses it to show you extra information about something if such information is available ycm provides vim with such extra information for instance when you select a function in the completion list the preview window will hold that functions prototype and the prototypes of any overloads of the function it will stay there after you select the completion so that you can use the information about the parameters and their types to write the function call if you would like this window to auto close after you select a completion string set the g ycm autoclose preview window after completion option to 1 in your vimrc file similarly the g ycm autoclose preview window after insertion option can be set to close the preview window after leaving insert mode if you dont want this window to ever show up add set completeopt preview to your vimrc also make sure that the g ycm add preview to completeopt option is set to 0 it appears that ycm is not working in vim run messages and carefully read the output ycm will echo messages to the message log if it encounters problems its likely you misconfigured something and ycm is complaining about it also you may want to run the ycmdebuginfo command it will make ycm spew out various debugging information including the ycm and ycmd logfile paths and the compile flags for the current file if the file is a c family language file and you have compiled in clang support logfiles can be opened in the editor using the ycmtogglelogs command sometimes it takes much longer to get semantic completions than normal this means that libclang which ycm uses for c family semantic completion failed to pre compile your files preamble in other words there was an error compiling some of the source code you pulled in through your header files i suggest calling the ycmdiags command to see what they were bottom line if libclang cant pre compile your files preamble because there were errors in it youre going to get slow completions because theres no ast cache ycm auto inserts completion strings i dont want if this happens when vim automatically wraps text then its a vim bug that has been fixed in version 8 0 0127 update your vim to this version or later this could also be some mappings that interfere with ycms internal ones make sure you dont have something mapped to c p c x or c u in insert mode ycm never selects something for you it just shows you a menu and the user has to explicitly select something if something is being selected automatically this means theres a bug or a misconfiguration somewhere i get a e227 mapping already exists for blah error when i start vim this means that ycm tried to set up a key mapping but failed because you already had something mapped to that key combination the blah part of the message will tell you what was the key combination that failed look in the options section and see if any of the default mappings conflict with your own then change that option value to something else so that the conflict goes away i get glibc 2 xx not found required by libclang so when starting vim your system is too old for the precompiled binaries from llvm org compile clang on your machine and then link against the libclang so you just produced see the full installation guide for help im trying to use a homebrew vim with ycm and im getting segfaults something i dont know what is wrong with the way that homebrew configures and builds vim i recommend using macvim even if you dont like the macvim gui you can use the vim binary that is inside the macvim app package its macvim app contents macos vim and get the vim console experience i have a homebrew python and or macvim cant compile sigabrt when starting you should probably run brew rm python brew install python to get the latest fixes that should make ycm work with such a configuration also rebuild macvim then if you still get problems with this see issue 18 for suggestions i get long bit definition appears wrong for platform when compiling look at the output of your cmake call there should be a line in it like the following with dylib in place of so on a mac found pythonlibs usr lib libpython2 7 so required is at least version 2 5 that would be the correct output an example of incorrect output would be the following found pythonlibs usr lib libpython2 7 so found suitable version 2 5 1 minimum required is 2 5 notice how theres an extra bit of output there the found suitable version version part where version is not the same as the version of the dynamic library in the example shown the library is version 2 7 but the second string is version 2 5 1 this means that cmake found one version of python headers and a different version for the library this is wrong it can happen when you have multiple versions of python installed on your machine you should probably add the following flags to your cmake call again dylib instead of so on a mac dpython include dir usr include python2 7 dpython library usr lib libpython2 7 so this will force the paths to the python include directory and the python library to use you may need to set these flags to something else but you need to make sure you use the same version of python that your vim binary is built against which is highly likely to be the systems default python i get libpython2 7 a relocation r x86 64 32 when compiling the error is usually encountered when compiling ycm on centos or rhel the full error looks something like the following usr bin ld usr local lib libpython2 7 a abstract o relocation r x86 64 32 against a local symbol can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fpic its possible to get a slightly different error thats similar to the one above heres the problem and how you solve it your libpython2 7 a was not compiled with fpic so it cant be linked into ycm core so use the dpython library cmake flag to point it to a so version of libpython on your machine for instance dpython library usr lib libpython2 7 so naturally this means youll have to go through the full installation guide by hand i get vim caught deadly signal segv on vim startup this can happen on some linux distros if you encounter this situation run vim under gdb youll probably see something like this in the output when vim crashes undefined symbol clang compilecommands dispose this means that vim is trying to load a libclang so that is too old you need at least a 3 9 libclang just go through the installation guide and make sure you are using a correct libclang so we recommend downloading prebuilt binaries from llvm org i get fatal python error pythreadstate get no current thread on startup this is caused by linking a static version of libpython into ycmds ycm core so this leads to multiple copies of the python interpreter loaded when python loads ycmd core so and this messes up pythons global state the details arent important the solution is that the version of python linked and run against must be built with either enable shared or enable framework on os x this is achieved as follows note for mac replace enable shared with enable framework when building python from source configure enable shared options when building python from pyenv python configure opts enable shared pyenv install version install py says python must be compiled with enable framework wat see the previous answer for how to ensure your python is built to support dynamic modules ycm does not read identifiers from my tags files first put let g ycm collect identifiers from tags files 1 in your vimrc make sure you are using exuberant ctags to produce your tags files since the only supported tag format is the exuberant ctags format the format from plain ctags is not supported the output of ctags version should list exuberant ctags see universal ctags for a maintained version ctags needs to be called with the fields l thats a lowercase l not a one option because ycm needs the language lang field in the tags output note exuberant ctags by default sets language tag for h files as c if you have c not c project consider giving parameter langmap c c h to ctags to see tags from h files note mac os x comes with plain ctags installed by default brew install ctags will get you the exuberant ctags version also make sure that your vim tags option is set correctly see h tags for details if you want to see which tag files ycm will read for a given buffer run echo tagfiles with the relevant buffer active note that that function will only list tag files that already exist ctrl u in insert mode does not work while the completion menu is visible ycm uses completefunc completion mode to show suggestions and vim disables c u in that mode as a feature sadly theres nothing i can do about this my ctrl r mapping does not work while the completion menu is visible vim prevents remapping of the c r key in all c x completion modes except the c x c n c x c p mode which operates in the same mode as c n c p and ycm uses the c x c u completefunc mode for completions this means that adding c r to any of the g ycm key list options has no effect you need to use another key ycm conflicts with ultisnips tab key usage ycm comes with support for ultisnips snippet suggestions in the popup menu but youll have to change the ultisnips mappings see h ultisnips triggers in vim for details youll probably want to change some all of the following options viml g ultisnipsexpandtrigger g ultisnipsjumpforwardtrigger g ultisnipsjumpbackwardtrigger snippets added with ultisnipsaddfiletypes do not appear in the popup menu for efficiency ycm only fetches ultisnips snippets in specific scenarios like visiting a buffer or setting its filetype you can force ycm to retrieve them by manually triggering the filetype autocommand viml doautocmd filetype why isnt ycm just written in plain vimscript ffs because of the identifier completion engine and subsequence based filtering lets say you have many dozens of files open in a single vim instance i often do the identifier based engine then needs to store thousands if not tens of thousands of identifiers in its internal data structures when the user types ycm needs to perform subsequence based filtering on all of those identifiers every single one in less than 10 milliseconds im sorry but that level of performance is just plain impossible to achieve with vimscript ive tried and the language is just too slow no you cant get acceptable performance even if you limit yourself to just the identifiers in the current file and simple prefix based filtering why does ycm demand such a recent version of vim ycm needs a version of vim with the timers feature to achieve full asynchronicity this feature is available since vim 7 4 1578 nasty bugs happen if i have the vim autoclose plugin installed use the delimitmate plugin instead it does the same thing without conflicting with ycm is there some sort of ycm mailing list i have questions if you have questions about the plugin or need help please use the ycm users mailing list dont create issues on the tracker the tracker is for bug reports and feature requests i get an internal compiler error when installing this can be a problem on virtual servers with limited memory a possible solution is to add more swap memory a more practical solution would be to force the build script to run only one compile job at a time you can do this by setting the ycm cores environment variable to 1 example ycm cores 1 install py clang completer i get weird errors when i press ctrl c in vim never use ctrl c in vim using ctrl c to exit insert mode in vim is a bad idea the main issue here is that ctrl c in vim doesnt just leave insert mode it leaves it without triggering insertleave autocommands as per vim docs this is a bad idea and is likely to break many other things and not just ycm bottom line if you use ctrl c to exit insert mode in vim youre gonna have a bad time if pressing esc is too annoying agreed it is we suggest mapping it to something more convenient on a qwerty keyboard a good pick for the esc map is inoremap jk esc this is right on the home row its an incredibly rare digraph in english and if you ever need to type those two chars in sequence in insert mode you just type j then wait 500ms then type k why did ycm stop using syntastic for diagnostics display previously ycm would send any diagnostics it would receive from the libclang semantic engine to syntastic for display as signs in the gutter red squiggles etc today ycm uses its own code to do that using syntastic for this was always a kludge syntastic assumes its checker plugins behave in a certain way those assumptions have never fit ycm for instance ycm continuously recompiles your code in the background for c family languages and tries to push new diagnostics to the user as fast as possible even while the user types syntastic assumes that a checker only runs on file save active mode or even less frequently when the user explicitly invokes it passive mode this mismatch in assumptions causes performance problems since syntastic code isnt optimized for this use case of constant diagnostic refreshing poor support for this use case also led to crash bugs in vim caused by syntastic vim interactions issue 593 and other problems like random vim flickering attempts were made to resolve these issues in syntastic but ultimately some of them failed for various reasons implementing diagnostic display code directly in ycm resolves all of these problems performance also improved substantially since the relevant code is now written in python instead of vimscript which is very slow and is tailored only for ycms use cases we were also able to introduce new features in this area since were now not limited to the syntastic checker api weve tried to implement this in the most backwards compatible way possible ycm options that control diagnostic display fall back to syntastic options that control the same concepts if the user has those set still some syntastic specific configuration you might have had might not be supported by the new code please file issues on the tracker in such cases if we find the request to be reasonable well find a way to address it completion doesnt work with the c standard library headers this is caused by an issue with libclang that only affects some operating systems compiling with clang the binary will use the correct default header search paths but compiling with libclang so which ycm uses does not mac os x is normally affected but theres a workaround in ycm for that specific os if youre not running that os but still have the same problem continue reading the workaround is to call echo clang v e x c and look at the paths under the include search starts here heading you should take those paths prepend isystem to each individual path and append them all to the list of flags you return from your flagsforfile function in your ycm extra conf py file see issue 303 for details when i open a javascript file i get an annoying warning about tern project file take a look at the instructions for using the javascript completer if this is still really annoying and you have a good reason not to have a tern project file create an empty tern config file in your home directory and ycm will stop complaining when i start vim i get a runtime error saying r6034 an application has made an attempt to load the c runtime library incorrectly cmake and other things seem to screw up the path with their own msvcrxx dll versions add the following to the very top of your vimrc to remove these entries from the path python python eof import os import re path os environ path split def contains msvcr lib folder try for item in os listdir folder if re match rmsvcr\d dll item return true except pass return false path folder for folder in path if not contains msvcr lib folder os environ path join path eof i hear that ycm only supports python 2 is that true no both the vim client and the ycmd server run on python 2 or 3 if you work on a python 3 project you may need to set g ycm python binary path to the python interpreter you use for your project to get completions for that version of python on windows i get e887 sorry this command is disabled the pythons site module could not be loaded if you are running vim on windows with python 2 7 11 this is likely caused by a bug follow this workaround or use a different version python 2 7 12 does not suffer from the bug i cant complete python packages in a virtual environment this means that the python used to run jedihttp is not the python of the virtual environment youre in to resolve this you either set g ycm python binary path to the absolute path of the python binary in your virtual environment or since virtual environment will put that python executable first in your path when the virtual environment is active then if you set g ycm python binary path to just python it will be found as the first python and used to run jedihttp i want to defer loading of youcompleteme until after vim finishes booting in recent versions of vim you can install ycm in a folder under vim pack opt and then load it once the user is idle via an autocommand viml augroup load ycm autocmd autocmd cursorhold cursorholdi packadd youcompleteme \ autocmd load ycm augroup end ycm does not shut down when i quit vim ycm relies on the vimleave event to shut down the ycmd server some plugins prevent this event from triggering by exiting vim through an autocommand without using the nested keyword see h autocmd nested one of these plugins is vim nerdtree tabs you should identify which plugin is responsible for the issue and report it to the plugin author note that when this happens ycmd will automatically shut itself down after 30 minutes ycm does not work with my anaconda python setup anaconda is often incompatible with the pre built libclang used by ycm and therefore is not supported the recommended way to solve this is to run path to real python install py for example usr bin python install py if you want completion in anaconda projects
