driven programming event driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions sensor outputs or messages from other programs threads functional programming functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data functional reactive programming frp frp is a programming paradigm for asynchronous dataflow programming using the building blocks of functional programming compatibility ability of a product to work with different input output devices and rendering software including printers email mobile devices and different browsers cross browser cross browser refers to the ability of a website web application html construct or client side script to function in environments that provide its required features and to bow out or degrade gracefully when features are absent or lacking e mail preparing html based electronic mail keyboard working with keyboard input in a web browser mobile development of websites optimized for viewing on smartphone and tablet devices printers manipulation of printer output through css responsive web design rwd rwd responds to the needs of the users and the devices theyre using the layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device web accessibility web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive understand navigate and interact with the web and that they can contribute to the web ecosystem important developers companies organizations and news sources communities around projects successful open source projects attract many developers who produce plugins libraries tutorials and other resources this section collects such resources news websites newsletters which provide daily and weekly news related to frontend web development notable community members important engineers evangelists architects and other celebrities organizations commercial companies and nonprofit organizations around web development podcasts a podcast is a form of digital media that consists of an episodic series of audio video digital radio pdf or epub files subscribed to and downloaded automatically through web syndication or streamed online to a computer or mobile device languages protocols browser apis programming mark up languages and web related standards cascading style sheets css css are a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in html or xml it describes how elements should

websites it is defined by ecmascript standard javascript object notation json json javascript object notation is a lightweight data interchange format it is easy for humans to read and write it is easy for machines to parse and generate it is based on a subset of the javascript programming language scalable vector graphics svg an xml based vector image format for two dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation service workers a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline templating languages and engines template engines are tools to separate program logic and presentation into two independent parts this makes the development of both logic and presentation easier improves flexibility and eases modification and maintenance transpiled languages abstract languages converted to native browser supported standards like javascript or css uniform resource identifier uri uri is a string of characters used to identify a resource the most common form of uri is the uniform resource locator url web animations api web animations is a new javascript api for driving animated content on the web by unifying the animation features of svg and css web animations unlocks features previously only usable declaratively and exposes powerful high performance animation capabilities to developers webassembly webassembly is meant to fill a place that javascript has been forced to occupy up to now a low level code representation that can serve as a compiler target user interface components drop in ui components for web sites and applications buttons the term button refers to any graphical control element that provides the user a simple way to trigger an event like searching for a query at a search engine or to interact with dialog boxes like confirming an action code code viewers and editors designed for embedding inside a website forms a
