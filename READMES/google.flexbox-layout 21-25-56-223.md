flexboxlayout flexboxlayout is a library project which brings the similar capabilities of css flexible box layout module to android installation add the following dependency to your build gradle file dependencies implementation com google android flexbox 1 0 0 usage there are two ways of using flexbox in your layout flexboxlayout the first one is flexboxlayout that extends the viewgroup like linearlayout and relativelayout you can specify the attributes from a layout xml like xml textview android id id textview1 android layout width 120dp android layout height 80dp app layout flexbasispercent 50 textview android id id textview2 android layout width 80dp android layout height 80dp app layout alignself center textview android id id textview3 android layout width 160dp android layout height 80dp app layout alignself flex end or from code like java flexboxlayout flexboxlayout flexboxlayout findviewbyid r id flexbox layout flexboxlayout setflexdirection flexdirection row view view flexboxlayout getchildat 0 flexboxlayout layoutparams lp flexboxlayout layoutparams view getlayoutparams lp order 1 lp flexgrow 2 view setlayoutparams lp flexboxlayoutmanager within recyclerview the second one is flexboxlayoutmanager that can be used within recyclerview java recyclerview recyclerview recyclerview context findviewbyid r id recyclerview flexboxlayoutmanager layoutmanager new flexboxlayoutmanager context layoutmanager setflexdirection flexdirection column layoutmanager setjustifycontent justifycontent flex end recyclerview setlayoutmanager layoutmanager or for the attributes for the children of the flexboxlayoutmanager you can do like java mimageview setimagedrawable drawable viewgroup layoutparams lp mimageview getlayoutparams if lp instanceof flexboxlayoutmanager layoutparams flexboxlayoutmanager layoutparams flexboxlp flexboxlayoutmanager layoutparams lp flexboxlp setflexgrow 1 0f flexboxlp setalignself alignself flex end the advantage of using flexboxlayoutmanager is that it recycles the views that go off the screen for reuse for the views that are appearing as the user scrolls instead of inflating every individual view which consumes much less memory especially when the number of items contained in the flexbox container is large supported attributes features comparison due to some characteristics of recyclerview some flexbox attributes are not available not implemented to the flexboxlayoutmanager here is a quick overview of the attributes features comparison between the two implementations attribute feature flexboxlayout flexboxlayoutmanager recyclerview flexdirection flexwrap except wrap reverse justifycontent alignitems aligncontent layout order layout flexgrow layout flexshrink layout alignself layout flexbasispercent layout min max width layout min max height layout wrapbefore divider view recycling scrolling 1 1 partially possible by wrapping it with scrollview but it isnt likely to work with a large set of views inside the layout because it doesnt consider view recycling supported attributes attributes for the flexboxlayout flexdirection this attribute determines the direction of the main axis and the cross axis perpendicular to the main axis the direction children items are placed inside the flexbox layout possible values are row default row reverse column column reverse flexwrap this attribute controls whether the flex container is single line or multi line and the direction of the cross axis possible values are nowrap default wrap wrap reverse justifycontent this attribute controls the alignment along the main axis possible values are flex start default flex end center space between space around alignitems this attribute controls the alignment along the cross axis possible values are stretch default flex start flex end center baseline aligncontent this attribute controls the alignment of the flex lines in the flex container possible values are stretch default flex start flex end center space between space around showdividerhorizontal one or more of none beginning middle end dividerdrawablehorizontal reference to a drawable puts horizontal dividers between flex lines or flex items when flexdirection is set to column or column rebase showdividervertical one or more of none beginning middle end dividerdrawablevertical reference to a drawable puts vertical dividers between flex items or flex lines when flexdirection is set to column or column rebase showdivider one or more of none beginning middle end dividerdrawable reference to a drawable shorthand for setting both horizontal and vertical dividers note that if used with other attributes such as justifycontent space around or aligncontent space between etc for putting spaces between flex lines or flex items you may see unexpected spaces please avoid using these at the same time example of putting both vertical and horizontal dividers res drawable divider xml xml shape xmlns android http schemas android com apk res android size android width 8dp android height 12dp solid android color 44a444 shape res layout content main xml xml textview style style flexitem android layout width 220dp android layout height 80dp android text 1 textview style style flexitem android layout width 120dp android layout height 80dp android text 2 textview style style flexitem android layout width 160dp

android layout height 80dp android text 5 attributes for the children of a flexboxlayout layout order integer this attribute can change how the ordering of the children views are laid out by default children are displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the layout xml if not specified 1 is set as a default value layout flexgrow float this attribute determines how much this child will grow if positive free space is distributed relative to the rest of other flex items included in the same flex line if a flex item has a positive layout flexgrow value the item will take up the remaining space in the flex line if multiple flex items in the same flex line have positive layout flexgrow values the remaining free space is distributed depending on the proportion of their declared layout flexgrow value similar to the layout weight attribute in the linearlayout if not specified 0 is set as a default value layout flexshrink float this attribute determines how much this child will shrink if negative free space is distributed relative to the rest of other flex items included in the same flex line if not specified 1 is set as a default value layout alignself this attribute determines the alignment along the cross axis perpendicular to the main axis the alignment in the same direction can be determined by the alignitems in the parent but if this is set to other than auto the cross axis alignment is overridden for this child possible values are auto default flex start flex end center baseline stretch layout flexbasispercent fraction the initial flex item length in a fraction format relative to its parent the initial main size of this child view is trying to be expanded as the specified fraction against the parent main size if this value is set the length specified from layout width or layout height is overridden by the calculated value from this attribute this attribute is only effective when the parents length is definite measurespec mode is measurespec exactly the default value is 1 which means not set layout minwidth layout minheight dimension these attributes impose minimum size constraints for the children of flexboxlayout a child view wont shrink less than the value of these attributes varies based on the flexdirection attribute as to which attribute imposes the size constraint along the main axis regardless of the layout flexshrink attribute layout maxwidth layout maxheight dimension these attributes impose maximum size constraints for the children of flexboxlayout a child view wont be expanded more than the value of these attributes varies based on the flexdirection attribute as to which attribute imposes the size constraint along the main axis regardless of the layout flexgrow attribute layout wrapbefore boolean this attribute forces a flex line wrapping the default value is false i e if this is set to true for a flex item the item will become the first item of a flex line a wrapping happens regardless of the flex items being processed in the previous flex line this attribute is ignored if the flex wrap attribute is set to nowrap the equivalent attribute isnt defined in the original css flexible box module specification but having this attribute is useful for android developers for example to flatten the layouts when building a grid like layout or for a situation where developers want to put a new flex line to make a semantic difference from the previous one etc others known differences from the original css specification this library tries to achieve the same capabilities of the original flexible box specification as much as possible but due to some reasons such as the way specifying attributes cant be the same between css and android xml there are some known differences from the original specification 1 there is no flex flow equivalent attribute because flex flow is a shorthand for setting the flex direction and flex wrap properties specifying two attributes from a single attribute is not practical in android 2 there is no flex equivalent attribute likewise flex is a shorthand for setting the flex grow flex shrink and flex basis specifying those attributes from a single attribute is not practical 3 layout flexbasispercent is introduced instead of flexbasis both layout flexbasispercent in this library and flex basis property in the css are used to determine the initial length of an individual flex item the flex basis property accepts width values such as 1em 10px and content as strings as well as percentage values such as 10 and 30 layout flexbasispercent only accepts percentage values however specifying initial fixed width values can be done by specifying width or height values in layout width or layout height varies depending on the flexdirection also the same effect can be done by specifying wrap content in layout width or layout height if developers want to achieve the same effect as content thus layout flexbasispercent only accepts percentage values which cant be done through layout width or layout height for simplicity 4 layout wrapbefore is introduced the equivalent attribute doesnt exist in the css flexible box module specification but as explained above android developers will benefit by having this attribute for having more control over when a wrapping happens xamarin binding xamarin binding is now available on nuget thanks to btripp demo apps flexbox playground demo app the demo playground module works as a playground demo app for trying various values for the supported attributes you can install it by gradlew demo playground installdebug cat gallery demo app the demo cat gallery module showcases the usage of the flexboxlayoutmanager inside the recyclerview that handles various sizes of views aligned nicely regardless of the device width like the google photo app without loading all the images on the memory thus compared to using the link flexboxlayout its much less likely to abuse the memory which sometimes leads to
