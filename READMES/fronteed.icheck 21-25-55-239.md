and others lightweight size — 1 kb gzipped 32 options to customize checkboxes and radio buttons 11 callbacks to handle changes 9 methods to make changes programmatically saves changes to original inputs works carefully with any selectors how it works icheck works with checkboxes and radio buttons like a constructor it wraps each input with a div which may be customized by you or using one of the available skins you may also place inside that div some html code or text using insert option for this html html foo bar bar with default options youll get nearly this html foo bar bar by default icheck doesnt provide any css styles for wrapper divs if you dont use skins options these options are default js checkbox or radio to style only checkboxes or radio buttons both by default handle base class added to customized checkboxes checkboxclass icheckbox base class added to customized radio buttons radioclass iradio class added on checked state input checked true checkedclass checked if not

labelhoverclass to label on input hover labelhover true class added to label if labelhover set to true labelhoverclass hover increase clickable area by given negative number to decrease increasearea true to set pointer css cursor over enabled inputs and default over disabled cursor false set true to inherit original inputs class name inheritclass false if set to true inputs id is prefixed with icheck and attached inheritid false set true to activate aria support aria false add html code or text inside customized input insert theres no need to copy and paste all of them you can just mention the ones you need js input icheck labelhover false cursor true you can choose any class names and style them as you want initialize just include icheck js after jquery v1 7 or zepto polyfill event data icheck supports any selectors but handles only checkboxes and radio buttons js customize all inputs will search for checkboxes and radio buttons input icheck handle inputs only inside block block input icheck handle only checkboxes inside test test input icheck handle checkbox handle vote class elements will search inside the element if its not an input vote icheck you can also change options after inputs are customized input some icheck different options indeterminate html5 allows specifying indeterminate partially checked state for checkboxes icheck supports this for both checkboxes and radio buttons you can make an input indeterminate through html using additional attributes supported by icheck both do the same job but indeterminate true may not work in some browsers like ie7 html indeterminate true determinate false indeterminate and determinate methods can be used to toggle indeterminate state callbacks icheck provides plenty callbacks which may be used to handle changes callback name when used ifclicked user clicked on a customized input or an assigned label ifchanged inputs checked disabled or indeterminate state is changed ifchecked inputs state is changed to checked ifunchecked checked state is removed iftoggled inputs checked state is changed ifdisabled inputs state is changed to disabled ifenabled disabled state is removed ifindeterminate inputs state is changed to indeterminate ifdeterminate indeterminate state is removed ifcreated input is just customized ifdestroyed customization is just removed use on method to bind them to inputs js input on ifchecked function event alert event type callback ifcreated callback should be binded before plugin init methods these methods can be used to make changes programmatically any selectors can be used js change inputs state to checked input icheck check remove checked state input icheck uncheck toggle checked state input icheck toggle change inputs state to disabled input icheck disable remove disabled state input icheck enable change inputs state to indeterminate input icheck indeterminate remove indeterminate state input icheck determinate apply input changes which were done outside the plugin input icheck update remove all traces of icheck input icheck destroy you may also specify some function that will be executed on each method call js input icheck check function alert well done sir feel free to fork and submit pull request or submit an issue if you find something not working comparison icheck is created to avoid routine of reinventing the wheel when working with checkboxes and radio buttons it provides an expected identical result for the huge number of browsers devices and their versions callbacks and methods can be used to easily handle and make changes at customized inputs there are some css3 ways available to style checkboxes and radio buttons like this one you have to know about some of the disadvantages of similar methods inputs are keyboard inaccessible since display none or visibility hidden used to hide them poor browser support multiple bugs on mobile devices tricky harder to maintain css code javascript is still needed to fix specific issues while css3 method is quite limited solution icheck is made to be an everyday replacement covering most of the tasks browser support icheck is verified to work in internet explorer 6 firefox 2 opera 9 google chrome and safari browsers should also work in many others mobile browsers like opera mini chrome mobile safari mobile android browser silk and others are also supported tested on ios ipad iphone ipod android blackberry and windows phone devices changelog march 03 2014 better hidpi screens support ddctd143 january 23 2014 v2 0 release candidate three ways to set an options global object window icheck data attributes input data checkedclass checked and direct javascript object input icheck options huge performance boost takes less than 1s to customize 1000 inputs minimized number of function calls some slow jquery functions are replaced with a faster vanilla alternatives without using any dependencies amd module definition support both for jquery and zepto unblocked native events icheck 2 x doesnt stop your newly or past binded events from being processed pointer events support full support for phones and tablets that use windows os such as lumia hp tablets desktops with a touch screen etc webos and firefox os support new methods input icheck data to get all the options were used for customization also stores a current states values checked disabled and indeterminate input icheck styler to get a wrapper div thats used for customization better handling of the indeterminate state ability to set callbacks in three ways global object direct javascript object or using bind method input on callback ability to switch off some of the callbacks when you dont need them global or per input inline styles dropped icheck wont add any inline styles to the elements until its highly needed cursor or area option fast click support removes a 300ms click delay on mobile devices without any dependencies icheck compatible with the fastclick plugin see the tap option ability to ignore customization for the selected inputs using init option if set to false optimized event bindings icheck binds only a few global events for the all inputs doesnt increase on elements addition instead of a couple for the each customized element doesnt store tons of arbitrary data event in jquery or zepto cache defines customized elements by specific classnames extra ins tag is dropped less dom modifications icheck wraps each input with a single div and doesnt use any extra markup for the any option optimized reflows and repaints on init and state changes better options handling icheck will never run a single line of js to process an options that are off or empty ability to auto customize the ajax loaded inputs without using any extra code autoajax option on by default auto inits on domready using the specified selector autoinit option searches for icheck by default classnames can be changed using the window classes object memory usage optimization uses only a few amount of memory works well on low memory devices betters callbacks architecture these are fired only after changes are applied to the input ability to set a mirror classes between the inputs and assigned labels using the hoverlabelclass focuslabelclass activelabelclass checkedlabelclass disabledlabelclass and indeterminatelabelclass options mirror option should be set to true to make this happen fixes some issues of the mobile devices fixes the issues of the wrapper labels that loose a click ability in some browsers if no for attribute is set some other options and improvements various bug fixes note extended docs and usage examples will be available later december 19 2013 added bower support added to jquery plugin registry december 18 2013 added aria attributes support for voiceover and others myfreeweb added amazon kindle support skinofstars fixed clickable links inside labels legas fixed lines separation between labels and inputs merged two versions of the plugin jquery and zepto into one fixed demo links fixed callbacks pepijnsenders license icheck plugin is released under the mit license feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects
