building prerequisites openrct2 requires original files of rollercoaster tycoon 2 to play it can be bought at either steam or gog com windows 7 8 10 visual studio 2017 update 7 enterprise professional community free desktop development with c windows 10 sdk 10 0 14393 0 7 zip for deployment only nsis for deployment only macos xcode 8 the program can also be built as a command line program using cmake this type of build requires xcode command line tools homebrew cmake available through homebrew linux sdl2 only for ui client freetype can be disabled fontconfig can be disabled libzip 1 0 libpng 1 2 speexdsp only for ui client curl only if building with http support jansson 2 5 openssl 1 0 only if building with multiplayer support icu 59 0 zlib gl commonly provided by mesa or gpu vendors only for ui client can be disabled cmake 3 2 compiling and running windows check out the repository this can be done using github desktop or other tools open a new developer command prompt for vs 2017 then navigate to the repository e g cd c \github\openrct2 run msbuild openrct2 proj t build p platform x64 run the game bin\openrct2 once you have ran msbuild once further development can be done within visual studio by opening openrct2 sln other examples set platform x64 msbuild openrct2 proj t clean msbuild openrct2 proj t rebuild p configuration release msbuild openrct2 proj t g2 msbuild openrct2 proj t publishportable macos xcode the recommended way of building openrct2 for macos is with xcode the xcode build will create a self contained application bundles which include all the necessary game files and dependencies open the project file openrct2 xcodeproj in xcode and build from there building this way will handle the dependencies for you automatically you can also invoke an xcode build from the command line using xcodebuild cmake a command line version of openrct2 can be built using cmake this type of build requires you to provide the dependencies yourself the supported method of doing this is with homebrew once you have homebrew installed you can download all the required libraries with this command brew install cmake openssl jansson libpng sdl2 speexdsp libzip freetype pkg config once you have the dependencies installed you can build the project using cmake using the following commands mkdir build cd build cmake make ln s data data then you can run the game by running openrct2 linux the standard cmake build procedure is to install the required libraries then mkdir build cd build cmake make detailed instructions can be found on our wiki 4 contributing
