themes switch color scheme custom accents configuration development contribution known issues authors icon reference color palette supported ides thanks to the awesome guys at jetbrains the plugin is now supported on pretty much all ide however there might be some issues on rider since its a different sdk android studio is partly supported ides versions 2016 x and lower up until version 0 2 3 ides versions 2017 1 2 up until version 0 10 6 ides versions 2017 3 up until version 1 6 0 4 ides versions 2018 1 version 2 4 0 2018 1 and above ides versions 2018 2 version 2 4 0 2018 2 and above android studio 2 2 3 up until version 0 2 3 android studio 3 0 0 all versions installation open the settings preferences dialog osx unix ⌘ windows ctrl alt s in the left hand pane select plugins click browse repositories and search for material theme ui click install plugin and confirm your intention to download and install the plugin click ok in the settings dialog and restart for the changes to take effect note this is not installing a new look and feel instead it is overwriting the darcula theme therefore when you switch to another laf and select back darcula you will revert to the original darcula laf you will probably need to restart the ide to retrieve the material laf switching the ide theme there are many ways to change the material theme look and feel of the ide from the ide menu tools material theme from the main toolbar there is an icon like a blue dot from the search everything look for material from the quick switch panel ctrl windows ctrl from the material theme settings directly there are currently 4 bundled material themes oceanic theme a nice oceanic blue like theme darker theme a more classic dark theme lighter theme a light variation of the theme palenight theme a more purplish theme and 5 other bundled themes monokai pro theme arc dark theme atom one dark theme solarized dark solarized light besides the plugin offers an endpoint allowing plugin developers to develop their own themes just like color schemes you can look for example for the dracula theme a port of the dracula color scheme and you can also disable the theming and revert to the original darcula while still keeping material theme additions such as the icons and ui components custom themes with the ability to set up custom themes we can even start to host a gallery of custom themes i will add some that are the most popular or even give the ability to import them set color scheme code this plugin will not set the new color scheme for you as that would cause a couple problems you need to set the new color scheme manually open the settings preferences dialog again in the left hand pane select editor colors fonts in the scheme dropdown youll find 9 new schemes material oceanic material darker material palenight material lighter material monokai pro material one dark atom one dark solarized dark and solarized light choose the scheme you like and hit apply and ok shortcut ctrl windows ctrl then hit 1 color scheme and select your desired color scheme important this plugin is coming with these bundled color schemes the same way that intellij comes with predefined color schemes such as darcula solarized monokai and such therefore whenever you change one of their values to suit your needs the ide will be creating a copy of the bundled scheme and it will appear blued in the select box that also means that subsequent updates of the plugins color schemes will not be reflected to your copies in order to receive them you will need to reset your changes go to colors and fonts at the right of your selected color scheme there is a gear icon click on the gear and choose restore defaults of course you will lose all your changes so if you need to reflect them back after resetting create a copy first and go change by change note sometimes resetting the defaults will not work in this case you will have to manually delete your copy https intellij support jetbrains

possible to customize the material themes theme colors to your own desires you can find the options under appearance material custom theme there you can find the different colors used and customize them to whatever suits your needs let your creative desires bloom in order to select your custom theme you will need to select the theme inside the material theme chooser called custom theme a light variant is also available external themes since version 2 0 an option for external plugins to import their own themes to the material theme plugin has been added but is still in beta testing an example of this is the dracula theme based on the popular dracula color scheme be creative and develop your own themes material status file colors since the latest releases jetbrains removed the file status colors from the color schemes and set it inside version control file status colors however doing so removed the customability of the file status colors from the custom color schemes this feature brings it back you can find the settings to set the file colors under colors and fonts material file colors of course this is per color scheme not per theme so please take this into consideration note this feature conflicts with the file status colors ide feature therefore it is highly preferrable to use the material file colors for all file colors based customizations if you prefer to use ides settings instead be aware that bugs could occur that i didnt take into consideration note 2 this feature is modifying the ide meaning that removing disabling the feature will keep these colors in place even after restarting the ide for a complete cleanup you will need to delete the user darcula icls file from inside the colors settings directory https intellij support jetbrains com hc en us articles 206544519 directories used by the ide to store settings caches plugins and logs then delete the user darcula icls files custom accents from version 0 7 0 the plugin can now have different accent colors to change the accent color just press on the accents action button on the toolbar quick switch tools then select the desired accent color the accent color is changing active tab highlight color unless the custom tab highlight color is checked open folder icon tool window icons hover color modified file color sliders branches in vcs log progress bar active input selected checkbox selected radio button edited and pinned file indicators fold unfold icons documentation links and bold texts pressed action button toggle state autocomplete quick info caret color scrollbars when the accent scrollbars is checked modified settings indicator switches in search everything navigation bar selected items project view decorators another feature taken from the sublime plugin is the ability to differentiate opened directories from closed ones opened directories actually mean directories from the project view whose one of their children is opened in the editor the plugin is decorating these directories by setting an outlined directory icon tinted with the selected accent color you can disable this behavior through the settings or the action buttons in the toolbar decorated folders another yet cool feature depending on the project view decorators is the ability to set specific icons to commonly used directories such as src test log config and so on just like the file icons feature this allows to increase the visual grepping by quickly diffentiating between directories this is available from 2 1 5 configuration you can customize some plugin features in a settings panel under settings appearance material theme more info at http www material theme com docs configuration settings development requirements jdk 1 8 intellij idea with gradle developing using intellij gradle you can simplify development process thanks to intellijs gradle plugin install the plugin restart the ide and you will be prompted with a window asking if you want to import the project as a gradle project after that intellij will download the gradle wrapper and the tasks will appear in the gradle tool panel on the right import the project from the build gradle file and develop as normal make sure you select jdk 8 in the import wizard the other defaults are fine you can run the above mentioned cli gradle tasks directly in the gradle tool window which expands from the right side of the screen to debug find runide in the list right click it and choose run debug contribution pull requests are appreciated i can use some help on bugs and features listed in https github com chrisrm material theme jetbrains issues or you can send me some new ideas however please note that this is a plugin dedicated to replicate the sublime plugin so it should coincide with its features and not deviate too much known issues color schemes copy as stated in the color schemes section whenever you change an attribute of the default color schemes a copy will be created and from then on you wont be able to receive updates to the color schemes however in some occasions especially when using third party plugins the color schemes will be altered without your input resulting in the aforementioned effect for instance the markdown navigator plugin creates a lot of properties when selecting a scheme and even selecting restore defaults will still result to creating a copy dark title bar on windows the dark title bar option is actually modifying the title bar color in the whole operating system in windows since there is currently no way to do it per application this setting will modify the os itself if you checked it and saved and want to change the color back follow the instructions at https www howtogeek com 225893 how to personalize windows 10s appearance file colors stuck after uninstallation the file status colors feature is also a feature that sticks outside of the realm of the plugin as it modifies the ide itself therefore when uninstalling disabling the plugin the colors will stuck if you want to reset to the default colors open the settings at version control file status colors in 2017 3 in previous versions you will need to go to the config directory and delete the user darcula icls color scheme manually authors twitter crmag chrisrm mallowigi mallowigi thanks to equinusocio for the inspiration other portings the material theme has been
