linux openpose represents the first real time multi person system to jointly detect human body hand and facial keypoints in total 135 keypoints on single images features functionality 2d real time multi person keypoint detection 15 or 18 or 25 keypoint body foot keypoint estimation running time invariant to number of detected people 2x21 keypoint hand keypoint estimation currently running time depends on number of detected people 70 keypoint face keypoint estimation currently running time depends on number of detected people 3d real time single person keypoint detection 3 d triangulation from multiple single views synchronization of flir cameras handled compatible with flir point grey cameras but provided c demos to add your custom input calibration toolbox easy estimation of

version from the releases section otherwise check doc installation md for instructions on how to build openpose from source quick start most users do not need the openpose c api but they can simply use the basic demo and or openpose wrapper demo to easily process images video webcam and display save the results see doc demo overview md e g run openpose in a video with ubuntu build examples

any other stereo vision task see doc modules calibration module md openpose wrapper if you want to read a specific input and or add your custom post processing function and or implement your own display saving check the wrapper tutorial on examples tutorial wrapper you can create your custom code on examples user code and quickly compile it with cmake when compiling the whole openpose project quickly add your custom code see examples user code readme md for further details openpose c api see doc library introduction md adding an extra module check doc library add new module md standalone face or hand detector face keypoint detection without body keypoint detection if you want to speed it up but also reduce amount of detected faces check the opencv face detector approach in doc standalone face or hand keypoint detector md use your own face hand detector you can use the hand and or face keypoint detectors with your own face or hand detectors rather than using the body detector e g useful for camera views at which the hands are visible but not the body openpose detector would fail see doc standalone face or hand keypoint detector md library dependencies openpose uses default caffe and opencv as well as any caffe dependency the demos additionally use gflags it could easily be ported to other deep learning frameworks tensorflow torch feel free to make a pull request if you implement any of those output output format keypoint index ordering etc in doc output md speeding up openpose and benchmark check the openpose benchmark as well as some hints to speed up and or reduce the memory requirements for openpose on doc faq md speed up memory reduction and benchmark send us failure cases and feedback our library is open source for research purposes and we want to continuously improve it so please let us know if you find videos or images where openpose does not seems to work well feel free to send them to openposecmu gmail com email only for failure cases we will use them to improve the quality of the algorithm you find any bug in functionality or speed you added some functionality to some class or some new worker subclass which we might potentially incorporate you know how to speed up or improve any part of the library you have a request about possible functionality etc just comment on github or make a pull request and we will answer as soon as possible send us an email if you use the library to make a cool demo or youtube video authors and contributors openpose is authored by gines hidalgo zhe cao tomas simon shih en wei hanbyul joo and yaser sheikh currently it is being maintained by gines hidalgo and yaadhav raaj the original cvpr 2017 repo includes matlab and python versions as well as the training code the body pose estimation work is based on the original eccv 2016 demo in addition openpose would not be possible without the cmu panoptic studio dataset we would also like to thank all the people who helped openpose in any way the main contributors are listed in doc contributors md citation please cite these papers in your publications if it helps your research the face keypoint detector was trained
