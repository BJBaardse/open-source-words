welcome to itsy bitsy data structures in here are super simplified examples of many of the common data structures written in easy to read javascript reading through the guided code will help you learn about what data structures are what their uses are and how to discuss them want to jump into the code click here also be sure to check out my other code walkthrough the super tiny compiler why should i care data structures might not be the juiciest topic in the world but they are hugely important to growing as an engineer knowing data structures dont just make your programs faster and more efficient but they help you organize your code and your thoughts so that you can build more complicated programs without a ton of mental overhead but data structures are scary yeah lots of computer science topics are intimidating and thats largely a fault of how they are taught in this were going to do a high level pass over a lot of the key things you need to know in order to dive into them deeper its more about introducing you to the shared language of data structures okay so where do i begin awesome head on over to the itsy bitsy data structures js file im back that didnt make sense ouch im really sorry im planning on doing a lot more work on this to add inline annotations if you want to come back when thats done you can either watch star this repo or follow me on twitter for updates
