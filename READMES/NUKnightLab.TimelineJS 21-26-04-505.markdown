this version of timeline is no longer under development knight lab has created a new version at https github com nuknightlab timelinejs3 the new library should work with existing google spreadsheets but not existing timelinejs json files knight lab will continue to serve this version of timeline from https cdn knightlab com libs timeline latest js timeline min js https cdn knightlab com libs

web but they are almost all either hard on the eyes or hard to use create timelines that are at the same time beautiful and intuitive for users timelinejs is great for pulling in media from different sources just throw in a link from twitter youtube flickr vimeo google maps or soundcloud and timelinejs will format it to fit perfectly more media types will be supported in the future creating one is as easy as filling in a google spreadsheet or as detailed as json add it to your site using inline easiest place the embed code where you want the timeline to show in the body of your site see config

timelinejs head body div id my timeline div body loading the files if you like you may load timelinejs from the knightlabs cdn the examples above demonstrate how to do this using story embed js which is the simplest way to set up a timeline of your own if for some reason you need more fine grained control over your timeline load the javascript and css files separately we recommend that you load them from our cdn html always load the css link rel stylesheet type text css href https cdn knightlab com libs timeline latest css timeline css and then one of either script type text javascript src https cdn knightlab com libs timeline latest js timeline js script or script type text javascript src https cdn knightlab com libs timeline latest js timeline min js script but no need for both if you need to serve copies of the files from your own server use the entire contents of the build directory of our github repository if you use a local copy of story embed js it should automatically load the other timeline resources from your server config options here are some of the options you can set in the config source source should be either the path to the json resource to load or a javascript object corresponding to the timeline model here is an example using a data object javascript var dataobject timeline headline headline type createstoryjs type timeline width 800 height 600 source dataobject embed id my timeline if source is a string we will try to automatically recognize resources that are twitter searches google spreadsheets or storify stories failing that we assume the source is either json or jsonp if string matches on jsonp we will treat it as jsonp otherwise we will append callback onjsonp data see more details below language lang localization default is en

your timeline in a spreadsheet its as simple as dropping a date text and links into the appropriate columns in timelinejss template you can find the template here timelinejs google spreadsheet template there are only a couple things you need to know in order to create a timeline using google docs make the spreadsheet public google docs are automatically set to private but the spreadsheet must be public click the blue “share” button on the top right hand corner in the “share settings” window youll see the private setting of the spreadsheet click “change ” in the visibility options window choose “public on the web” and save publish to the web under the file menu select “publish to the web ” in the next window check the box next to “automatically republish when changes are made ” uncheck all other boxes click “start publishing ” this will give you the url to embed in your html file copy paste the web url into your timelinejs html file after you publish the spreadsheet google docs will generate a link to the file copy the link for the web page option as opposed to pdf html xls etc then paste it into the timelines html file see add it to your site storify support for storify is still in its early stages it works though just paste a link to the storify story as the source media included in the zip file is a kitchen sink example this timeline shows how to incorporate the different media types from different services like twitter youtube flickr instagram twitpic wikipedia dailymotion soundcloud and vimeo just copy and paste the address of the media from the browser bar into the media parameter timelinejs will auto magically pull in the media via their api and format it best practices tips and tricks to best utilize timelinejs keep it light dont get bogged down by text or other elements pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative it does not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline include events that build up to major occurrences not just the major events dont overwhelm the user a timeline with hundreds of events is probably not the best use of the format license this source code form is subject to the terms
