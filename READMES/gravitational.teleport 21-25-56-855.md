gravitational teleport gravitational teleport is a modern ssh server for remotely accessing clusters of linux servers via ssh or https it is intended to be used instead of sshd for organizations who need ssh audit with session recording replay easily manage ssh trust between teams organizations and data centers ssh into behind firewall clusters without any open ports role based access control rbac for ssh protocol in addition to its hallmark features teleport is interesting for smaller teams because it facilitates easy adoption of the best ssh practices like no need to distribute keys teleport uses certificate based access with automatic certificate expiration time 2nd factor authentication 2fa for ssh collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing single sign on sso for ssh and your organization identities via openid connect or saml with endpoints like okta or active directory cluster introspection every ssh node and its status can be queried via cli and web ui teleport is built on top of the high quality golang ssh implementation and it is fully compatible with openssh and can be used with sshd servers and ssh clients project links description teleport website the official website of the project documentation admin guide user manual and more demo video 3 minute video overview of the ui teleconsole the free service to invite ssh clients behind nat built on top of teleport blog our blog where we publish teleport news installing and running download the latest binary release unpack the tar gz and run sudo install this will copy teleport binaries into usr local bin then you can run teleport as a single node cluster bash sudo teleport start in a production environment teleport must run as root but to play just do chown user var lib teleport and run it under user in this case you will not be able to login as someone else though building teleport teleport source code consists of the actual teleport daemon binary written in golang and also it has a web ui located in web directory written in javascript the webui is not changed often and we keep it checked into git under dist so you only need to build golang make sure you have golang v1 8 3 or newer then run bash get the source build mkdir p gopath src github com gravitational cd gopath src github com gravitational git clone https github com gravitational teleport git cd teleport make full create the default data directory before starting sudo mkdir p var lib teleport sudo chown user var lib teleport if the build succeds the binaries will be placed in gopath src github com gravitational teleport build note the go compiler is somewhat sensitive to amount of memory you will need at least 1gb of virtual memory to compile teleport 512mb instance without swap will not work rebuilding web ui to enable speedy iterations on the web ui teleport can load the web ui assets from the source directory to enable this behavior set the environment variable debug 1 and rebuild with the default target bash make run teleport as a single node cluster in development mode debug 1 build teleport start d keep the server running in this mode and make your ui changes in dist directory refer to web readme md for instructions on how to update the web ui why did we build teleport mature tech companies with significant infrastructure footprints tend to implement most of these patterns internally teleport allows smaller companies without significant in house ssh expertise to easily adopt them as well teleport comes with an accessible web ui and a very permissive apache 2 0 license to facilitate adoption and use being a complete standalone tool teleport can be used as a software library enabling trust management in complex multi cluster multi region scenarios across many teams within multiple organizations more information quick start guide teleport architecture admin manual user manual faq contributing the best way to contribute is to create issues or pull requests right here on github you can also reach the gravitational team through their website is teleport secure and production ready teleport has completed several security audits from the nationally recognized technology security companies some of them have been made public we are comfortable with the use of teleport from a security perspective however teleport is still a relatively young product so you may experience usability issues we are actively supporting teleport and addressing any issues that are submitted to this repo ask questions send pull requests report issues and dont be shy the latest stable teleport build can be found in releases known issues teleport does not officially support ipv6 yet who built teleport teleport was created by gravitational inc we have built teleport by borrowing from our previous experiences at rackspace it has been extracted from telekube our kubernetes distribution optimized for deploying and remotely controlling complex applications into multiple environments at the same time multiple cloud regions colocation private enterprise clouds located behind firewalls
