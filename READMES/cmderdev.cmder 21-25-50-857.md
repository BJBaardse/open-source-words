cmder cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on windows it is based on conemu with major config overhaul comes with a monokai color scheme amazing clink further enhanced by clink completions and a custom prompt layout why use it the main advantage of cmder is portability it is designed to be totally self contained with no external dependencies which makes it great for usb sticks or cloud storage so you can carry your console aliases and binaries like wget curl and git with you anywhere the cmders user interface is also designed to be more eye pleasing and you can compare the main differences between cmder and conemu here installation single user portable config download the latest release extract the archive note this path should not be c \program files or anywhere else that would require administrator access for modifying configuration files optional place your own executable files into the cmder root \bin folder to be injected into your path run cmder exe shared cmder install with non portable individual user config download the latest release extract the archive to a shared location optional place your own executable files into the cmder root \bin folder to be injected into your path optional create userprofile \cmder config\bin folder to be injected into individual users path default is to auto create this on first run optional place your own executable files into the userprofile \cmder config\bin folder to be injected into your path run cmder exe with c command line argument example cmder exe c userprofile \cmder config this will create the following directory structure if it is missing c \users\ username \cmder config ├───bin └───config └───profile d both the shared install and the individual user config locations can contain a full set of init and profile d scripts enabling shared config with user overrides see below cmder exe command line arguments argument description c user

context menu integration so youve experimented with cmder a little and want to give it a shot in a more permanent home shortcut to open cmder in a chosen folder open a terminal as an administrator navigate to the directory you have placed cmder execute \cmder exe register all if you get a message access denied ensure you are executing the command in an administrator prompt in a file explorer window right click in or on a directory to see cmder here in the context menu keyboard shortcuts tab manipulation ctrl t new tab dialog maybe you want to open cmd as admin ctrl w close tab ctrl d

some shortcuts are not yet documented though they exist please document them here features access to multiple shells in one window using tabs you can open multiple tabs each containing one of the following shells task shell description cmder cmd exe windows cmd exe shell enhanced with git git aware prompt clink gnu readline and aliases cmder as admin cmd exe administrative windows cmd exe

linux like bash shell running on windows bash as admin bash exe administrative unix linux like bash shell running on windows mintty bash exe unix linux like bash shell running on windows see below for mintty configuration differences mintty as admin bash exe administrative unix linux like bash shell running on windows see below for mintty configuration differences cmder powershell and bash tabs all run on top of the windows console api and work as you might expect in cmder with access to use conemus color schemes key bindings and other settings defined in the conemu settings dialog ⚠ note only the full edition of cmder comes with a pre installed bash using a vendored git for windows installation the pre configured bash tabs may not work on cmder mini eidition without additional configuration you may however choose to use an external installation of bash such as microsofts subsystem for linux called wsl or the cygwin project which provides posix support on windows ⚠ note mintty tabs use a program called mintty as the terminal emulator that is not based on the windows console api rather its rendered graphically by conemu mintty differs from the other tabs in that it supports xterm xterm 256color term types and does not work with conemu settings like color schemes and key bindings as such some differences in functionality are to be expected such as cmder not being able to apply a system wide configuration to it as a result mintty specific config is done via the userprofile home minttyrc file you may read more about mintty and its config file here an example of setting cmder portable terminal colors for mintty from a bash mintty shell cd cmder root vendor git clone https github com karlin mintty colors solarized git cd mintty colors solarized echo source \

ssh agent which is in the vendor git for windows cmd folder if you want to run ssh agent on startup include the line call git install root cmd start ssh agent cmd in cmder root config user profile cmd usually just uncomment it vendored git cmder is by default shipped with a vendored git installation on each instance of launching cmder an attempt is made to locate any other user provided git binaries upon finding a git exe binary cmder further compares its version against the vendored one by executing it the vendored git exe binary is only used when it is more recent than the user installed one you may use your favorite version of git by including its path in the path enviroment variable moreover the mini edition of cmder found on the downloads page excludes any vendored git binaries using external cygwin babun msys2 wsl or git for windows sdk with cmder you may run bash the default shell used on linux macos and gnu hurd externally on cmder using the following instructions setup a new task by pressing win alt t click the button to add a task name the new task in the top text box provide task parameters this is optional add cmd c path to external env \bin\bash login i new console to the commands text box recommended optional steps copy the vendor cmder exinit file to the cygwin babun msys2 or git for windows sdk environments etc profile d folder to use portable settings in the cmder root config folder note mingw could work if the init scripts include profile d but this has not been tested the destination file extension depends on the shell you use in that environment for example bash copy to etc profile d cmder exinit sh zsh copy to etc profile d cmder exinit zsh uncomment and edit the below line in the script to use cmder config even when launched from outside cmder cmder root userprofile cmder this is not required if launched from cmder integrating cmder with hyper microsoft vs code and your favorite ides cmder by default comes with a vendored conemu installation as the underlying terminal emulator as stated here however cmder can in fact run in a variety of other terminal emulators and even integrated ides assuming you have the latest version of cmder follow the following instructions to get cmder working with your own terminal emulator for instructions on how to integrate cmder with your ide please read our wiki section upgrading the process of upgrading cmder depends on the version build you are currently running if you have a cmder root config user conemu xml you are running a newer version of cmder follow the below process exit all cmder sessions and relaunch cmder root cmder exe this backs up your existing cmder root vendor conemu maximus5 conemu xml to cmder root config user conemu xml the cmder root config user conemu xml contains any custom settings you have made using the setup tasks settings dialog exit all cmder sessions and backup any files you have manually edited under cmder root vendor editing files under cmder root vendor is not recommended since you will need to re apply these changes after any upgrade all user customizations should go in cmder root config folder delete the cmder root vendor folder extract the new cmder zip or cmder mini zip into cmder root overwriting all files when prompted if you do not have a cmder root config user conemu xml you are running an older version of cmder follow the below process exit all cmder sessions and backup cmder root vendor conemu maximus5 conemu xml to cmder root config user conemu xml backup any files you have manually edited under cmder root vendor editing files under cmder root vendor is not recommended since you will need to re apply these changes after any upgrade all user customizations should go in cmder root config folder delete the cmder root vendor folder extract the new cmder zip or cmder mini zip into cmder root overwriting all files when prompted current development builds you can download builds of the
