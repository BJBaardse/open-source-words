go ipfs ipfs implementation in go ipfs is a global versioned peer to peer filesystem it combines good ideas from git bittorrent kademlia sfs and the web it is like a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects ipfs provides an interface as simple as the http web but with permanence built in you can also mount the world at ipfs for more info see https github com ipfs ipfs please put all issues regarding ipfs design in the ipfs repo issues please put all issues regarding the go ipfs implementation in this repo table of contents security issues install system requirements install prebuilt packages from linux package managers build from source install go download and compile ipfs troubleshooting development dependencies updating usage getting started some things to try docker usage troubleshooting contributing want to hack on ipfs want to read our code license security issues the ipfs protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development this means that there may be problems in our protocols or there may be mistakes in our implementations and though ipfs is not production ready yet many people are already running nodes in their machines so we take security vulnerabilities very seriously if you discover a security issue please bring it to our attention right away if you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments for example by exposing a remote execution exploit please send your report privately to security ipfs io please do not file a public issue the gpg key for security ipfs io is 4b9665fb 92636d17 7c7a86d3 50aae8a9 59b13af3 if the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something not yet deployed just discuss it openly install the canonical download instructions for ipfs are over at http ipfs io docs install it is highly suggested you follow those instructions if you are not interested in working on ipfs development system requirements ipfs can run on most linux macos and windows systems we recommend running it on a machine with at least 2 gb of ram itll do fine with only one cpu core but it should run fine with as little as 1 gb of ram on systems with less memory it may not be completely stable install prebuilt packages we host prebuilt binaries over at our distributions page from there click the blue download go ipfs on the right side of the page open extract the archive move ipfs to your path install sh can do it for you from linux package managers arch linux nix snap arch linux in arch linux go ipfs is available as go ipfs package sudo pacman s go ipfs development version of go ipfs is also on aur under go ipfs git you can install it using your favourite aur helper or manually from aur nix for linux and macosx you can use the purely functional package manager nix nix env i ipfs you can also install the package by using its attribute name which is also ipfs snap with snap in any of the supported linux distributions sudo snap install ipfs build from source install go the build process for ipfs requires go 1 10 or higher if you dont have it download go 1 10 youll need to add gos bin directories to your path environment variable e g by adding these lines to your etc profile for a system wide installation or home profile export path path usr local go bin export path path gopath bin if you run into trouble see the go install instructions download and compile ipfs go get u d github com ipfs go ipfs cd gopath src github com ipfs go ipfs make install if you are building on freebsd instead of make install use gmake install building on less common systems if your operating system isnt officially supported but you still want to try building ipfs anyways it should work fine in most cases you can do the following instead of make install make install unsupported note this process may break if gx used for dependency management or any of its dependencies break as go get will always select the latest code for every dependency often resulting in mismatched apis troubleshooting separate instructions are available for building on windows also instructions for openbsd git is required in order for go get to fetch all dependencies package managers often contain out of date golang packages ensure that go version reports at least 1 10 see above for how to install go if you are interested in development please install the development dependencies as well warning older versions of osx fuse for mac os x can cause kernel panics when mounting we strongly recommend you use the latest version of osx fuse see https github com ipfs go ipfs issues 177 for more details on setting up fuse so that you can mount the filesystem see the docs folder shell command completion is available in misc completion ipfs completion bash read docs command completion md to learn how to install it see the init examples for how to connect ipfs to systemd or whatever init system your distro uses development dependencies if you make changes to the protocol buffers you will need to install the protoc compiler updating updating using ipfs update ipfs has an updating tool that can be accessed through ipfs update the tool is not installed alongside ipfs in order to keep that logic independent of the main codebase to install ipfs update download it here downloading ipfs builds using ipfs list the available versions of go ipfs ipfs cat ipns dist

ipfs uses a repository in the local file system by default the repo is located at ipfs to change the repo location set the ipfs path environment variable export ipfs path path to ipfsrepo getting started see also http ipfs io docs getting started to start using ipfs you must first initialize ipfss config files on your system this is done with ipfs init see ipfs init help for information on the optional arguments it takes after initialization is complete you can use ipfs mount ipfs add and any of the other commands to explore some things to try basic proof of ipfs working locally echo hello world hello ipfs add hello this should output a hash string that looks something like qmt78zsubmus4z925wzfrqq1qhaj56dqatfymuf7f8ff5o ipfs cat that hash docker usage an ipfs docker image is hosted at hub docker com r ipfs go ipfs to make files visible inside the container you need to mount a host directory with the v option to docker choose a directory that you want to use to import export files from ipfs you should also choose a directory to store ipfs files that will persist when you restart the container export ipfs staging absolute path to somewhere export ipfs data absolute path to somewhere else start a container running ipfs and expose ports 4001 5001 and 8080 docker run d name ipfs host v ipfs staging export v ipfs data data ipfs p 4001 4001 p 127 0 0 1 8080 8080 p 127 0 0 1 5001 5001 ipfs go ipfs latest watch the ipfs log docker logs f ipfs host wait for ipfs to start ipfs is running when you see gateway readonly server listening on ip4 0 0 0 0 tcp 8080 you can now stop watching the log run ipfs commands docker exec ipfs host ipfs args for example connect to peers docker exec ipfs host ipfs swarm peers add files cp r something ipfs staging docker exec ipfs host ipfs add r export something stop the running container docker stop ipfs host troubleshooting if you have previously installed ipfs before and you are running into problems getting a newer version to work try deleting or backing up somewhere else your ipfs config directory ipfs by default and rerunning ipfs init this will reinitialize the config file to its defaults and clear out the local datastore of any bad entries please direct general questions and help requests to our forum or our irc channel freenode ipfs if you believe youve found a bug check the issues list and if you dont see your problem there either come talk to us on irc freenode ipfs or file an issue of your own contributing we ❤️ all our contributors this project wouldnt be what it is without you if you want to help out please see
