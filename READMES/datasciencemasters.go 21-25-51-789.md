000 skilled data scientists and 1 5 million managers and analysts capable of reaping actionable insights from the big data deluge mckinsey report highlights the impending data scientist shortage 23 july 2013 there are little to no data scientists with 5 years experience because the job simply did not exist david hardtke how to hire a data scientist 13 nov 2012 an academic shortfall classic academic conduits arent providing data scientists this talent gap will be closed differently academic credentials are important but not necessary for high quality data science the core aptitudes – curiosity intellectual agility statistical fluency research stamina scientific rigor skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are widely distributed throughout the population were likely to see more uncredentialed inexperienced individuals try their hands at data science bootstrapping their skills on the open source ecosystem and using the diversity of modeling tools available just as data science platforms and tools are proliferating through the magic of open source big datas data scientist pool will as well and theres yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap the democratization of data science while i agree wholeheartedly with radens statement that “the crème de la crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia technology vendors wall street research and government ” i think hes understating the extent to which autodidacts – the self taught uncredentialed data passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations
