tensorflow js tensorflow js is an open source hardware accelerated javascript library for training and deploying machine learning models develop ml in the browser use flexible and intuitive apis to build models from scratch using the low level javascript linear algebra library or the high level layers api run existing models use tensorflow js model converters to run pre existing tensorflow models right in the browser retrain existing models retrain pre existing ml models using sensor data connected to the browser or other client side data about this repo this repository contains the logic and scripts that combine two packages tensorflow js core a flexible low level api formerly known as deeplearn js tensorflow js layers a high level api which implements functionality similar to keras if you care about bundle size you can import those packages individually examples check out our examples repository and our tutorials migrating from deeplearn js see these release notes for how to migrate from deeplearn js to tensorflow js getting started there are two main ways to get tensorflow js in your javascript project via script tags or by installing it from npm and using a build tool like parcel webpack or rollup via script tag add the following code to an html file html load tensorflow js place your code in the script tag below you can also use an external js file script notice there is no import statement tf is available on the index page because of the script tag above define a model for linear regression const model tf sequential model add tf layers dense units 1 inputshape 1 prepare the model for training specify the loss and the optimizer model compile loss meansquarederror optimizer sgd generate some synthetic data for training const xs tf tensor2d 1 2 3 4 4 1 const ys tf tensor2d 1 3 5 7 4 1 train the model using the data model fit xs ys then use the model to do inference on a data point the model hasnt seen before open the browser devtools to see the output model predict tf tensor2d 5 1 1 print script open up that html file in your browser and the code should run via npm add tensorflow js to your project using yarn or npm note because we use es2017 syntax such as import this workflow assumes you are using a modern browser or a bundler transpiler to convert your code to something older browsers understand see our examples to see how we use parcel to build our code however you are free to use any build tool that you prefer js import as tf from tensorflow tfjs define a model for linear regression const model tf sequential model add tf layers dense units 1 inputshape 1 prepare the model for training specify the loss and the optimizer model compile loss meansquarederror optimizer sgd generate some synthetic data for training const xs tf tensor2d 1 2 3 4 4 1 const ys tf tensor2d 1 3 5 7 4 1 train the model using the data model fit xs ys then use the model to do inference on a data point the model hasnt seen before model predict tf tensor2d 5 1 1 print see our tutorials examples and documentation for more details importing pre trained models we support porting pre trained models from tensorflow savedmodel keras find out more tensorflow js is a part of the tensorflow ecosystem for more info js tensorflow org tutorials api reference help mailing list
