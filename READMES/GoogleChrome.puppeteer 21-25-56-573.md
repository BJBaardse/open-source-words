puppeteer start badges end badges gen last released api api gen stop faq contributing puppeteer is a node library which provides a high level api to control chrome or chromium over the devtools protocol puppeteer runs headless by default but can be configured to run full non headless chrome or chromium start usecases what can i do most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using puppeteer here are a few examples to get you started generate screenshots and pdfs of pages crawl a spa and generate pre rendered content i e ssr automate form submission ui testing keyboard input etc create an up to date automated testing environment run your tests directly in the latest version of chrome using the latest javascript and browser features capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues end usecases give it a spin https try puppeteer appspot com start getstarted getting started installation to use puppeteer in your project run bash npm i puppeteer or yarn add puppeteer note when you install puppeteer it downloads a recent version of chromium 170mb mac 282mb linux 280mb win that is guaranteed to work with the api to skip the download see environment variables usage caution puppeteer requires at least node v6 4 0 but the examples below use async await which is only supported in node v7 6 0 or greater puppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks you create an instance of browser open pages and then manipulate them with puppeteers api example navigating to https example com and saving a screenshot as example png save file as example js js const puppeteer require puppeteer async const browser await puppeteer launch const page await browser newpage await page goto https example com await page screenshot path example png await browser close execute script on the command line bash node example js puppeteer sets an initial page size to 800px x 600px which defines the screenshot size the page size can be customized with page setviewport example create a pdf save file as hn js js const puppeteer require puppeteer async const browser await puppeteer launch const page await browser newpage await page goto https news ycombinator com waituntil networkidle2 await page pdf path hn pdf format a4 await browser close execute script on the command line bash node hn js see page pdf for more information about creating pdfs example evaluate script in the context of the page save file as get dimensions js js const puppeteer require puppeteer async const browser await puppeteer launch const page await browser newpage await page goto https example com get the viewport of the page as reported by the page const dimensions await page evaluate return width document documentelement clientwidth height document documentelement clientheight devicescalefactor window devicepixelratio console log dimensions dimensions await browser close execute script on the command line bash node get dimensions js see page evaluate for more information on evaluate and related methods like evaluateonnewdocument and exposefunction end getstarted start runtimesettings default runtime settings 1 uses headless mode puppeteer launches chromium in headless mode to launch a full version of chromium set the headless option when launching a browser js const browser await puppeteer launch headless false default is true 2 runs a bundled version of chromium by default puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of chromium so its api is guaranteed to work out of the box to use puppeteer with a different version of chrome or chromium pass in the executables path when creating a browser instance js const browser await puppeteer launch executablepath path to chrome see puppeteer launch for more information see this article for a description of the differences between chromium and chrome this article describes some differences for linux users 3 creates a fresh user profile puppeteer creates its own chromium user profile which it cleans up on every run end runtimesettings api documentation explore the api documentation and examples to learn more start debugging debugging tips turn off headless mode sometimes its useful to see what the browser is displaying instead of launching in headless mode launch a full version of the browser using headless false const browser await puppeteer launch headless false slow it down the slowmo option slows down puppeteer operations by the specified amount of milliseconds its another way to help see whats going on const browser await puppeteer launch headless false slowmo 250 slow down by 250ms capture console output you can listen for the console event this is also handy when debugging code in page evaluate page on console msg console log page log msg text await page evaluate console log url is location href stop test execution and use a debugger in browser use devtools true when launching puppeteer const browser await puppeteer launch devtools true change default test timeout jest jest settimeout 100000 jasmine jasmine default timeout interval 100000 mocha this timeout 100000 dont forget to change test to use function and not add an evaluate statement with debugger inside add debugger to an existing evaluate statement await page evaluate debugger the test will now stop executing in the above evaluate statement and chromium will stop in debug mode enable verbose logging all public api calls and internal protocol traffic will be logged via the debug module under the puppeteer namespace basic verbose logging env debug puppeteer node script js debug output can be enabled disabled by namespace env debug puppeteer puppeteer protocol node script js everything but protocol messages env debug puppeteer session node script js protocol session messages protocol messages to targets env debug puppeteer mouse puppeteer keyboard node script js only mouse and keyboard api calls protocol traffic can be rather noisy this example filters out all network domain messages env debug puppeteer env debug colors true node script js 2 1 grep v network end debugging contributing to puppeteer check out contributing guide to get an overview of puppeteer development start faq faq q who maintains puppeteer the chrome devtools team maintains the library but wed love your help and expertise on the project see contributing q what are puppeteers goals and principles the goals of the project are provide a slim canonical library that highlights the capabilities of the devtools protocol provide a reference implementation for similar testing libraries eventually these other frameworks could adopt puppeteer as their foundational layer grow the adoption of headless automated browser testing help dogfood new devtools protocol features and catch bugs learn more about the pain points of automated browser testing and help fill those gaps we adapt chromium principles to help us drive product decisions speed puppeteer has almost zero performance overhead over an automated page security puppeteer operates off process with respect to chromium making it safe to automate potentially malicious pages stability puppeteer should not be flaky and should not leak memory simplicity puppeteer provides a high level api thats easy to use understand and debug q is puppeteer replacing selenium webdriver no both projects are valuable for very different reasons selenium webdriver focuses on cross browser automation its value proposition is a single standard api that works across all major browsers puppeteer focuses on chromium its value proposition is richer functionality and higher reliability that said you can use puppeteer to run tests against chromium e g using the community driven jest puppeteer while this probably shouldnt be your only testing solution it does have a few good points compared to webdriver puppeteer requires zero setup and comes bundled with the chromium version it works best with making it very easy to start with at the end of the day its better to have a few tests running chromium only than no tests at all puppeteer has event driven architecture which removes a lot of potential flakiness theres no need for evil “sleep 1000 ” calls in puppeteer scripts puppeteer runs headless by default which makes it fast to run puppeteer v1 5 0 also exposes browser contexts making it possible to efficiently parallelize test execution puppeteer shines when it comes to debugging flip the “headless” bit to false add “slowmo” and youll see what the browser is doing you can even open chrome devtools to inspect the test environment q why doesnt puppeteer v xxx work with chromium v yyy we see puppeteer as an indivisible entity with chromium each version of puppeteer bundles a specific version of chromium – the only version it is guaranteed to work with this is not an artificial constraint a lot of work on puppeteer is actually taking place in the chromium repository heres a typical story a puppeteer bug is reported https github com googlechrome puppeteer issues 2709 it turned out this is an issue with the devtools protocol so were fixing it in chromium https chromium review googlesource com c chromium src 1102154 once the upstream fix is landed we roll updated chromium into puppeteer https github com googlechrome puppeteer pull 2769 however oftentimes it is desirable to use puppeteer with the official google chrome rather than chromium for this to work you should pick the version of puppeteer that uses the chromium version close enough to chrome q which chromium version does puppeteer use look for chromium revision in package json q whats considered a “navigation” from puppeteers standpoint “navigation” is anything that changes a pages url aside from regular navigation where the browser hits the network to fetch a new document from the web server this includes anchor navigations and history api usage with this definition of “navigation ” puppeteer works seamlessly with single page applications q whats the difference between a “trusted and untrusted input event in browsers input events could be divided into two big groups trusted vs untrusted trusted events events generated by users interacting with the page e g using a mouse or keyboard untrusted event events generated by web apis e g document createevent or element click methods websites can distinguish between these two groups using an event istrusted event flag sniffing for accompanying events for example every trusted click event is preceded by mousedown and mouseup events for automation purposes its important to generate trusted events all input events generated with puppeteer are trusted and fire proper accompanying events if for some reason one needs an untrusted event its always possible to hop into a page context with page evaluate and generate a fake event js await page evaluate document queryselector button type submit click q what features does puppeteer not support you may find that puppeteer does not behave as expected when controlling pages that incorporate audio and video for example video playback screenshots is likely to fail there are two reasons for this puppeteer is bundled with chromium not chrome and so by default it inherits all of chromiums media related limitations this means that puppeteer does not support licensed formats such as aac or h 264 however it is possible to force puppeteer to use a separately installed version chrome instead of chromium via the executablepath option to puppeteer launch you should only use this configuration if you need an official release of chrome that supports these media formats since puppeteer in all configurations controls a desktop version of chromium chrome features that are only supported by the mobile version of chrome are not supported this means that puppeteer does not support http live streaming hls q i am having trouble installing running puppeteer in my test environment we have a troubleshooting guide for various operating systems that lists the required dependencies q how do i try test a prerelease version of puppeteer you can check out this repo or install the latest prerelease from npm bash npm i save puppeteer next please note that prerelease may be unstable and contain bugs q i have more questions where do i ask there are many ways to get help on
