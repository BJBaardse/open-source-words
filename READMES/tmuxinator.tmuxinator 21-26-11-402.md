tmuxinator create and manage tmux sessions easily installation gem install tmuxinator editor and shell tmuxinator uses your shells default editor for opening files if youre not sure what that is type bash echo editor for me that produces vim if you want to change your default editor simply put a line in bashrc that changes it mine looks like this export editor vim tmux the recommended version of tmux to use is 1 8 or later with the exception of 2 5 which is not supported see issue 536 for details your mileage may vary for earlier versions refer to the faq for any odd behaviour completion download the appropriate completion file from the repo and source the file the following are example where the completion file has been downloaded into bin bash add the following to your bashrc source bin tmuxinator bash zsh add the following to your zshrc source bin tmuxinator zsh fish move tmuxinator fish to your completions folder cp bin tmuxinator fish config fish completions usage a working knowledge of tmux is assumed you should understand what windows and panes are in tmux if not please consult the man pages for tmux create a project create or edit your projects with tmuxinator new project for editing you can also use tmuxinator open project new is aliased to o open e edit and n please note that dots cant be used in project names as tmux uses them internally to delimit between windows and panes your default editor editor is used to open the file if this is a new project you will see this default config yaml tmuxinator sample yml name sample root optional tmux socket socket name foo note that the pre and post options have been deprecated and will be replaced by project hooks project hooks runs on project start always on project start command run on project start the first time on project first start command run on project start after the first time on project restart command run on project exit detaching from tmux session on project exit command run on project stop on project stop command runs in each window and pane before window pane specific commands useful for setting up interpreter versions pre window rbenv shell 2 0 0 p247 pass command line options to tmux useful for specifying a different tmux conf tmux options f tmux mac conf change the command to call tmux this can be used by derivatives wrappers like byobu tmux command byobu specifies by name or index which window will be selected on project startup if not set the first window is used startup window logs windows editor layout main vertical panes vim guard server bundle exec rails s logs tail f log development log windows the windows option allows the specification of any number of tmux windows each window is denoted by a yaml array entry followed by a name and command to be run yaml windows editor vim window specific root an optional root option can be specified per window yaml name test root projects company windows small project root projects company small project panes start this start that this takes precedence over the main root option panes note that if you wish to use panes make sure that you do not have in your project name tmux uses to delimit between window and pane indices and tmuxinator uses the project name in combination with these indices to target the correct pane or window panes are optional and are children of window entries but unlike windows they do not need a name in the following example the editor window has 2 panes one running vim the other guard yaml windows editor layout main vertical panes vim guard the layout setting gets handed down to tmux directly so you can choose from one of the five standard layouts or specify your own please note the indentation here is deliberate yamls indentation rules can be confusing so if your config isnt working as expected please check the indentation for a more detailed explanation of why yaml behaves this way see this stack overflow question interpreter managers environment variables to use tmuxinator with rbenv rvm nvm etc use the pre window option yaml pre window rbenv shell 2 0 0 p247 these command s will run before any subsequent commands in all panes and windows custom session attachment you can set tmuxinator to skip auto attaching to the session by using the attach option yaml attach false if you want to attach to tmux in a non standard way e g for a program that makes use of tmux control mode like iterm2 you can run arbitrary commands by using a project hook yaml on project start tmux cc attach passing directly to send keys tmuxinator passes commands directly to send keys this differs from simply chaining commands together using or in that tmux will directly send the commands to a shell as if you typed them in this allows commands to be executed on a remote server over ssh for example to support this both the window and pane options can take an array as an argument yaml name sample root windows stats ssh stats example com tail f var log stats log logs layout main vertical panes logs ssh logs example com cd var logs tail f development log erb project files support erb for reusability across environments eg yaml root env my custom dir you can also pass arguments to your projects and access them with erb simple arguments are available in an array named args eg bash tmuxinator start project foo yaml tmuxinator project yml name project root args 0 you can also pass key value pairs using the format key value these will be available in a hash named settings eg bash tmuxinator start project workspace workspace todo yaml tmuxinator project yml name project root settings workspace starting a session this will fire up tmux with all the tabs and panes you configured start is aliased to s tmuxinator start project n name p project config if you use the optional name argument it will start a new tmux session with the custom name provided this is to enable reuse of a project without tmux session name collision if there is a tmuxinator yml file in the current working directory but not a named project file in tmuxinator tmuxinator will use the local file this is primarily intended to be used for sharing tmux configurations in complex development environments you can provide tmuxinator with a project config file using the optional project config argument e g project config path to my project yaml or p path to my project yaml this option will override a project name if provided and a local tmuxinator file if present shorthand the shell completion files also include a shorthand alias for tmuxinator that can be used in place of the full name mux command other commands copy an existing project aliased to c and cp tmuxinator copy existing new list all the projects you have configured aliased to l and ls tmuxinator list remove a project aliased to rm tmuxinator delete project remove all tmuxinator configs aliases and scripts aliased to i tmuxinator implode examines your environment and identifies problems with your configuration tmuxinator doctor shows tmuxinators help aliased to h tmuxinator help shows the shell commands that get executed for a project tmuxinator debug project shows tmuxinators version tmuxinator version project configuration location using environment variables its possible to house project configuration files in non standard directories see pr 511 tmuxinator will attempt to use the following environment variables in this order when creating or searching for existing project configuration files tmuxinator config xdg config home tmuxinator tmuxinator this behavior is opt in if you do nothing tmuxinator will continue to use tmuxinator when searching for existing project configuration files or creating new project configuration files faq window names are not displaying properly add
