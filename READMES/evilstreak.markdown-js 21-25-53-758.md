markdown js yet another markdown parser this time for javascript theres a few options that precede this project but they all treat markdown to html conversion as a single step process you pass markdown in and get html out end of story we had some pretty particular views on how the process should actually look which include producing well formed html this means that em and strong nesting is important as is the ability to output as both html and xhtml having an intermediate representation to allow processing of parsed data we in fact have two both jsonml a markdown tree and an html tree being easily extensible to add new dialects without having to rewrite the entire parsing mechanics having a good test suite the only test suites we could find tested massive blocks of input and passing depended on outputting the html with exactly the same whitespace as the original implementation installation just the markdown library npm install markdown optionally install md2html into your path npm install g markdown in the browser if you want to use from the browser go to the releases page on github and download the version you want minified or not usage the basic interface is js md content hello \n\n this is markdown \n it is fun\n love it or leave it html content markdown tohtml md content tohtml also accepts a dialect argument js md content vessel captain\n \nncc 1701 james t kirk\nncc 1701 a james t kirk\nncc 1701 d picard html content markdown tohtml md content maruku node the simple way to use it with node is js var markdown require markdown markdown console log markdown tohtml hello world es6 js import markdown from markdown console log markdown tohtml hello world older versions of node we only officially support node 0 10 as the libraries we use for building and testing dont work on older versions of node that said since this module is so simple and doesnt use any parts of the node api if you use the pre built version and find a bug let us know and well try and fix it browser it also works in a browser here is a complete example html doctype html html body textarea id text input oninput this editor update rows 6 cols 60 type markdown here textarea div id preview div script src lib markdown js script script function editor input preview this update function preview innerhtml markdown tohtml input value input editor this this update var function id return document getelementbyid id new editor text input preview script body html command line assuming youve installed the md2html script see installation above you can convert markdown to html bash read from a file md2html path to doc md path to doc html or from stdin echo hello world md2html more options if you want more control check out the documentation in the js files under src which details all the methods and parameters available including examples one day well get the docs generated and hosted somewhere for nicer browsing meanwhile heres an example of using the multi step processing to make wiki style linking work by filling in missing link references js var md require markdown markdown text markdown is a simple text based markup language \n created by john gruber \n\n john gruber http daringfireball net parse the markdown into a tree and grab the link references var tree md parse text refs tree 1 references iterate through the tree finding link references function find link refs jsonml if jsonml 0 link ref var ref jsonml 1 ref if theres no reference define a wiki link if refs ref refs ref href http en wikipedia org wiki ref replace \s else if array isarray jsonml 1 jsonml 1 foreach find link refs else if array isarray jsonml 2 jsonml 2 foreach find link refs tree convert the tree into html var html md renderjsonml md tohtmltree tree console log html intermediate representation internally the process to convert a chunk of markdown into a chunk of html has three steps parse the markdown into a jsonml tree any references found in the parsing are stored in the attribute hash of the root node under the key references convert the markdown tree into an html tree rename any nodes that need it bulletlist to ul for example and lookup any references used by links or images remove the references attribute once done stringify the html tree being careful not to wreck whitespace where whitespace is important surrounding inline elements for example each step of this process can be called individually if you need to do some processing or modification of the data at an intermediate stage for example you may want to grab a list of all urls linked to in the document before rendering it to html which you could do by recursing through the html tree looking for a nodes building and testing markdown js we use grunt to build and run markdown jss tests make sure you run npm install to install the developer dependencies for the project then you can npm test to run our test suite if youd like to build markdown js you can run node modules bin grunt all this command will run all the tests then output a concatenated markdown js and markdown min js in the dist directory for use in a browser application building a custom markdown js by default you will get the gruber and maruku dialects included when you run grunt all however you can create a custom build using the following syntax if you dont want to include maruku support node modules bin grunt custom dialects maruku running tests to run the tests under node you will need tap installed its listed as a devdependencies so npm install from the checkout should be enough then do npm test
