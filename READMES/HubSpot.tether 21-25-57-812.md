tether rotating light project status rotating light we at hubspot have been thrilled by tethers success however the demands of maintaining such a complex project have outstripped our willingness and ability to do so effectively as a quick glance at the issue tracker will tell you if youre a developer and youre looking for an alternative to tether check out popper js its maintainers have put a ton of work into it and its constantly getting better if youre with an organization would like to take ownership of tether reach out to us wed be happy to see this project in the hands of a team that can give it the love it deserves introduction tether is a small focused javascript library for defining and managing the position of user interface ui elements in relation to one another on a web page it is a tool for web developers building features that require certain ui elements to be precisely positioned based on the location of another ui element there are often situations in ui development where elements need to be attached to other elements but placing them right next to each other in the dom tree can be problematic based on the context for example what happens if the element were attaching other elements to is fixed to the center of the screen or what if the element is inside a scrollable container how can we prevent the attached element from being clipped as it disappears from view while a user is scrolling tether can solve all of these problems and more some common ui elements that have been built with tether are tooltips select menus dropdown menus and guided tours tether is flexible and can be used to solve all kinds of interesting problems it ensures ui elements stay where they need to be based on the various user interactions click scroll etc and layout contexts fixed positioning inside scrollable containers etc please have a look at the documentation for a more detailed explanation of why you might need tether for your next project what to use tether for and when to use it tether is a small focused javascript library for those who might be new to javascript a library is simply a javascript file or files that contain useful javascript code to help achieve tasks easier and faster since tether is a javascript user interface ui library it contains code to help you to manage the way your website or web app appears tethers goal to is to help you position your elements side by side when needed lets say youve started working on your dream project—a fancy web app thats sure to become the next big thing an important feature of your new app is to allow users to comment on shared photos however due to limited vertical space and the overall layout of your new app youd like to display the comments next to the image similar to how instagram does it your html code might look something like this html div class container img src awesome picture jpg alt awesome picture class picture div class comments div div now you could achieve this with some css using its position property but going this route can be problematic since many of positions values take elements out of the natural dom flow for example if you have an element at the bottom of your html document using position absolute or position fixed might could move it all the way to the top of your website in the browser not only that but you also have to make manual adjustments to ensure other elements arent negatively affected by the positioned elements not to mention you probably want your comment box to be responsive and look good across different device sizes coding a solution for this manually is a challenge all on its own enter tether after installing tether and including it in your project you can begin using it in your javascript file create a new instance or
