vlayout 中文文档 projects of tangram android tangram android virtualview android vlayout ultraviewpager ios tangram ios virtualview ios lazyscrollview project vlayout is a powerful layoutmanager extension for recyclerview it provides a group of layouts for recyclerview make it able to handle a complicate situation when grid list and other layouts in the same recyclerview design by providing a custom layoutmanager to recyclerview virtuallayout is able to layout child views with different style at single view elegantly the custom layoutmanager manages a serial of layouthelpers where each one implements the specific layout logic for a certain position range items by the way implementing your custom layouthelper and provding it to the framework is also supported main feature provide default common layout implementation decouple the view and layout default layout implementations are linearlayouthelper provide linear layout as linearlayoutmanager gridlayouthelper provide grid layout as gridlayoutmanager but with more feature fixlayouthelper fix the view at certain position of screen the view does not scroll with whole page scrollfixlayouthelper fix the view at certain position of screen but the view does not show until it scrolls to it position floatlayouthelper float the view on top of page user can drag and drop it columnlayouthelper perform like gridlayouthelper but layouts all child views in one line singlelayouthelper contain only one child view oneplusnlayouthelper a custom layout with one child view layouted at left and the others at right you may not need this stickylayouthelper scroll the view when its position is inside the screen but fix the view at start or end when its position is outside the screen staggeredgridlayouthelper provide waterfall like layout as staggeredgridlayoutmanager layouthelpers provided by default can be generally divided into two categories one is non fix layouthelper such as linearlayouthelper gridlayouthelper etc which means the children of these layouthelper will be layouted in the flow of parent container and will be scrolled with the container scrolling while the other is fix layouthelper which means the child of these is always fix in parent container usage import library please find the latest version in release notes the newest version has been upload to jcenter and mavencentral make sure you have added at

recyclerview since the default value may not meet your situation and cause re create views when scrolling java recyclerview recycledviewpool viewpool new recyclerview recycledviewpool recyclerview setrecycledviewpool viewpool viewpool setmaxrecycledviews 0 10 attention the demo code above only modify the recycle pool size of item with type 0 it you has more than one type in your adapter you should update recycle pool size for each type set adapters you can use delegateadapter for as a root adapter to make combination of your own adapters just make it extend delegateadapter adapter and overrides oncreatelayouthelper method java delegateadapter delegateadapter new delegateadapter layoutmanager hasconsistitemtype recycler setadapter delegateadapter then you can set sub adapters delegateadapter setadapters adapters or customadapter adapter new customadapter data new gridlayouthelper delegateadapter addadapter adapter call notify change when data changes adapter notifydatasetchanged attention when hasconsistitemtype true items with same type value in different sub adapters share the same type their view would be reused during scroll when hasconsistitemtype false items with same type value in different sub adapters do not share the same type internally the other way to set adapter is extending virtuallayoutadapter and implementing it to make deep combination to your business code java public class myadapter extends virtuallayoutadapter myadapter myadapter new myadapter layoutmanager create layouthelper list list helpers new linkedlist gridlayouthelper gridlayouthelper new gridlayouthelper 4 gridlayouthelper setitemcount 25 helpers add gridlayouthelper gridlayouthelper gridlayouthelper2 new gridlayouthelper 2 gridlayouthelper2 setitemcount 25 helpers add gridlayouthelper2 set layouthelper list to adapter myadapter setlayouthelpers helpers set adapter to recyclerview recycler setadapter myadapter in this way one thing you should note is that you should call setlayouthelpers when the data of adapter changes config proguard add following configs in your proguard file if your app is released with proguard keepattributes
