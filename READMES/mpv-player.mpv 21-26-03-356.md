mpv external links overview system requirements downloads changelog compilation ffmpeg vs libav ffmpeg abi compatibility release cycle bug reports contributing relation to mplayer and mplayer2 license contact external links wiki faq manual overview mpv is a media player based on mplayer and mplayer2 it supports a wide variety of video file formats audio and video codecs and subtitle types releases can be found on the release list system requirements a not too ancient linux windows 7 or later or osx 10 8 or later a somewhat capable cpu hardware decoding might help if the cpu is too slow to decode video in realtime but must be explicitly enabled with the hwdec option a not too crappy gpu mpv is not intended to be used with bad gpus there are many caveats with drivers or system compositors causing tearing stutter etc on windows you might want to make sure the graphics drivers are current in some cases ancient fallback video output methods can help such as vo xv on linux but this use is not recommended or supported downloads for semi official builds and third party packages please see mpv io installation changelog there is no complete changelog however changes to the player core interface are listed in the interface changelog changes to the c api are documented in the client api changelog the release list has a summary of most of the important changes on every release changes to the default key bindings are indicated in restore old bindings conf compilation compiling with full features requires development files for several external libraries below is a list of some important requirements the mpv build system uses waf but we dont store it in the repository the bootstrap py script will download the latest version of waf that was tested with the build system for a list of the available build options use waf configure help if you think you have support for some feature installed but configure fails to detect it the file build config log may contain information about the reasons for the failure note to avoid cluttering the output with unreadable spam help only shows one of the two switches for each option if the option is autodetected by default the disable switch is printed if the option is disabled by default the enable switch is printed either way you can use enable or disable regardless of what is printed by help to build the software you can use waf build the result of the compilation will be located in build mpv you can use waf install to install mpv to the prefix after it is compiled example bootstrap py waf configure waf waf install essential dependencies incomplete list gcc or clang x development headers xlib xrandr xext xscrnsaver xinerama libvdpau libgl glx egl xv audio output development headers libasound alsa pulseaudio ffmpeg libraries libavutil libavcodec libavformat libswscale libavfilter and either libswresample or libavresample zlib iconv normally provided by the system libc libass osd osc text subtitles lua optional required for the osc pseudo gui and youtube dl integration libjpeg optional used for screenshots only uchardet optional for subtitle charset detection vdpau and vaapi libraries for hardware decoding on linux optional libass dependencies gcc or clang yasm on x86 and x86 64 fribidi freetype fontconfig development headers for libass harfbuzz optional required for correct rendering of combining characters particularly for correct rendering of non english text on osx and arabic indic scripts on any platform ffmpeg dependencies gcc or clang yasm on x86 and x86 64 openssl or gnutls have to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg libx264 libmp3lame libfdk aac if you want to use encoding have to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg for native dash playback ffmpeg needs to be built with enable libxml2 although there are security implications for good nvidia support on linux make sure nv codec headers is installed and can be found by configure libav support is broken see section below most of the above libraries are available in suitable versions on normal linux distributions for ease of compiling the latest git master of everything you may wish to use the separately available build wrapper mpv build which first compiles ffmpeg libraries and libass and then compiles the player statically linked against those if you want to build a windows binary you either have to use msys2 and mingw or cross compile from linux with mingw see windows compilation ffmpeg vs libav generally mpv should work with the latest release as well as the git version of ffmpeg libav support is currently broken because they did not add certain ffmpeg api changes which mpv relies on ffmpeg abi compatibility mpv does not support linking against ffmpeg versions it was not built with even if the linked version is supposedly abi compatible with the version it was compiled against expect malfunctions crashes and security issues if you do it anyway the reason for not supporting this is because it creates far too much complexity with little to no benefit coupled with absurd and unusable ffmpeg api artifacts newer mpv versions will refuse to start if runtime and compile time ffmpeg library versions mismatch release cycle every other month an arbitrary git snapshot is made and is assigned a 0 x 0 version number no further maintenance is done the goal of releases is to make linux distributions happy linux distributions are also expected to apply their own patches in case of bugs and security issues releases other than the latest release are unsupported and unmaintained see the release policy document for more information bug reports please use the issue tracker provided by github to send us bug reports or feature requests follow the templates instructions or the issue will likely be ignored or closed as invalid using the bug tracker as place for simple questions is fine but irc is recommended see contact below contributing please read contribute md for small changes you can just send us pull requests through github for bigger changes come and talk to us on irc before you start working on them it will make code review easier for both parties later on you can check the wiki or the issue tracker for ideas on what you could contribute with relation to mplayer and mplayer2 mpv is a fork of mplayer much has changed and in general mpv should be considered a completely new program rather than a mplayer drop in replacement for details see faq entry if you are wondering whats different from mplayer2 and mplayer an incomplete and largely unmaintained list of changes is located here license gplv2 or later by default lgplv2 1 or later with enable lgpl see details contact most activity happens on the irc channel and the github issue tracker github issue tracker issue tracker report bugs here user irc channel mpv on irc freenode net developer irc channel mpv devel on irc freenode net to contact the mpv team in
