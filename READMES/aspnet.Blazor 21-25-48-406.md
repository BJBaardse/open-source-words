blazor an experimental net web framework using c razor and html that runs in the browser via webassembly blazor is a net web framework that runs in any browser you author blazor apps using c razor and html blazor uses only the latest web standards no plugins or transpilation needed it runs in the browser on a real net runtime mono implemented in webassembly that executes normal net assemblies it works in older browsers too by falling back to an asm js based net runtime blazor will have all the features of a modern web framework including a component model for building composable ui routing layouts forms and validation dependency injection javascript interop live reloading in the browser during development server side rendering full net debugging both in browsers and in the ide rich intellisense and tooling ability to run on older non webassembly browsers via asm js publishing and app size trimming note blazor is an experimental project its not yet a committed product this is to allow time to fully investigate the technical issues associated with running net in the browser and to ensure we can build something that developers love and can be productive with during this experimental phase we expect to engage deeply with early blazor adopters like you to hear your feedback and suggestions to see blazor in action check out steve sandersons demo at ndc minnesota you can also try out a simple live blazor app getting started to get started with blazor and build your first blazor web app check out our getting started guide building the repo prerequisites node js 8 3 the
