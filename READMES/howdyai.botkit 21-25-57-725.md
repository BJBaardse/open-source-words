bot the goal of botkit is to make it easier and more fun to build software that talks and works like a robot building a bot should feel cool and not too technically complicated botkit handles all the nitty gritty details like api calls session management and authentication allowing you to focus on building cool features for your bot using middleware and event handlers the toolkit is designed to provide meaningful building blocks for creating conversational user interfaces with functions like hears ask and reply that do what they say they do hearing keywords most bots do their thing by listening for keywords phrases or patterns in messages from users botkit has a special event handler called hears that makes it easy to configure your bot to listen for this type of trigger controller hears string pattern new regexp i message received other event function bot message do something bot reply message i heard a message read more about hearing things › responding to events bots can respond to non verbal events as well like when a new user joins a channel a file gets uploaded or a button gets clicked these events are handled using an event handling pattern that should look familiar most events in botkit can be replied to like normal messages controller on channel join function bot message bot reply message welcome to the channel see a full list of events and more information about handling them › middleware in addition to taking direct action in response to a certain message or type of event botkit can also take passive action on messages as they move through the application using middlewares middleware functions work by changing messages adding new fields firing alternate events and modifying or overriding the behavior of botkits core features middleware can be used to adjust how botkit receives processes and sends messages here is a list of available middleware endpoints log every message recieved controller middleware receive use function bot message next log it console log received message modify the message message logged true continue processing the message next log every message sent controller middleware send use function bot message
