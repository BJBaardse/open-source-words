introduction seafile is an open source cloud storage system with privacy protection and teamwork features collections of files are called libraries each library can be synced separately a library can also be encrypted with a user chosen password seafile also allows users to create groups and easily sharing files into groups feature summary seafile has the following features file syncing selective sync for any folder correctly handles file conflicts based on history instead of timestamp only transfer content delta to the server interrupted transfers can be resumed sync with two or more servers sync with existing folders file sharing and collaboration sharing folders between users or into groups download links with password protection upload links version control with configurable revision number restoring deleted files from trash history or snapshots privacy protection library encryption with a user chosen password client side encryption when using the desktop syncing internal seafiles version control model is similar to git but it is simplified for automatic synchronization each seafile library behaves like a git repository it has its own unique history which consists of a list of commits a commit points to the root of a file system snapshot the snapshot consists of directories and files files are further divided into blocks for more efficient network transfer and storage usage however seafile doesnt rely on git to run source repositories for seafile components each component of seafile has its own source code repository on github sync client daemon this repository https github com haiwen seafile sync client gui https github com haiwen seafile client server core https github com haiwen seafile server server web ui https github com haiwen seahub ios app https github com haiwen seafile ios android app https github com haiwen seadroid webdav https github com haiwen seafdav before version 6 0 the source code of sync client daemon and server core are mixed together in https github com haiwen seafile but after 6 0 version the server core is separated into its own repository for this reason the sync client daemon repository is still the front page for seafile project on github build and run see http manual seafile com build seafile server html bug and feature request reports please only submit bugs in github issues pro customers should contact us via email server and web interface seahub https github com haiwen seafile issues desktop client https github com haiwen seafile client issues android client https github com haiwen seadroid issues ios client https github com haiwen seafile ios issues feature requests and installation usage problem should be asked in the forum https forum seafile com internationalization i18n translate seafile web ui translate seafile desktop client translate seafile android app translate seafile ios app change logs see https seacloud cc group 3 wiki home roadmap changelogs why open source our primary goal is to build a first class product we think this goal can only be achieved by collaborating with the whole world contributing for more informations read contribution license seafile ios client apache license v2 seafile android client gplv3 desktop syncing client this repository gplv2 seafile server core agplv3 seahub seafile server web ui apache license v2 contact twitter seafile https twitter com seafile forum https forum seafile com
