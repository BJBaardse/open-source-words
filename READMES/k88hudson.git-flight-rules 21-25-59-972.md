coloring for git ive no idea what i did wrong other resources books tutorials scripts and tools gui clients end doctoc generated toc please keep comment here to allow auto update repositories i want to start a local repository to initialize an existing directory as a git repository sh my folder git init i want to clone a remote repository to clone copy a remote repository copy the url for the repository and run sh git clone url this will save it to a folder named the same as the remote repositorys make sure you have connection to the remote server you are cloning from for most purposes this means making sure you are connected to the internet to clone it into a folder with a different name than the default repository name sh git clone url name of new folder editing commits what did i just commit lets say that you just blindly committed changes with git commit a and youre not sure what the actual content of the commit you just made was you can show the latest commit on your current head with sh master git show or sh git log n1 p if you want to see a file at a specific commit you can also do this where commitid is the commit youre interested in sh git show commitid filename i wrote the wrong thing in a commit message if you wrote the wrong thing and the commit has not yet been pushed you can do the following to change the commit message sh git commit amend this will open your default text editor where you can edit the message on the other hand you can do this all in one command sh git commit amend m xxxxxxx if you have already pushed the message you can amend the commit and force push but this is not recommended i committed with the wrong name and email configured if its a single commit amend it sh git commit amend no edit author new authorname authoremail mydomain com an alternative is to correctly configure your author settings in git config global author name email and then use sh git commit amend reset author no edit if you need to change all of history see the man page for git filter branch i want to remove a file from the previous commit in order to remove changes for a file from the previous commit do the following sh git checkout head myfile git add myfile git commit amend no edit in case the file was newly added to the commit and you want to remove it from git alone do sh git rm cached myfile git commit amend no edit this is particularly useful when you have an open patch and you have committed an unnecessary file and need to force push to update the patch on a remote the no edit option is used to keep the existing commit message i want to delete or remove my last commit if you need to delete pushed commits you can use the following however it will irreversibly change your history and mess up the history of anyone else who had already pulled from the repository in short if youre not sure you should never do this ever sh git reset head hard git push force with lease remote branch if you havent pushed to reset git to the state it was in before you made your last commit while keeping your staged changes my branch git reset soft head 1 this only works if you havent pushed if you have pushed the only truly safe thing to do is git revert shaofbadcommit that will create a new commit that undoes all the previous commits changes or if the branch you pushed to is rebase safe ie other devs arent expected to pull from it you can just use git push force with lease for more see the above section delete remove arbitrary commit the same warning applies as above never do this if possible sh git rebase onto sha1 of bad commit sha1 of bad commit git push force with lease remote branch or do an interactive rebase and remove the line s corresponding to commit s you want to see removed i tried to push my amended commit to a remote but i got an error message sh to https github com yourusername repo git rejected mybranch mybranch non fast forward error failed to push some refs to https github com tanay1337 webmaker org git hint updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint its remote counterpart integrate the remote changes e g hint git pull before pushing again hint see the note about fast forwards in git push help for details note that as with rebasing see below amending replaces the old commit with a new one so you must force push force with lease your changes if you have already pushed the pre amended commit to your remote be careful when you do this ‚Äì always make sure you specify a branch sh my branch git push origin mybranch force with lease in general avoid force pushing it is best to create and push a new commit rather than force pushing the amended commit as it will cause conflicts in the source history for any other developer who has interacted with the branch in question or any child branches force with lease will still fail if someone else was also working on the same branch as you and your push would overwrite those changes if you are absolutely sure that nobody is working on the same branch or you want to update the tip of the branch unconditionally you can use force f but this should be avoided in general i accidentally did a hard reset and i want my changes back if you accidentally do git reset hard you can normally still get your commit back as git keeps a log of everything for a few days note this is only valid if your work is backed up i e either committed or stashed git reset hard will remove uncommitted modifications so use it with caution a safer option is git reset keep sh master git reflog youll see a list of your past commits and a commit for the reset choose the sha of the commit you want to return to and reset again sh master git reset hard sha1234 and you should be good to go staging i need to add staged changes to the previous commit sh my branch git commit amend i want to stage part of a new file but not the whole file normally if you want to stage part of a file you run this sh git add patch filename x p will work for short this will open interactive mode you would be able to use the s option to split the commit however if the file is new you will not have this option to add a new file do this sh git add n filename x then you will need to use the e option to manually choose which lines to add running git diff cached or git diff staged will show you which lines you have staged compared to which are still saved locally i want to add changes in one file to two different commits git add will add the entire file to a commit git add p will allow to interactively select which changes you want to add i want to stage my unstaged edits and unstage my staged edits this is tricky the best i figure is that you should stash your unstaged edits then reset after that pop your stashed edits back and add them sh git stash k git reset hard git stash pop git add a unstaged edits i want to move my unstaged edits to a new branch sh git checkout b my branch i want to move my unstaged edits to a different existing branch sh git stash git checkout my branch git stash pop i want to discard my local uncommitted changes staged and unstaged if you want to discard all your local staged and unstaged changes you can do this sh my branch git reset hard or master git checkout f this will unstage all files you might have staged with git add sh git reset this will revert all local uncommitted changes should be executed in repo root sh git checkout you can also revert uncommitted changes to a particular file or directory sh git checkout some dir file txt yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes longer to type but works from any subdirectory sh git reset hard head this will remove all local untracked files so only files tracked by git remain sh git clean fd x will also remove all ignored files i want to discard specific unstaged changes when you want to get rid of some but not all changes in your working copy checkout undesired changes keep good changes sh git checkout p answer y to all of the snippets you want to drop another strategy involves using stash stash all the good changes reset working copy and reapply good changes sh git stash p select all of the snippets you want to save git reset hard git stash pop alternatively stash your undesired changes and then drop stash sh git stash p select all of the snippets you dont want to save git stash drop i want to discard specific unstaged files when you want to get rid of one specific file in your working copy sh git checkout myfile alternatively to discard multiple files in your working copy list them all sh git checkout myfirstfile mysecondfile i want to discard only my unstaged local changes when you want to get rid of all of your unstaged local uncommitted changes sh git checkout i want to discard all of my untracked files when you want to get rid of all of your untracked files sh git clean f branches i want to list all branches list local branches sh git branch list remote branches sh git branch r list all branches both local and remote sh git branch a create a branch from a commit sh git checkout b branch sha1 of commit i pulled from into the wrong branch this is another chance to use git reflog to see where your head pointed before the bad pull sh master git reflog ab7555f head 0 pull origin wrong branch fast forward c5bc55a head 1 checkout checkout message goes here simply reset your branch back to the desired commit sh git reset hard c5bc55a done i want to discard local commits so my branch is the same as one on the server confirm that you havent pushed your changes to the server git status should show how many commits you are ahead of origin sh my branch git status on branch my branch your branch is ahead of origin my branch by 2 commits use git push to publish your local commits one way of resetting to match origin to have the same as what is on the remote is to do this sh master git reset hard origin my branch i committed to master instead of a new branch create the new branch while remaining on master sh master git branch my branch reset the branch master to the previous commit sh master git reset hard head head is short for head 1 this stands for the first parent of head similarly head 2 stands for the second parent of the commit merges can have 2 parents note that head 2 is not the same as head 2 see this link for more information alternatively if you dont want to use head find out what the commit hash you want to set your master branch to git log should do the trick then reset to that hash git push will make sure that this change is reflected on your remote for example if the hash of the commit that your master branch is supposed to be at is a13b85e sh master git reset hard a13b85e head is now at a13b85e checkout the new branch to continue working sh master git checkout my branch i want to keep the whole file from another ref ish say you have a working spike see note with hundreds of changes everything is working now you commit into another branch to save that work sh solution git add a git commit m adding all changes from this spike into one big commit when you want to put it into a branch maybe feature maybe develop youre interested in keeping whole files you want to split your big commit into smaller ones say you have branch solution with the solution to your spike one ahead of develop branch develop where you want to add your changes you can solve it bringing the contents to your branch sh develop git checkout solution file1 txt this will get the contents of that file in branch solution to your branch develop sh on branch develop your branch is up to date with origin develop changes to be committed use git reset head to unstage modified file1 txt then commit as usual note spike solutions are made to analyze or solve the problem these solutions are used for estimation and discarded once everyone gets clear visualization of the problem wikipedia i made several commits on a single branch that should be on different branches say you are on your master branch running git log you see you have made two commits sh master git log commit e3851e817c451cc36f2e6f3049db528415e3c114 author alex lee alexlee example com date tue jul 22 15 39 27 2014 0400 bug 21 added csrf protection commit 5ea51731d150f7ddc4a365437931cd8be3bf3131 author alex lee alexlee example com date tue jul 22 15 39 12 2014 0400 bug 14 fixed

e3851e8 for 21 5ea5173 for 14 first lets reset our master branch to the correct commit a13b85e sh master git reset hard a13b85e head is now at a13b85e now we can create a fresh branch for our bug 21 sh master git checkout b 21 21 now lets cherry pick the commit for bug 21 on top of our branch that means we will be applying that commit and only that commit directly on top of whatever our head is at sh 21 git cherry pick e3851e8 at this point there is a possibility there might be conflicts see the there were conflicts section in the interactive rebasing section above for how to resolve conflicts now lets create a new branch for bug 14 also based on master sh 21 git checkout master master git checkout b 14 14 and finally lets cherry pick the commit for bug 14 sh 14 git cherry pick 5ea5173 i want to delete local branches that were deleted upstream once you merge a pull request on github it gives you the option to delete the merged branch in your fork if you arent planning to keep working on the branch its cleaner to delete the local copies of the branch so you dont end up cluttering up your working checkout with a lot of stale branches sh git fetch p upstream where upstream is the remote you want to fetch from i accidentally deleted my branch if youre regularly pushing to remote you should be safe most of the time but still sometimes you may end up deleting your branches lets say we create a branch and create a new file sh master git checkout b my branch my branch git branch my branch touch foo txt my branch ls readme md foo txt lets add it and commit sh my branch git add my branch git commit m foo txt added my branch foo txt added 1 files changed 1 insertions create mode 100644 foo txt my branch git log commit 4e3cd85a670ced7cc17a2b5d8d3d809ac88d5012

2014 0400 fixes 6 force pushing after amending commits now were switching back to master and accidentally removing our branch sh my branch git checkout master switched to branch master your branch is up to date with origin master master git branch d my branch deleted branch my branch was 4e3cd85 master echo oh noes deleted my branch oh noes deleted my branch at this point you should get familiar with reflog an upgraded logger it stores the history of all the action in the repo master git reflog 69204cd head 0 checkout moving from my branch to master 4e3cd85 head 1 commit foo txt added 69204cd head 2 checkout moving from master to my branch as you can see we have commit hash from our deleted branch lets see if we can restore our deleted branch sh master git checkout b my branch help switched to a new branch my branch help my branch help git reset hard 4e3cd85 head is now at 4e3cd85 foo txt added my branch help ls readme md foo txt voila we got our removed file back git reflog is also useful when rebasing goes terribly wrong i want to delete a branch to delete a remote branch sh master git push origin delete my branch you can also do sh master git push origin my branch to delete a local branch sh master git branch d my branch to delete a local branch that has not been merged to the current branch or an upstream sh master git branch d my branch i want to delete multiple branches say you want to delete all branches that start with fix sh master git branch grep fix xargs git branch d i want to rename a branch to rename the current local branch sh master git branch m new name to rename a different local branch sh master git branch m old name new name i want to checkout to a remote branch that someone else is working on first fetch all branches from remote sh master git fetch all say you want to checkout to daves from the remote sh master git checkout track origin daves branch daves set up to track remote branch daves from origin switched to a new branch daves track is shorthand for git checkout b branch remotename branch this will give you a local copy of the branch daves and any update that has been pushed will also show up remotely i want to create a new remote branch from current local one sh git push remote head if you would also like to set that remote branch as upstream for the current one use the following instead sh git push u remote head with the upstream mode and the simple default in git 2 0 mode of the push default config the following command will push the current branch with regards to the remote branch that has been registered previously with u sh git push the behavior of the other modes of git push is described in the doc of push default i want to set a remote branch as the upstream for a local branch you can set a remote branch as the upstream for the current local branch using sh git branch set upstream to remotename branch or using the shorthand git branch u remotename branch to set the upstream remote branch for another local branch sh git branch u remotename branch local branch i want to set my head to track the default remote branch by checking your remote branches you can see which remote branch your head is tracking in some cases this is not the desired branch sh git branch r origin head origin gh pages origin master to change origin head to track origin master you can run this command sh git remote set head origin auto origin head set to master i made changes on the wrong branch youve made uncommitted changes and realise youre on the wrong branch stash changes and apply them to the branch you want sh wrong branch git stash wrong branch git checkout correct branch correct branch git stash apply rebasing and merging i want to undo rebase merge you may have merged or rebased your current branch with a wrong branch or you cant figure it out or finish the rebase merge process git saves the original head pointer in a variable called orig head before doing dangerous operations so it is simple to recover your branch at the state before the rebase merge sh my branch git reset hard orig head i rebased but i dont want to force push unfortunately you have to force push if you want those changes to be reflected on the remote branch this is because you have changed the history the remote branch wont accept changes unless you force push this is one of the main reasons many people use a merge workflow instead of a rebasing workflow large teams can get into trouble with developers force pushing use this with caution a safer way to use rebase is not to reflect your changes on the remote branch at all and instead to do the following sh master git checkout my branch my branch git rebase i master my branch git checkout master master git merge ff only my branch for more see this so thread i need to combine commits lets suppose you are working in a branch that is will become a pull request against master in the simplest case when all you want to do is to combine all commits into a single one and you dont care about commit timestamps you can reset and recommit make sure the master branch is up to date and all your changes committed then sh my branch git reset soft master my branch git commit am new awesome feature if you want more control and also to preserve timestamps you need to do something called an interactive rebase sh my branch git rebase i master if you arent working against another branch youll have to rebase relative to your head if you want to squash the last 2 commits for example youll have to rebase against head 2 for the last 3 head 3 etc sh master git rebase i head 2 after you run the interactive rebase command you will see something like this in your text editor vim pick a9c8a1d some refactoring pick 01b2fd8 new awesome feature pick b729ad5 fixup pick e3851e8 another fix rebase 8074d12 b729ad5 onto 8074d12 commands p pick use commit r reword use commit but edit the commit message e edit use commit but stop for amending s squash use commit but meld into previous commit f fixup like squash but discard this commits log message x exec run command the rest of the line using shell these lines can be re ordered they are executed from top to bottom if you remove a line here that commit will be lost however if you remove everything the rebase will be aborted note that empty commits are commented out all the lines beginning with a are comments they wont affect your rebase then you replace pick commands with any in the list above and you can also remove commits by removing corresponding lines for example if you want to leave the oldest first commit alone and combine all the following commits with the second oldest you should edit the letter next to each commit except the first and the second to say f vim pick a9c8a1d some refactoring pick 01b2fd8 new awesome feature f b729ad5 fixup f e3851e8 another fix if you want to combine these commits and rename the commit you should additionally add an r next to the second commit or simply use s instead of f vim pick a9c8a1d some refactoring pick 01b2fd8 new awesome feature s b729ad5 fixup s e3851e8 another fix you can then rename the commit in the next text prompt that pops up vim newer awesomer features please enter the commit message for your changes lines starting with will be ignored and an empty message aborts the commit rebase in progress onto 8074d12 you are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch master on 8074d12 changes to be committed modified readme md if everything is successful you should see something like this sh master successfully rebased and updated refs heads master safe merging strategy no commit performs the merge but pretends the merge failed and does not autocommit giving the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing no ff maintains evidence that a feature branch once existed keeping project history consistent sh master git merge no ff no commit my branch i need to merge a branch into a single commit sh master git merge squash my branch i want to combine only unpushed commits sometimes you have several work in progress commits that you want to combine before you push them upstream you dont want to accidentally combine any commits that have already been pushed upstream because someone else may have already made commits that reference them sh master git rebase i u this will do an interactive rebase that lists only the commits that you havent already pushed so it will be safe to reorder fix squash anything in the list i need to abort the merge sometimes the merge can produce problems in certain files in those cases we can use the option abort to abort the current conflict resolution process and try to reconstruct the pre merge state sh my branch git merge abort this command is available since git version 1 7 4 check if all commits on a branch are merged to check if all commits on a branch are merged into another branch you should diff between the heads or any commits of those branches sh master git log graph left right cherry pick oneline head feature 120 on scroll this will tell you if any commits are in one but not the other and will give you a list of any nonshared between the branches another option is to do this sh master git log master feature 120 on scroll no merges possible issues with interactive rebases the rebase editing screen says noop if youre seeing this noop that means you are trying to rebase against a branch that is at an identical commit or is ahead of your current branch you can try making sure your master branch is where it should be rebase against head 2 or earlier instead there were conflicts if you are unable to successfully complete the rebase you may have to resolve conflicts first run git status to see which files have conflicts in them sh my branch git status on branch my branch changes not staged for commit use git add to update what will be committed use git checkout to discard changes in working directory both modified readme md in this example readme md has conflicts open that file and look for the following vim head some code some code new commit you will need to resolve the differences between the code that was added in your new commit in the example everything from the middle line to new commit and your head if you want to keep one branchs version of the code you can use ours or theirs sh master git checkout ours readme md when merging use ours to keep changes from the local branch or theirs to keep changes from the other branch when rebasing use theirs to keep changes from the local branch or ours to keep changes from the other branch for an explanation of this swap see this note in the git documentation if the merges are more complicated you can use a visual diff editor sh master git mergetool t opendiff after you have resolved all conflicts and tested your code git add the files you have changed and then continue the rebase with git rebase continue sh my branch git add readme md my branch git rebase continue if after resolving all the conflicts you end up with an identical tree to what it was before the commit you need to git rebase skip instead if at any time you want to stop the entire rebase and go back to the original state of your branch you can do so sh my branch git rebase abort stash stash all edits to stash all the edits in your working directory sh git stash if you also want to stash untracked files use u option sh git stash u stash specific files to stash only one file from your working directory sh git stash push working directory path filename ext to stash multiple files from your working directory sh git stash push working directory path filename1 ext working directory path filename2 ext stash with message sh git stash save message apply a specific stash from list first check your list of stashes with message using sh git stash list then apply a specific stash from the list using sh git stash apply stash n here n indicates the position of the stash in the stack the topmost stash will be position 0 finding i want to find a string in any commit to find a certain string which was introduced in any commit you can use the following structure sh git log s string to find commons parameters source means to show the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached all means to start from every branch reverse prints in reverse order it means that will show the first commit that made the change i want to find by author committer to find all commits by author committer you can use sh git log author name or email git log committer name or email keep in mind that author and committer are not the same the author is the person who originally wrote the code on the other hand the committer is the person who committed the code on behalf of the original author i want to list commits containing specific files to find all commits containing a specific file you can use sh git log path to file you would usually specify an exact path but you may also use wild cards in the path and file name sh git log js while using wildcards its useful to inform name status to see the list of committed files sh git log name status js find a tag where a commit is referenced to find all tags containing a specific commit sh git tag contains commitid submodules clone all submodules sh git clone recursive git github com foo bar git if already cloned sh git submodule update init recursive remove a submodule creating a submodule is pretty straight forward but deleting them less so the commands you need are sh git submodule deinit submodulename git rm submodulename git rm cached submodulename rm rf git modules submodulename miscellaneous objects restore a deleted file first find the commit when the file last existed sh git rev list n 1 head filename then checkout that file git checkout deletingcommitid filename delete tag sh git tag d tag name git push remote refs tags tag name recover a deleted tag if you want to recover a tag that was already deleted you can do so by following these steps first you need to find the unreachable tag sh git fsck unreachable grep tag make a note of the tags hash then restore the deleted tag with following making use of git update ref sh git update ref refs tags tag name hash your tag should now have been restored deleted patch if someone has sent you a pull request on github but then deleted their original fork you will be unable to clone their repository or to use git am as the diff patch urls become unavailable but you can checkout the pr itself using githubs special refs to fetch the content of pr 1 into a new branch called pr 1 sh git fetch origin refs pull 1 head pr 1 from github com foo bar new ref refs pull 1 head pr 1 exporting a repository as a zip file sh git archive format zip output full path to zipfile zip master tracking files i want to change a file names capitalization without changing the contents of the

fetch p i want to add an empty directory to my repository you cant git doesnt support this but theres a hack you can create a gitignore file in the directory with the following contents ignore everything in this directory except this file gitignore another common convention is to make an empty file in the folder titled gitkeep sh mkdir mydir touch mydir gitkeep you can also name the file as just keep in which case the second line above would be touch mydir keep i want to cache a username and password for a repository you might have a repository that requires authentication in which case you can cache a username and password so you dont have to enter it on every push pull credential helper can do this for you sh git config global credential helper cache set git to use the credential memory cache sh git config global credential helper cache timeout 3600 set the cache to timeout after 1 hour setting is in seconds i want to make git ignore permissions and filemode changes sh git config core filemode false if you want to make this the default behaviour for logged in users then use sh git config global core filemode false i want to set a global user to configure user

for easy reviewing sh git config global color ui auto ive no idea what i did wrong so youre screwed you reset something or you merged the wrong branch or you force pushed and now you cant find your commits you know at some point you were doing alright and you want to go back to some state you were at this is what git reflog is for reflog keeps track of any changes to the tip of a branch even if that tip isnt referenced by a branch or a tag basically every time head changes a new entry is added to the reflog this only works for local repositories sadly and it only tracks movements not changes to a file that werent recorded anywhere for instance sh master git reflog 0a2e358 head 0 reset moving to head 2 0254ea7 head 1 checkout moving from 2 2 to master c10f740 head 2 checkout moving from master to 2 2 the reflog above shows a checkout from master to the 2 2 branch and back from there theres a hard reset to an older commit the latest activity is represented at the top labeled head 0 if it turns out that you accidentally moved back the reflog will contain the commit master pointed to 0254ea7 before you accidentally dropped 2 commits sh git reset hard 0254ea7 using git reset it is then possible to change master back to the commit it was before this provides a safety net in case history was accidentally changed copied and edited from source other resources books pro git scott
