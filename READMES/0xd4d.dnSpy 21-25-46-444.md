dnspy dnspy is a debugger and net assembly editor you can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you dont have any source code available want to say thanks click the star at the top of the page or fork dnspy and send a pr the following pictures show dnspy in action it shows dnspy editing and debugging a net exe file not source code features see below for more detail debug net framework net core and unity game assemblies no source code required edit assemblies in c or visual basic or il and edit all metadata light and dark themes extensible write your own extension high dpi support per monitor dpi aware and much more see below dnspy uses the ilspy decompiler engine and the roslyn c visual basic compiler and many other open source libraries see below for more info binaries latest release latest build or build it from source see the wiki debugger debug net framework net core and unity game assemblies no source code required set breakpoints and step into any assembly locals watch autos windows variables windows supports saving variables eg decrypted byte arrays to disk or view them in the hex editor memory window object ids multiple processes can be debugged at the same time break on module load tracepoints and conditional breakpoints export import breakpoints and tracepoints call stack threads modules processes windows break on thrown exceptions 1st chance variables windows support evaluating c visual basic expressions dynamic modules can be debugged but not dynamic methods due to clr limitations output window logs various debugging events and it shows timestamps by default assemblies that decrypt themselves at runtime can be debugged dnspy will use the in memory image you can also force dnspy to always use in memory images instead of disk files public api you can write an extension or use the c interactive window to control the debugger assembly editor all metadata can be edited edit methods and classes in c or visual basic with intellisense no source code required add new methods classes or members in c or visual basic il editor for low level il method body editing low level metadata tables can be edited this uses the hex editor internally hex editor click on an address in the decompiled code to go to its il code in the hex editor reverse of above press f12 in an il body in the hex editor to go to the decompiled code or other high level representation of the bits its great to find out which statement a patch modified highlights net metadata structures and pe structures tooltips shows more info about the selected net metadata pe field go to position file rva go to net metadata token method body blob strings us heap offset or guid heap index follow references ctrl f12 other baml decompiler blue light and dark themes and a dark high contrast theme bookmarks c interactive window can be used to script dnspy search assemblies for classes methods strings etc analyze class and method usage find callers etc multiple tabs and tab groups references are highlighted use tab shift tab to move to next reference go to entry point and module initializer commands go to metadata token or metadata row commands code tooltips c and visual basic export to project list of other open source libraries used by dnspy ilspy decompiler engine c and visual basic decompilers roslyn c and visual basic compilers dnlib net metadata reader writer which can also read obfuscated assemblies vs mef faster mef equals faster startup clrmd access to lower level debugging info not provided by the cordebug api translating dnspy click here if you want to help with translating dnspy to your native language wiki see the wiki for build instructions and other documentation license dnspy is licensed under gplv3 credits
