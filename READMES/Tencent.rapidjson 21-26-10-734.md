a fast json parser generator for c with both sax dom style api tencent is pleased to support the open source community by making rapidjson available copyright c 2015 thl a29 limited a tencent company and milo yip all rights reserved rapidjson github rapidjson documentation english 简体中文 gitbook with downloadable pdf epub mobi without api reference build status linux windows coveralls lin badge win badge cov badge introduction rapidjson is a json parser and generator for c it was inspired by rapidxml rapidjson is small but complete it supports both sax and dom style api the sax parser is only a half thousand lines of code rapidjson is fast its performance can be comparable to strlen it also optionally supports sse2 sse4 2 for acceleration rapidjson is self contained and header only it does not depend on external libraries such as boost it even does not depend on stl rapidjson is memory friendly each json value occupies exactly 16 bytes for most 32 64 bit machines excluding text string by default it uses a fast memory allocator and the parser allocates memory compactly during parsing rapidjson is unicode friendly it supports utf 8 utf 16 utf 32 le be and their detection validation and transcoding internally for example you can read a utf 8 file and let rapidjson transcode the json strings into utf 16 in the dom it also supports surrogates and \u0000 null character more features can be read here json javascript object notation is a light weight data exchange format rapidjson should be in full compliance with rfc7159 ecma 404 with optional support of relaxed syntax more information about json can be obtained at introducing json rfc7159 the javascript object notation json data interchange format standard ecma 404 the json data interchange format highlights in v1 1 2016 8 25 added json pointer added json schema added relaxed json syntax comment trailing comma nan infinity iterating array object with c 11 range based for loop reduce memory overhead of each value from 24 bytes to 16 bytes in x86 64 architecture for other changes please refer to change log compatibility rapidjson is cross platform some platform compiler combinations which have been tested are shown as follows visual c 2008 2010 2013 on windows 32 64 bit gnu c 3 8 x on cygwin clang 3 4 on mac os x 32 64 bit and ios clang 3 4 on android ndk users can build and run the unit tests on their platform compiler installation rapidjson is a header only c library just copy the include rapidjson folder to system or projects include path rapidjson uses following software as its dependencies cmake as a general build tool optional doxygen to build documentation optional googletest for unit and performance testing to generate user documentation and run tests please proceed with the steps below execute git submodule update init to get the files of thirdparty submodules google test create directory called build in rapidjson source directory change to build directory and run cmake command to configure your build windows users can do the same with cmake gui application on windows build the solution found in the build directory on linux run make from the build directory on successful build you will find compiled test and example binaries in bin directory the generated documentation will be available in doc html directory of the build tree to run tests after finished build please run make test or ctest from your build tree you can get detailed output using ctest v command it is possible to install library system wide by running make install command from the build tree with administrative privileges this will install all files according to system preferences once rapidjson is installed it is possible to use it from other cmake projects by adding find package rapidjson line to your cmakelists txt usage at a glance this simple example parses a json string into a document dom make a simple modification of the dom and finally stringify the dom to a json

parse a json message with sax api serialize serialize a c object into json with sax api jsonx implements a jsonxwriter which stringify sax events into jsonx a kind of xml format the example is a command line tool which converts input json into jsonx format schema schemavalidator a command line tool to validate a json with a json schema advanced prettyauto a modified version of pretty to automatically handle json with any utf encodings parsebyparts implements an asyncdocumentparser which can parse json in parts using c 11 thread filterkey a command line tool to remove all values with
