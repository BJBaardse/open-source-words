install npm npm install hover css save bower bower install hover save download zip how to use hover css can be used in a number of ways either copy and paste the effect youd like to use in your own stylesheet or reference the stylesheet then just add the class name of the effect to the element youd like it applied to a copy and paste an effect if you plan on only using one or several effects its better practice to copy and paste an effect into your own stylesheet so a user doesnt have to download css hover css in its entirety assuming you want to use the grow effect download hover css in css hover css find the grow css each effect is named using a comment above it css grow hvr grow display inline block vertical align middle transform translatez 0 box shadow 0 0 1px rgba 0 0 0 0 backface visibility hidden moz osx font smoothing grayscale transition duration 0 3s transition property transform hvr grow hover hvr grow focus hvr grow active transform scale 1 1 3 copy this effect and then paste it into your own stylesheet 4 in the html file which youd like the effect to appear add the class of hvr grow to your chosen element example element before applying hover css effect html a href add to basket a example element after applying hover css effect html a href class hvr grow add to basket a note as of 2 0 0 all hover css class names are prefixed with hvr to prevent conflicts with other libraries stylesheets if using sass less this can easily be changed using the namespace namespace variable in scss options scss or less options less b reference hover css if you plan on using many hover css effects you may like to reference the entire hover css stylesheet download hover min css add hover min css to your websites files in a directory named css for example reference hover min css in head of the html page youd like to add hover css effects to html head link href css hover min css rel stylesheet head alternatively you can add a reference into an existing stylesheet like so this may be useful to wordpress users who are unable to edit html css import url hover min css assuming you want to use the grow effect in the html file youd like to use this effect add the class of hvr grow to your chosen element example element before applying hover css effect html a href class button add to basket a example element after applying hover css effect html a href class button hvr grow add to basket a a note on the display property to make an element transformable hover css gives the following to all elements it is applied to css display inline block vertical align middle should you wish to override this behavior either remove the above css from hover css or change the display property for the element be sure to declare the override after the hover css declarations so the css cascade will take effect alternatively if you are using the sass less version of hover css you can remove comment out the forceblocklevel mixin found in scss hacks scss or less hacks less for more information about transformable elements see the css transforms module using icon effects to add a hover css icon place the icon html inside the element that a hover css effect is applied to for example a href class hvr icon forward icon forward i class fa fa chevron circle right hvr icon i a in the above code we have given a link element a class of hvr icon forward which will make an icon move forward when the link is hovered over the icon itself is given a class of hvr icon to let hover css know that this is the icon we want to animate in this example our icon is from fontawesome which weve loaded into the head head of our web page as per fontawesomes instructions like so html link href maxcdn bootstrapcdn com font awesome 4 2 0 css font awesome min css rel stylesheet media all note as of hover css v2 3 0 you can use any method you like for adding icons previously only fontawesome was supported out of the box for example you could use another icon library or instead use an image like so a href class hvr icon spin icon spin img src myicon svg class hvr icon a here the image will act as the icon because it has the hvr icon class applied to it and when hovered over the icon will spin as defined by the hvr icon spin class on the parent element position of the icon is entirely in your control you could place it before the text like so a href class hvr icon spin img src myicon svg class hvr icon icon spin a or use custom css to position the icon as you see fit whats included the project consists of the following folders and files css demo page css contains styles

less flavours other other files of note include index html demonstrates all hover css effects gruntfile js used for development of hover css via grunt browser support many hover css effects rely on css3 features such as transitions animations transforms and pseudo elements for that reason effects may not fully work in older browsers transitions and animations not supported below internet explorer 10 transforms not supported below internet explorer 9 generated content pseudo elements not supported below internet explorer 8 aside from the above mentioned browsers hover css is supported across all major browsers please see caniuse com for full support for many web technologies and test your webpages accordingly it is recommended to apply fallback effects for older browsers using css supported by those browsers or a feature testing library such as modernizr using grunt for development grunt is non essential but can speed up development with grunt installed run grunt from the command line to set up a development server accessed at http 127 0 0 1 8000 or your local ip for network testing with grunt running sass or less will be preprocessed depending on whether you work out of the scss or less folder and css files will be minified note originally grunt was set up to autoprefix css properties but to make the project as accessible as possible this is no longer the case the prefixed property value sass less mixin should be used for browser prefixing instead see using sass less for development and using less for development using sass less for development sass less are non essential but can speed up development preprocess sass less with your favourite software or the environment provided via grunt sass less is used in the hover css project to separate various css into specific files each effect is within its own file in the effects directory hover css also uses the following scss and less files hacks contains hacks undesirable but usually necessary lines of code applied to certain effects hacks explained here mixins contains prefixed and keyframes mixins that apply the necessary prefixes you specify in options scss options less to properties and keyframes properties can be prefixed like so sass css include prefixed transition duration 3s less css prefixed transition duration 3s the prefixed mixin is passed the property you want to prefix followed by its value keyframes can be prefixed like so sass css include keyframes my animation to color red the keyframes mixin is passed the keyframe name followed by the content using the content directive less css keyframes my animation to color red the keyframes mixin is passed the keyframe name followed by the content both as arguments options contains default options various effect options and the browser prefixes youd like to use with the prefixed mixin by default only the webkit prefix is set to true due to most browsers not requiring prefixes now as of 2 0 0 options also includes a namespace namespace option which allows you to change the name all classes are prefixed with the default namespace is hvr the includeclasses includeclasses option by default is set to true and will generate all hover css effects under their own class names hvr grow for example should you wish to add the properties that make up hover css effects to your own class names set this option to false
