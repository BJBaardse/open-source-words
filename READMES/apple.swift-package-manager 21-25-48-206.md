swift package manager project the swift package manager is a tool for managing distribution of source code aimed at making it easy to share your code and reuse others code the tool directly addresses the challenges of compiling and linking swift packages managing dependencies versioning and supporting flexible distribution and collaboration models weve designed the system to make it easy to share packages on services like github but packages are also great for private personal development sharing code within a team or at any other granularity note that at this time the package manager has no support for ios watchos or tvos platforms table of contents getting started documentation system requirements installation managing swift environments choosing a swift version support contributions license getting started please use this guide for learning package manager basics documentation for quick help use the swift package help command for extensive documentation on using swift package manager creating packages and more see documentation for additional documentation on developing the swift package manager itself see documentation development system requirements the package managers system requirements are the same as those for swift with the caveat that the package manager requires git at runtime as well as build time installation the swift package manager is included in xcode 8 0 and all subsequent releases the package manager is also available for other platforms as part of all snapshots available at swift org including snapshots for the latest versions built from master for installation instructions for downloaded snapshots please see the getting started section of swift org you can verify your installation by typing swift package version in a terminal sh swift package version apple swift package manager managing swift environments on macos usr bin swift is just a stub that forwards invocations to the active toolchain thus when you call swift build it will use the swift defined by your toolchains environment variable this can be used to easily switch between the default tools and a development snapshot sh xcrun find swift applications xcode app contents developer toolchains xcodedefault xctoolchain usr bin swift swift version apple swift version 3 0 export toolchains swift xcrun find swift library developer toolchains swift latest xctoolchain usr bin swift swift version swift version 3 0 dev to use a specific toolchain you can set toolchains to the cfbundleidentifier in an xctoolchains info plist choosing a swift version the swift exec environment variable specifies the swiftc executable path used by swift package if it is not set the package manager will try to locate it in swift packages parent directory on macos by calling xcrun find swiftc by searching the path support if you have any trouble with the package manager help is available we recommend the swift forums our bug tracker when adding a bug to the tracker you should follow the bug reporting guidelines they can be found in resources md if youre not comfortable sharing your question with the list contact details for the code owners can be found in code owners txt however the mailing list is usually the best place to go for help contributions to learn about the policies and best practices that govern contributions to the swift project please read the contributor guide if you are interested in contributing please read the community proposal which provides some context for decisions made in the current implementation and offers direction for the development of future features instructions for setting up the development environment are available here the swift package manager uses llbuild as the underlying build system for compiling source files it is also open source and part of the swift project license copyright 2015 2018 apple inc and the swift project authors licensed under apache license v2 0 with runtime library exception see https swift org license txt for license information see https swift org contributors txt for swift project authors
