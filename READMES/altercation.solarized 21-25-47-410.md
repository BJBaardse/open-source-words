title solarized description precision colors for machines and people author ethan schoonover tags test testing test123 colors light yellow created 2011 mar 15 modified 2011 apr 16 solarized precision colors for machines and people solarized is a sixteen color palette eight monotones eight accent colors designed for use with terminal and gui applications it has several unique properties i designed this colorscheme with both precise cielab lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships it has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays as well as uncalibrated intentionally miscalibrated displays and in a variety of lighting conditions see the changelog for whats new in the most recent release currently available in formats for cf screenshots below editors ides vim by me the vim only portion of solarized is available here for use with pathogen etc see also the vim readme emacs courtesy of greg pfeil sellout in

are all kept in sync so you can pull any of them and get the most up to date version features selective contrast on a sunny summer day i love to read a book outside not right in the sun thats too bright ill hunt for a shady spot under a tree the shaded paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely if you were to actually measure the contrast between the two youd find it is much lower than black text on a white background or white on black on your display device of choice black text on white from a computer display is akin to reading a book in direct sunlight and tires the eye solarized reduces brightness contrast but unlike many low contrast colorschemes retains contrasting hues based on colorwheel relations for syntax highlighting readability both sides of the force i often switch between dark and light modes when editing text and code solarized retains the same selective contrast relationships and overall feel when switching between the light and dark background modes a lot of thought planning and testing has gone into making both modes feel like part of a unified colorscheme 16 5 palette modes solarized works as a sixteen color palette for compatibility with common terminal based applications emulators in addition it has been carefully designed to scale down to a variety of five color palettes four base monotones plus one accent color for use in design work such as web design in every case it retains a strong personality but doesnt overwhelm precision symmetry the monotones have symmetric cielab lightness differences so switching from dark to light mode retains the same perceived contrast in brightness between each value each mode is equally readable the accent colors are based off specific colorwheel relations and subsequently translated to cielab to ensure perceptual uniformity in terms of lightness the hues themselves as with the monotone a b values have been adjusted within a small range to achieve the most pleasing combination of colors see also the usage development section below for details on the specific values to be used in different contexts this makes colorscheme inversion trivial here for instance is a sass scss snippet that inverts solarized based on the class of the html tag e g html class dark red to give a dark background with red accent base03 002b36 base02 073642 base01 586e75 base00 657b83 base0 839496 base1 93a1a1

developer notes for information about optional repository structure and readme formats solarized flips between light and dark modes in each mode four monotones form the core values with an optional fifth for emphasized content thus in the case of a dark background colorscheme the normal relationship for background and body text is base03 base0 please note that body text is not base00 note also that in cases where the background and foreground can be specified as a pair value text can be highlighted using a combination of base02 base1 the l a b lightness difference between base03 base0 and base02 base1 is identical by design resulting in identical readability against both normal and highlighted backgrounds an example use case is folded text in vim which uses base02 for the background and base1 for the foreground the values in this example are simply inverted in the case of a light background
