alamofire focused specifically on core networking implementations additional component libraries have been created by the alamofire software foundation to bring additional functionality to the alamofire ecosystem alamofireimage an image library including image response serializers uiimage and uiimageview extensions custom image filters an auto purging in memory cache and a priority based image downloading system alamofirenetworkactivityindicator controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on ios using alamofire it contains configurable delay timers to help mitigate flicker and can support urlsession instances not managed by alamofire requirements ios 8 0 macos 10 10 tvos 9 0 watchos 2 0 xcode 8 3 swift 3 1 migration guides alamofire 4 0 migration guide alamofire

the following command bash gem install cocoapods cocoapods 1 1 is required to build alamofire 4 0 to integrate alamofire into your xcode project using cocoapods specify it in your podfile ruby source https github com cocoapods specs git platform ios 10 0 use frameworks target do pod alamofire 4 7 end then run the following command bash pod install carthage carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks you can install carthage with homebrew using the following command bash brew update brew install carthage to integrate alamofire into your xcode project using carthage specify it in your cartfile ogdl github alamofire alamofire 4 7 run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built alamofire framework into your xcode project swift package manager the swift package manager is a tool for automating the distribution of swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler it is in early development but alamofire does support its use on supported platforms once you have your swift package set up adding alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your package swift swift 3 swift dependencies package url https github com alamofire alamofire git majorversion 4 swift 4 swift dependencies package url https github com alamofire alamofire git from 4 0 0 manually if you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers you can integrate alamofire into your project manually embedded framework open up terminal cd into your top level project directory and run the following command if your project is not initialized as a git repository bash git init add alamofire as a git submodule by running the following command bash git submodule add https github com alamofire alamofire git open the new alamofire folder and drag the alamofire xcodeproj into the project navigator of your applications xcode project it should appear nested underneath your applications blue project icon whether it is above or below all the other xcode groups does not matter select the alamofire xcodeproj in the project navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target next select your application project in the project navigator blue project icon to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the targets heading in the sidebar in the tab bar at the top of that window open the general panel click on the button under the embedded binaries section you will see two different alamofire xcodeproj folders each with two different versions of the alamofire framework nested inside a products folder it does not matter which products folder you choose from but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom alamofire framework select the top alamofire framework for ios and the bottom one for os x you can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project the build target for alamofire will be listed as either alamofire ios alamofire macos alamofire tvos or alamofire watchos and thats it the alamofire framework is automagically added as a target dependency linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device open radars the following radars have some effect on the current implementation of alamofire rdar 21349340 compiler throwing warning due to toll free bridging issue in test case rdar 26870455 background url session configurations do not work in the simulator rdar 26849668 some urlprotocol apis do not properly handle urlrequest rdar 36082113 urlsessiontaskmetrics failing to link on watchos 3 0 resolved radars the following radars have been resolved over time after being filed against the alamofire project rdar 26761490 swift string interpolation causing memory leak with common usage resolved on 9 1 17 in xcode 9 beta 6 faq whats the origin of the name alamofire alamofire is named after the alamo fire flower a hybrid variant of the bluebonnet the official state flower of texas what logic belongs in a router vs a request adapter simple static data such as paths parameters and common headers belong in the router dynamic data such as an authorization header whose value can changed based on an authentication system belongs in a requestadapter the reason the dynamic data must be placed into the requestadapter is to support retry operations when a request is retried the original request is not rebuilt meaning the router will not be called again the requestadapter is called again allowing the dynamic data to be updated on the original request before retrying the request credits alamofire is owned and maintained by the alamofire software foundation you can follow them on twitter at alamofiresf for project updates and releases security disclosure if you believe you have identified a security vulnerability with alamofire you should report it as soon as possible via email to security alamofire org please do not post it to a public issue tracker donations the asf is looking to raise money to officially stay registered as a federal non profit organization registering will allow us members to gain some legal protections and also allow us to put donations to use tax free donating to the asf will enable us to pay our yearly legal fees to keep the non profit in good status pay for our mail servers to help us stay on top of all questions and security issues potentially fund test servers to make it easier for us to test the edge cases potentially fund developers to work on one of our projects full time the community adoption of the asf libraries has been amazing we are greatly humbled by your enthusiasm around the projects and want to continue to do everything we can to move the needle forward with your continued support the asf will be able to improve its reach and also provide better legal safety for the core members if you use any of our libraries for work see if your employers would be interested in donating any amount you can donate today to help us reach our goal would be greatly appreciated license alamofire is released under the mit license see license for details
