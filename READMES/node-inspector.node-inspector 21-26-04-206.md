node inspector overview node inspector is a debugger interface for node js applications that uses the blink developer tools formerly webkit web inspector since version 6 3 node js provides a built in devtools based debugger which mostly deprecates node inspector see e g this blog post to get started the built in debugger is developed directly by the v8 chromium team and provides certain advanced features e g long async stack traces that are too difficult to implement in node inspector table of content quick start features known issues troubleshooting advanced use configuration contributing credits quick start install sh npm install g node inspector start sh node debug app js where app js is the name of your main node application javascript file see available configuration options here debug the node debug command will load node inspector in your default browser note node inspector works in chrome and opera only you have to re open the inspector page in one of those browsers if another browser is your default web browser e g safari or internet explorer node inspector works almost exactly as the chrome developer tools read the excellent devtools overview to get started other useful resources documentation specific to node inspector provided by strongloop debugging with node inspector miroslavs talk how to debug node apps with node inspector dannys screencasts most likely outdated by now getting started from scratch on wiki most likely outdated by now features the blink devtools debugger is a powerful javascript debugger interface node inspector supports almost all of the debugging features of devtools including navigate in your source files set breakpoints and specify trigger conditions step over step in step out resume continue inspect scopes variables object properties hover your mouse over an expression in your source to display its value in a tooltip edit variables and object properties continue to location break on exceptions disable enable all breakpoints cpu and heap profiling network client requests inspection console output inspection cool stuff node inspector uses websockets so no polling for breaks remote debugging and debugging remote machine live edit of running code optionally persisting changes back to the file system set breakpoints in files that are not loaded into v8 yet useful for debugging module loading initialization embeddable in other applications see embedding howto for more details known issues be careful about viewing the contents of buffer objects each byte is displayed as an individual array element for most buffers this will take too long to render while not stopped at a breakpoint the console doesnt always behave as you might expect see the issue 146 break on uncaught exceptions does not work in all node versions you need at least v0 11 3 see node 5713 debugging multiple processes e g cluster is cumbersome read the following blog post for instructions debugging clustered apps with node inspector troubleshooting my script runs too fast to attach the debugger the debugged process must be started with debug brk this way the script is paused on the first line note node debug adds this option for you by default i got the ui in a weird state when in doubt refresh the page in browser can i debug remotely yes node inspector must be running on the same machine but your browser can be anywhere just make sure port 8080 is accessible and if node inspector is not running on your remote machine you can also debug it as long as your local machine can connect it in this way you must launch node inspector with no inject which means some features are not supported such as profiling and consoling output inspection so how to debug remote machine with your local node inspector option 1 node inspector debug host 192 168 0 2 no inject then open the url http 127 0 0 1 8080 debug port 5858 option 2 node inspector no inject then specify the remote machine address as a host parameter in the url e g http 127 0 0 1 8080 debug host 192 168 123 12 port 5858 how do i specify files to hide create a json encoded array you must escape quote characters when using a command line option sh node inspector hidden node modules framework note that the array items are interpreted as regular expressions ui doesnt load or doesnt work and refresh didnt help make sure that you have adblock disabled as well as any other content blocking scripts and plugins how can i selectively delete debug session metadata you may want to delete debug session metadata if for example node inspector gets in a bad state with some watch variables that were function calls possibly into some special c bindings in such cases even restarting the application debug session may not fix the problem node inspector stores debug session metadata in the html5 local storage you can inspect the contents of local storage and remove any items as needed in google chrome you can execute any of the following in the javascript console js remove all window localstorage clear or to list keys so you can selectively remove them with removeitem window localstorage remove all the watch expressions window localstorage removeitem watchexpressions remove all the breakpoints window localstorage removeitem breakpoints when you are done cleaning up hit refresh in the browser node inspector takes a long time to start up try setting no preload to true this option disables searching disk for js at startup code will still be loaded into node inspector at runtime as modules are required how do i debug mocha unit tests you have to start mocha as the debugged process and make sure the execution pauses on the first line this way you have enough time to set your breakpoints before the tests are run sh node debug mocha how do i debug gulp tasks if you are running on a unix system you can simply run the following command the which statement gets replaced with the full path to the gulp cli sh node debug which gulp task if you are running on windows you have to get the full path of gulp js to make an equivalent command sh node debug appdata \npm\node modules\gulp\bin\gulp js task you can omit thetaskpart to run thedefault task advanced use while running node debug is a convenient way to start your debugging session there may come time when you need to tweak the default setup there are three steps needed to get you up and debugging 1 start the node inspector server sh node inspector you can leave the server running in background its possible to debug multiple processes using the same server instance 2 enable debug mode in your node process you can either start node with a debug flag like sh node debug your node program js or to pause your script on the first line sh node debug brk your short node script js or you can enable debugging on a node that is already running by sending it a signal get the pid of the node process using your favorite method pgrep or ps ef are good sh pgrep l node 2345 node your node server js send it the usr1 signal sh kill s usr1 2345 windows windows does not support unix signals to enable debugging you can use an undocumented api function process debugprocess pid get the pid of the node process using your favorite method e g sh tasklist fi imagename eq node exe image name pid session name session mem usage node exe 3084 console 1 11 964 k call the api sh node e process debugprocess 3084 3 load the debugger ui open http 127 0 0 1 8080 port 5858 in the chrome browser configuration both node inspector and node debug use rc module to manage configuration options places for configuration command line arguments parsed by yargs environment variables prefixed with node inspector if you passed an option config file then from that file a local node inspectorrc or the first found looking in etc home node inspectorrc home node inspector config home config node inspector home config node inspector config etc node inspectorrc etc node inspector config all
