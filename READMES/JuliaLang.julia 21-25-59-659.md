official freebsd 11 0 x86 64 64 bit ✓ community all systems marked with ✓ for ci are tested using continuous integration for every commit systems with ✓ for binaries have official binaries available on the downloads page and are tested regularly the ptx backend needs a source build and the cudanative jl package the systems listed here with neither ci nor official binaries are known to build and work but ongoing support for those platforms is dependent on community efforts it is possible that julia will build and work on other platforms too and were always looking to better our platform coverage if youre using julia on a platform not listed here let us know source download and compilation first make sure you have all the required dependencies installed then acquire the source code by cloning the git repository git clone git github com julialang julia git if you are behind a firewall you may need to use the https protocol instead of the git protocol git config global url https insteadof git be sure to also configure your system to use the appropriate proxy settings e g by setting the https proxy and http proxy variables by default you will be building the latest unstable version of julia however most users should use the most recent stable version of julia which is currently the 0 6 series of releases you can get this version by changing to the julia directory and running git checkout v0 6 4 now run make to build the julia executable to perform a parallel build use make j n and supply the maximum number of concurrent processes see platform specific build notes for details when compiled the first time it will automatically download and build its external dependencies this takes a while but only has to be done once if the defaults in the build do not work for you and you need to set specific make parameters you can save them in make user and place the file in the root of your julia source the build will automatically check for the existence of make user and use it if it exists building julia requires 5gib of disk space and approximately 2gib of virtual memory for builds of julia starting with 0 5 0 dev you can create out of tree builds of julia by specifying make o build directory configure on the command line this will create a directory mirror with all of the necessary makefiles to build julia in the specified directory these builds will share the source files in julia and deps srccache each out of tree build directory can have its own make user file to override the global make user file in the top level folder if you need to build julia on a machine without internet access use make c deps getall to download all the necessary files then copy the julia directory over to the target environment and build with make note the build process will fail badly if any of the build directorys parent directories have spaces or other shell meta characters such as or in their names this is due to a limitation in gnu make once it is built you can run the julia executable after you enter your julia directory and run julia to run julia from anywhere you can add an alias in bash echo alias julia path to install folder bin julia bashrc source bashrc or add a soft link to the julia executable in the julia directory to usr local bin or any suitable directory already in your path or add the julia directory to your executable path for this shell session in bash export path pwd path in csh or tcsh set path path cwd or add the julia directory to your executable path permanently e g in bash profile or write prefix path to install folder into make user and then run make install if there is a version of julia already installed in this folder you should delete it before running make install now you should be able to run julia like this julia if everything works correctly you will see a julia banner and an interactive prompt into which you can enter expressions for evaluation errors related to libraries might be caused by old incompatible libraries sitting around in your path in this case try moving the julia directory earlier in the path note that most of the instructions above apply to unix systems your first test of julia determines whether your build is working properly from the unix windows command prompt inside the julia source directory type make testall you should see output that lists a series of running tests if they complete without error you should be in good shape to start using julia you can read about getting started in the manual if you are building a julia package for distribution on linux os x or windows take a look at the detailed notes in distributing md updating an existing source tree if you have previously downloaded julia using git clone you can update the existing source tree using git pull rather than starting anew cd julia git pull make assuming that you had made no changes to the source tree that will conflict with upstream updates these commands will trigger a build to update to the latest version general troubleshooting over time the base library may accumulate enough changes such that the bootstrapping process in building the system image will fail if this happens the build may fail with an error like sh this error is usually fixed by running make clean if the error persists try make cleanall as described running make clean make is usually sufficient occasionally the stronger cleanup done by make cleanall is needed new versions of external dependencies may be introduced which may occasionally cause conflicts with existing builds of older versions a special make targets exist to help wipe the existing build of a dependency for example make c deps clean llvm will clean out the existing build of llvm so that llvm will be rebuilt from the downloaded source distribution the next time make is called make c deps distclean llvm is a stronger wipe which will also delete the downloaded source distribution ensuring that a fresh copy of the source distribution will be downloaded and that any new patches will be applied the next time make is called b to delete existing binaries of julia and all its dependencies delete the usr directory in the source tree if youve updated os x recently be sure to run xcode select install to update the command line tools otherwise you could run into errors for missing headers and libraries such as ld library not found for lcrt1 10 6 o if youve moved the source directory you might get errors such as cmake error the current cmakecache txt directory is different than the directory where cmakecache txt was created in which case you may delete the offending dependency under deps in extreme cases you may wish to reset the source tree to a pristine state the following git commands may be helpful sh git reset hard forcibly remove any changes to any files under version control git clean x f d forcibly remove any file or directory not under version control to avoid losing work make sure you know what these commands do before you run them git will not be able to undo these changes uninstalling julia julia does not install anything outside the directory it was cloned into julia can be completely uninstalled by deleting this directory julia packages are installed in julia by default and can be uninstalled by deleting julia platform specific build notes linux general gcc version 4 7 or later is required to build julia to use external shared libraries not in the system library search path set use system xxx 1 and ldflags wl rpath path to dir contains libxxx so in make user instead of setting ldflags putting the library directory into the environment variable ld library path at both compile and run time also works the use system flags should be used with caution these are meant only for troubleshooting porting and packaging where package maintainers work closely with the julia developers to make sure that julia is built correctly production use cases should use the officially provided binaries issues arising from the use of these flags will generally not be accepted see also the external dependencies architecture customization julia can be built for a non generic architecture by configuring the arch makefile variable see the appropriate section of make inc for additional customization options such as march and julia cpu target for example to build for pentium 4 set march pentium4 and install the necessary system libraries for linking on ubuntu these may include lib32gfortran 6 dev lib32gcc1 and lib32stdc 6 among others you can also set march native for a maximum performance build customized for the current machine cpu ubuntu the julia deps ppa contains updated packages for julia dependencies if you want to use system libraries instead of having them downloaded and built during the build process see system provided libraries rhel centos 6 on rhel centos 6 systems the default compiler gcc 4 4 is too old to build julia install or contact your systems administrator to install a more recent version of gcc the scientific linux developer toolset works well linux build troubleshooting problem possible solution openblas build failure set one of the following build options in make user and build again openblas target arch barcelona amd cpus or openblas target arch nehalem intel cpus set openblas dynamic arch 0 to disable compiling multiple architectures in a single binary openblas no avx2 1 disables avx2 instructions allowing openblas to compile with openblas dynamic arch 1 using old versions of binutils use system blas 1 uses the system provided libblas set libblas lopenblas and libblasname libopenblas to force the use of the system provided openblas when multiple blas versions are installed if you get an error that looks like kernel x86 64 dgemm kernel 4x4 haswell s 1709 error no such instruction vpermpd 0xb1 ymm0 ymm0 then you need to set openblas dynamic arch 0 or openblas no avx2 1 or you need a newer version of binutils 2 18 or newer issue 7653 illegal instruction error check if your cpu supports avx while your os does not e g through virtualization as described in this issue os x you need to have the current xcode command line utilities installed run xcode select install in the terminal you will need to rerun this terminal command after each os x update otherwise you may run into errors involving missing libraries or headers you will also need a 64 bit gfortran to compile julia dependencies the gfortran 4 7 and newer compilers in brew fink and macports work for building julia clang is now used by default to build julia on os x 10 7 and above on os x 10 6 the julia build will automatically use gcc on current systems we recommend that you install the command line tools as described above older systems do not have a separate command line tools package from apple and will require a full xcode install on these you will need at least xcode 4 3 3 in xcode prior to v5 0 you can alternatively go to preferences downloads and select the command line utilities these steps will ensure that clang v3 1 is installed which is the minimum version of clang required to build julia if you have set ld library path or dyld library path in your bashrc or equivalent julia may be unable to find various libraries that come bundled with it these environment variables need to be unset for julia to work if you see build failures in openblas or if you prefer to experiment you can use the apple provided blas in veclib by building with use system blas 1 julia does not use the apple provided lapack as it is too old when building julia or its dependencies libraries installed by third party package managers can redirect the compiler to use an incompatible version of the software it is looking for one example of this happening is when a piece of software called the linker gives an error involving undefined symbols if that happens you can usually figure out what software package is causing the error from the names in the error text this sort of error can be bypassed by temporarily uninstalling the offending package if the offending package cannot be uninstalled by itself it may be possible to just uninstall the development headers for example a package ending in dev in fink freebsd clang is the default compiler on freebsd 11 0 release and above the remaining build tools are available from the ports collection and can be installed using pkg install git gcc gmake cmake to build julia simply run gmake note that gmake must be used rather than make since make on freebsd corresponds to the incompatible bsd make rather than gnu make as mentioned above it is important to note that the use system flags should be used with caution on freebsd this is because many system libraries and even libraries from the ports collection link to the systems libgcc s so 1 or to another library which links to the system libgcc s this library declares its gcc version to be 4 6 which is too old to build julia and conflicts with other libraries when linking thus it is highly recommended to simply allow julia to build all of its dependencies if you do choose to use the use system flags note that usr local is not on the compiler path by default so you may need to add ldflags l usr local lib and cppflags i usr local include to your make user though doing so may interfere with other dependencies note that the x86 architecture does not support threading due to lack of compiler runtime library support so you may need to set julia threads 0 in your make user if youre on a 32 bit system windows in order to build julia on windows see readme windows vagrant julia can be developed in an isolated vagrant environment see the vagrant readme for details required build tools and external libraries building julia requires that the following software be installed gnu make — building dependencies gcc g 4 7 or clang 3 1 xcode 4 3 3 on os x — compiling and linking c c libatomic — provided by gcc and needed to support atomic operations python 2 7 — needed to build llvm gfortran — compiling and linking fortran libraries perl — preprocessing of header files of libraries wget curl or fetch freebsd — to automatically download external libraries m4 — needed to build gmp awk — helper tool for makefiles patch — for modifying source code cmake 3 4 3 — needed to build libgit2 pkg config — needed to build libgit2 correctly especially for proxy support on debian based distributions e g ubuntu you can easily install them with apt get sudo apt get install build essential libatomic1 python gfortran perl wget m4 cmake pkg config julia uses the following external libraries which are automatically downloaded or in a few cases included in the julia source repository and then compiled from source the first time you run make llvm 3 9 patches — compiler infrastructure see note below femtolisp — packaged with julia source and used to implement the compiler front end libuv custom fork — portable high performance event based i o library openlibm — portable libm library containing elementary math functions dsfmt — fast mersenne twister pseudorandom number generator library openblas — fast open and maintained basic linear algebra subprograms blas library based on kazushige gotos famous gotoblas see note below lapack 3 5 — library of linear algebra routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations least squares solutions of linear systems of equations eigenvalue problems and singular value problems mkl optional – openblas and lapack may be replaced by intels mkl library suitesparse 4 1 — library of linear algebra routines for sparse matrices see note below pcre 10 00 — perl compatible regular expressions library gmp 5 0 — gnu multiple precision arithmetic library needed for bigint support mpfr 4 0 — gnu multiple precision floating point library needed for arbitrary precision floating point bigfloat support libgit2 0 23 — git linkable library used by julias package manager curl 7 50 — libcurl provides download and proxy support for julias package manager libssh2 1 7 — library for ssh transport used by libgit2 for packages with ssh remotes mbedtls 2 2 — library used for cryptography and transport layer security used by libssh2 utf8proc 2 1 — a library for processing utf 8 encoded unicode strings libosxunwind — clone of libunwind a library that determines the call chain of a program notes for distribution package maintainers we understand that package maintainers will typically want to make use of system libraries where possible please refer to the above version requirements and additional notes below it is strongly advised that package maintainers apply the patches included in the julia repo for llvm and other libraries should they choose to use system versions a list of maintained julia packages for various platforms is available at https julialang org downloads platform html system provided libraries if you already have one or more of these packages installed on your system you can prevent julia from compiling duplicates of these libraries by passing use system 1 to make or adding the line to make user the complete list of possible flags can be found in make inc please be aware that this procedure is not officially supported as it introduces additional variability into the installation and versioning of the dependencies and is recommended only for system package maintainers unexpected compile errors may result as the build system will do no further checking to ensure the proper packages are installed llvm the most complicated dependency is llvm for which we require version 3 9 with some additional patches from upstream llvm is not backward compatible for packaging julia we recommend either bundling a julia only llvm library inside the julia package or adding the patches to the llvm 3 9 package of the distribution a complete list of patches is available in deps llvm mk and the patches themselves are in deps patches the only julia specific patch is the lib renaming llvm symver jlprefix patch which should not be applied to a system llvm the remaining patches are all upstream bug fixes and have been contributed into upstream llvm using an unpatched or different version of llvm will result in errors and or poor performance though julia can be built with newer llvm versions support for this should be regarded as experimental and not suitable for packaging libuv julia uses a custom fork of libuv it is a small dependency and can be safely bundled in the same package as julia and will not conflict with the system library julia builds should not try to use the system libuv blas and lapack as a high performance numerical language julia should be linked to a multi threaded blas and lapack such as openblas or atlas which will provide much better performance than the reference libblas implementations which may be default on some systems intel mkl for a 64 bit architecture the environment should be set up as follows bash source path to intel bin compilervars sh intel64 add the following to the make user file use intel mkl 1 it is highly recommended to start with a fresh clone of the julia repository source code organization the julia source code is organized as follows base source code for the base module part of julias standard library stdlib source code for other standard library packages contrib editor support for julia source miscellaneous scripts deps external dependencies doc src manual source for the user manual doc src stdlib source for standard library function reference src source for julia language core test test suites ui source for various front ends usr binaries and shared libraries loaded by julias standard libraries binary installation if you would rather not compile the latest julia from source platform specific tarballs with pre compiled binaries are also available for download you can either run the julia executable using its full path in the directory created above or add that directory to your executable path so that you can run the julia program from anywhere in the current shell session export path pwd julia path now you should be able to run julia like this julia on windows double click usr bin julia exe if everything works correctly you will see a julia banner and an interactive prompt into which you can enter expressions for evaluation you can read about getting started in the manual note although some system package managers provide julia such installations are neither maintained nor endorsed by the julia project they may be outdated and or unmaintained we recommend you use the official julia binaries instead editor and terminal setup currently julia editing mode support is available for a number of editors while julia modes for emacs sublime text and vim have their own repos others such as textmate notepad and kate are in contrib two major ides are supported for julia juno which is based on atom and julia vscode based on vs code a jupyter notebooks interface is available through ijulia the sublime ijulia plugin enables interaction between ijulia and sublime text in the terminal julia makes great use of both control key and meta key bindings to make the meta key bindings more accessible many terminal emulator programs e g terminal iterm xterm etc allow you to use the alt or option key as meta see the section in the manual on the julia repl for more details
