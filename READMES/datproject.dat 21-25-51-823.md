link with your friend to instantly start downloading files you can also try viewing your files online go to datbase org and enter your link to preview on the top left some users including me when writing this may have trouble connecting to datbase org initially dont be alarmed it is something we are working on thanks bonus http demo dat makes it really easy to share live files on a http server this is a cool demo because we can also see how version history works serve dat files on http with the http option for example dat sync http serves your files to a http website with live reloading and version history this even works for dats youre downloading add the sparse option to only download files you select via http the default http port is 8080 hint use localhost 8080 version 10 to view a specific version get started using dat today with the share and clone commands or read below for more details usage the first time you run a command a dat folder is created to store the dat metadata once a dat is created you can run all the commands inside that folder similar to git dat keeps secret keys in the dat secret keys folder these are required to write to any dats you create sharing the quickest way to get started sharing files is to share ❯ dat share dat 3e830227b4b2be197679ff1b573cc85e689f202c0884eb8bdb0e1fcecbd93119 sharing dat 24 files 383 mb 0 connections download 0 b s upload 0

to decide if a file should be ignored selecting files by default dat will download all files if you want to only download a subset you can create a datdownload file which downloads only the files and folders specified each should be separated by a newline downloading start downloading by running the clone command this creates a folder downloads the content and metadata and a dat folder inside once you started the download you can resume using clone or the other download commands dat clone link dir temp clone a remote dat archive to a local folder this will create a folder with the key name if no folder is specified downloading via dat json key you can use a dat json file to clone also this is useful when combining dat and git for example to clone a dat you can specify the path to a folder containing a dat json git clone git github com joehand dat clone sparse test git dat clone dat clone sparse test this will download the dat specified in the dat json file updating downloaded archives once a dat is clone you can run either dat pull or dat sync in the folder to update the archive dat pull dir update a cloned dat archive with the latest files and exit dat sync dir download latest files and keep connection open to continue updating as remote source is updated shortcut commands dat link dir will run dat clone for new dats or resume the existing dat in dir dat dir is the same as running dat sync dir dat registry and authentication as part of our knight foundation grant we are building a registry for dat archives we will be running a dat registry at datbase org but anyone will be able to create their own once registered you will be able to publish dat archives from our registry anyone can clone archives published to a registry without registration dat clone datbase org jhand cli demo auth experimental you can also use the dat command line to register and publish to dat registries dat plans to support any registry currently datbase org is the only one available and the default to register and login you can use the following commands dat register registry dat login dat whoami once you are logged in to a registry you can publish a dat archive cd my data dat create dat publish name my dataset all registry requests take the registry option if youd like to publish to a different registry than datbase org you can deploy your own compatible registry server if youd rather use your own service key management moving dats dat keys provides a few commands to help you move or backup your dats writing to a dat requires the secret key stored in the dat folder you can export and import these keys between dats first clone your dat to the new location original dat share duplicate dat clone link then transfer the secret key original dat keys export copy the secret key printed out duplicate dat keys import this will prompt you for the secret key paste it in here troubleshooting weve provided some troubleshooting tips based on issues users have seen please open an issue or ask us in our chat room if you need help troubleshooting and it is not covered here if you have trouble sharing downloading in a directory with a dat folder try deleting it and running the

semantic version printed e g 13 1 2 installation issues node npm to use the dat command line tool you will need to have node and npm installed make sure those are installed correctly before installing dat you can check the version of each node v npm v global install the g option installs dat globally allowing you to run it as a command make sure you installed with that option if you receive an eacces error read this guide on fixing npm permissions if you receive an eacces error you may also install dat with sudo sudo npm install g dat have other installation issues let us know you can open an issue or ask us in our chat room debugging output if you are having trouble with a specific command run with the debug environment variable set to dat and optionally also dat node this will help us debug any issues debug dat dat node dat clone dat link dir networking issues networking capabilities vary widely with each computer network and configuration whenever you run dat there are several steps to share or download files with peers discovering peers connecting to peers sending receiving data with successful use dat will show connected to 1 peer after connection if you never see a peer connected your network may be restricting discovery or connection please try using the dat doctor command see below between the two computers not connecting this will help troubleshoot the networks dat may have issues connecting if you are using iptables dat doctor weve included a tool to identify network issues with dat the dat doctor the dat doctor will run two tests attempt to connect to a public server running a dat peer attempt a direct connection between two peers you will need to run the command on both the computers you are trying to share data between start the doctor by running dat doctor for direct connection tests the doctor will print out a command to run on the other computer dat doctor 64 character string the doctor will run through the key steps in the process of sharing data between computers to help identify the issue js api you can use dat in your javascript application js var dat require dat dat data function err dat use dat read more about the js usage provided via dat node for developers please see guidelines on contributing before submitting an issue or pr this command line library uses dat node to create and manage the archives and networking if youd like to build your own dat application that is compatible with this command line tool we suggest using dat node installing from source clone this repository and in a terminal inside of the folder you cloned run this command npm link this should add a dat command line command to your path now you can run the dat command to try it out the contribution guide also has more tips on our development
