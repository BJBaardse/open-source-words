angularjs crud application demo purpose the idea is to demonstrate how to write a typical non trivial crud application using angularjs to showcase angularjs in its most advantageous environment weve set out to write a simplified project management tool supporting teams using the scrum methodology the sample application tries to show best practices when it comes to folders structure using modules testing communicating with a rest back end organizing navigation addressing security concerns authentication authorization this sample application is featured in our book where you can find detailed description of the patterns and techniques used to write this code weve learned a lot while using and supporting angularjs on the mailing list and would like to share our experience stack persistence store mongodb hosted on mongolab backend node js awesome angularjs on the client css based on twitters bootstrap build it is a complete project with a build system focused on angularjs apps and tightly integrated with other tools commonly used in the angularjs community powered by grunt js test written using jasmine syntax test are executed by karma test runner integrated with the grunt js build build supporting js css and angularjs templates minification twitters bootstrap with less templates processing integrated into the build travis ci integration installation platform tools you need to install node js and then the development tools node js comes with a package manager called npm for installing nodejs applications and libraries install node js requires node js version 0 8 4 install grunt cli and karma as global npm modules npm install g grunt cli karma note that you may need to uninstall grunt 0 3 globally before installing grunt cli get the code either clone this repository or fork it on github and clone your fork git clone https github com angular app angular app git cd angular app app server our backend application server is a nodejs application that relies upon some 3rd party npm packages you need to install these install local dependencies from the project root folder cd server npm install cd this will install the dependencies declared in the server package json file client app our client application is a straight html javascript application but our development process uses a node js build tool grunt js grunt relies upon some 3rd party libraries that we need to install as local dependencies using npm install local dependencies from the project root folder cd client npm install cd this will install the dependencies declared in the client package json file building configure server the server stores its data in a mongolab database create an account at mongolab its free https mongolab com signup create a database to use for this application https mongolab com create grab your api key https mongolab com user username your username here edit server config js to set your mongolab api key and the name of the database you created mongo dburl https api mongolab com api 1 the base url of the mongolab db server apikey your api key here our mongolab api key security dbname your db name here the name of database that contains the security information userscollection users the name of the collection contains user information optionally change the name of admin user in server lib initdb js the default is admin admin abc com changeme var initdb adminuser email admin abc com password changeme admin true firstname admin lastname user note the user information including password are stored as plain text in the mongolab database run our initialization script to initialize the database with a first admin user admin abc com changeme node server initdb js configure client the client specifies the name of the mongodb to use in client src app app js if your db is not called ascrum then you need to change the mongolab config constant angular module app constant mongolab config baseurl databases dbname ascrum build the client app the app made up of a number of javascript css and html files that need to be merged into a final distribution for running we use the grunt build tool to do this build client application cd client grunt build cd it is important to build again if you have changed the client configuration as above running start the server run the server cd server node server js cd browse to the application at http localhost 3000 login with the admin user as defined in server lib initdb js browser support we only regularly test against chrome 29 and occasionally against firefox and internet explorer the application should run on most modern browsers that are supported by the angularjs framework obviously if you chose to base your application on this one then you should ensure you do your own testing against browsers that you need to support development folders structure at the top level the repository is split into a client folder and a server folder the client folder contains all the client side angularjs application the server folder contains a very basic express based webserver that delivers and supports the application within the client folder you have the following structure node modules contains build tasks for grunt along with other user installed node packages dist contains build results src contains applications sources test contains test sources configuration and dependencies vendor contains external dependencies for the application default build the default grunt task will build checks the javascript lint runs the unit tests test unit and builds distributable files and run all unit tests grunt or grunt cmd on windows the tests are run by karma and need one or more browsers open to actually run the tests cd client grunt open one or more browsers and point them to http localhost 8080 test once the browsers connect the tests will run and the build will complete if you leave the browsers open at this url then future runs of grunt will automatically run the tests against these browsers continuous building the watch grunt task will monitor the source files and run the default build task every time a file changes grunt watch build without tests if for some reason you dont want to run the test but just generate the files not a good idea you can simply run the build task grunt build building release code you can build a release version of the app with minified files this task will also run the end to end e2e tests the e2e tests require the server to be started and also one or more browsers open to run the tests you can use the same browsers as for the unit tests cd client run grunt release open one or more browsers and point them to http localhost 8080 test once the browsers connect the tests will run and the build will complete if you leave the browsers open at this url then future runs of grunt will automatically run the tests against these browsers continuous testing you can have grunt karma continuously watch for file changes and automatically run all the tests on every change without rebuilding the distribution files this can make the test run faster when you are doing test driven development and dont need to actually run the application itself cd client run grunt test watch open one or more browsers and point them to http localhost 8080 test each time a file changes the tests will be run against each browser
