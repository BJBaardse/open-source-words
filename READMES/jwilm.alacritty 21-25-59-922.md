alacritty alacritty is the fastest terminal emulator in existence using the gpu for rendering enables optimizations that simply arent possible in other emulators alacritty currently supports freebsd linux macos and openbsd windows support is planned before the 1 0 release about alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance the performance goal means it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available the simplicity goal means that it doesnt have features such as tabs or splits which can be better provided by a window manager or terminal multiplexer nor niceties like a gui config editor the software is considered to be at an alpha level of readiness there are missing features and bugs to be fixed but it is already used by many as a daily driver precompiled binaries will eventually be made available on supported platforms this is minimally blocked on a stable config format for now alacritty must be built from source further information announcing alacritty a gpu accelerated terminal emulator january 6 2017 a short talk about alacritty at the rust meetup january 2017 starts at 57 00 installation instructions are provided for macos and many linux variants to compile alacritty from source with the exception of arch which has a package in the aur void linux in main repository and nixos please first read the prerequisites section then find the section for your os and finally go to building and configuration arch linux sh git clone https aur archlinux org alacritty git git cd alacritty git makepkg isr opensuse tumbleweed linux sh zypper in alacritty

alacritty nixpkgs gentoo on gentoo theres a portage overlay available make sure layman is installed and run sh sudo layman a slyfox then add x11 terms alacritty to etc portage package accept keywords and emerge alacritty sh sudo emerge alacritty it might be handy to mask all other packages provided in the slyfox overlay by adding slyfox to etc portage package mask and adding x11 terms alacritty slyfox to etc portage package unmask cargo if you have a rust toolchain setup you can install alacritty via cargo sh cargo install git https github com jwilm alacritty note that you still need to download system build dependencies via your package manager as mentioned above the binary alacritty will be placed into home cargo bin make sure it is in your path default if you use rustup other if you build alacritty on another distribution we would love some help filling in this section of the readme building before you run it install the config file as described below otherwise many things such as arrow keys will not work linux once all the prerequisites are installed compiling alacritty should be easy sh cargo build release if all goes well this should place a binary at target release alacritty desktop entry many linux distributions support desktop entries for adding applications to system menus to install the desktop entry for alacritty run sh sudo cp target release alacritty usr local bin or anywhere else in path sudo desktop file install alacritty desktop sudo update desktop database macos to build an application for macos run sh make app cp r target release osx alacritty app applications manual page installing the manual page requires the additional dependency gzip to install the manual page run sh sudo mkdir p usr local share man man1 gzip c alacritty man sudo tee usr local share man man1 alacritty 1 gz dev null shell completions to get automatic completions for alacrittys flags and arguments you can install the provided shell completions zsh to install the completions for zsh run sudo cp alacritty completions zsh usr share zsh functions completion x alacritty bash to install the completions for bash you can source the alacritty completions bash in your bashrc file if you do not plan to delete the source folder of alacritty you can run sh echo source pwd alacritty completions bash bashrc otherwise you can copy it to the bash completion folder and source it from there sh mkdir p bash completion cp alacritty completions bash bash completion alacritty echo source bash completion alacritty bashrc fish to install the completions for fish run sudo cp alacritty completions fish fish datadir vendor completions d alacritty fish configuration although its possible the default configuration would work on your system youll probably end up wanting to customize it anyhow there is a default alacritty yml and alacritty macos yml at the git repository root for linux and macos respectively alacritty looks for the configuration file at the following paths xdg config home alacritty alacritty yml xdg config home alacritty yml home config alacritty alacritty yml home alacritty yml if none of these paths are found then xdg config home alacritty alacritty yml is created once alacritty is first run on most systems this often defaults to home config alacritty alacritty yml many configuration options will take effect immediately upon saving changes to the config file the only exception is the font and dimensions sections which requires alacritty to be restarted for further explanation of the config file please consult the comments in the default config file issues known unknown feature requests etc if you run into a problem with alacritty please file an issue if youve got a feature request feel free to ask about it keep in mind that alacritty is very much not looking to be a feature rich terminal emulator with all sorts of bells and widgets its primarily a cross platform blazing fast tmux renderer that just works faq is it really the fastest terminal emulator in the terminals ive benchmarked against alacritty is either faster way faster or at least neutral there are no benchmarks in which ive found alacritty to be slower macos tmux vim is slow i thought this was supposed to be fast this appears to be an issue outside of terminal emulators either macos has an ipc performance issue or either tmux or vim or both have a bug this same issue can be seen in iterm2 and terminal app ive found that if tmux is running on another machine which is connected to alacritty via ssh this issue disappears actual throughput and rendering performance are still better in alacritty when will windows support be available when someone has time to work on it contributors would be welcomed my arrow keys dont work it sounds like you deleted some key bindings from your config file please reference the default config file to restore them why doesnt it support scrollback alacrittys original purpose was to provide a better experience when using tmux which already handled scrollback the scope of this project has since expanded and scrollback will eventually be added irc alacritty discussion can be found in alacritty on freenode wayland wayland support is available but not everything works as expected many people have found a better experience using xwayland which can be achieved launching alacritty with the wayland display environment variable cleared sh env wayland display alacritty if youre interested in seeing our wayland support improve please head over to the wayland meta issue on the winit project to see how you
