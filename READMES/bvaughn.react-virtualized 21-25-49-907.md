react components for efficiently rendering large lists and tabular data check out the demo for some examples join the official slack chat at react virtualized now sh sponsors the following wonderful companies have sponsored react virtualized learn more about becoming a sponsor getting started install react virtualized using npm shell npm install react virtualized save es6 commonjs and umd builds are available with each distribution for example js most of react virtualizeds styles are functional eg position size functional styles are applied directly to dom elements the table component ships with a few presentational styles as well they are optional but if you want them you will need to also import the css file this only needs to be done once probably during your applications bootstrapping process import react virtualized styles css you can import any component you want as a named export from react virtualized eg import column table from react virtualized but if you only use a few react virtualized components and youre concerned about increasing your applications bundle size you can directly import only the components you need like so import autosizer from react virtualized dist commonjs autosizer import list from react virtualized dist commonjs list note webpack 4 makes this optimization itself see the documentation if the above syntax looks too cumbersome or you import react virtualized components from a lot of places you can also configure a webpack alias for example js partial webpack config js alias react virtualized list react virtualized dist es list rest then you can just import like so js import list from react virtualized list now you can use you can also use a global friendly umd build html link rel stylesheet href path to react virtualized styles css script src path to react virtualized dist umd react virtualized js script now youre ready to start using the components you can learn more about which components react virtualized has to offer below dependencies react virtualized has very few dependencies and most are managed by npm automatically however the following peer dependencies must be specified by your project in order to avoid version conflicts react react dom npm will not automatically install these for you but it will show you a warning message with instructions on how to install them pure components by default all react virtualized components use shallowcompare to avoid re rendering unless props or state has changed this occasionally confuses users when a collections data changes eg a b c d e f but props do not eg array length the solution to this is to let react virtualized know that something external has changed this can be done a couple of different ways pass thru props the shallowcompare method will detect changes to any props even if they arent declared as proptypes this means you can also pass through additional properties that affect cell rendering to ensure changes are detected for example if youre using list to render a list of items that may be re sorted after initial render react virtualized would not normally detect the sort operation because none of the properties it deals with change however you can pass through the additional sort property to trigger a re render for example js list listprops sortby sortby public methods grid and collection components can be forcefully re rendered using forceupdate for table and list youll need to call forceupdategrid to ensure that the inner grid is also updated for multigrid youll need to call forceupdategrids to ensure that the inner grids are updated documentation api documentation available here there are also a couple of how to guides customizing classes and styles displaying items in reverse order using autosizer creating an infinite loading list natural sort table sorting a table by multiple columns examples examples for each component can be seen in the documentation here are some online demos of each component arrowkeystepper autosizer cellmeasurer collection columnsizer grid infiniteloader list masonry multigrid scrollsync table windowscroller and here are some recipe type demos table with resizable drag and drop columns collapsable tree view full page grid spreadsheet dynamic cell measuring cell hover effects supported browsers react virtualized aims to support all evergreen browsers and recent mobile browsers for ios and android ie 9 is also supported although ie 9 will require some user defined custom css since flexbox layout is not supported if you find a browser specific problem please report it along with a repro case the easiest way to do this is probably by forking this plunker friends here are some great components built on top of react virtualized react infinite calendar infinite scrolling date picker with localization themes keyboard support and more react sortable hoc higher order components to turn any list into an animated touch friendly sortable list react sortable tree drag and drop sortable representation of hierarchical data react virtualized checkbox checkbox group component with virtualization for large number of options react virtualized select drop down menu for react with windowing to support large numbers of options react vtree low level tree component for react with virtualization to support large number of elements react virtualized tree a reactive tree component that aims to render large sets of tree structured data in an elegant and performant way contributions use github issues for requests i
