javascript cookie a simple lightweight javascript api for handling cookies works in all browsers accepts any character heavily tested no dependency unobtrusive json support supports amd commonjs rfc 6265 compliant useful wiki enable custom encoding decoding 900 bytes gzipped if youre viewing this at https github com js cookie js cookie youre reading the documentation for the master branch view documentation for the latest release build status matrix including active pull requests installation direct download download the script here and include it unless you are packaging scripts somehow else html script src path to js cookie js script or include it via jsdelivr cdn html script src https cdn jsdelivr net npm js cookie 2 src js cookie min js script do not include the script directly from github http raw github com the file is being served as text plain and as such being blocked in internet explorer on windows 7 for instance because of the wrong mime type bottom line github is not a cdn package managers javascript cookie supports npm and bower under the name js cookie npm npm install js cookie save module loaders javascript cookie can also be loaded as an amd or commonjs module basic usage create a cookie valid across the entire site javascript cookies set name value create a cookie that expires 7 days from now valid across the entire site javascript cookies set name value expires 7 create an expiring cookie valid to the path of the current page javascript cookies set name value expires 7 path read cookie javascript cookies get name value cookies get nothing undefined read all visible cookies javascript cookies get name value note it is not possible to read a particular cookie by passing one of the cookie attributes which may or may not have been used when writing the cookie in question javascript cookies get foo domain sub example com domain wont have any effect the cookie with the name foo will only be available on get if its visible from where the code is called the domain and or path attribute will not have an effect when reading delete cookie javascript cookies remove name delete a cookie valid to the path of the current page javascript cookies set name value path cookies remove name fail cookies remove name path removed important when deleting a cookie you must pass the exact same path and domain attributes that were used to set the cookie unless youre relying on the default attributes note removing a nonexistent cookie does not raise any exception nor return any value namespace conflicts if there is any danger of a conflict with the namespace cookies the noconflict method will allow you to define a new namespace and preserve the original one this is especially useful when running the script on third party sites e g as part of a widget or sdk javascript assign the js cookie api to a different variable and restore the original window cookies var cookies2 cookies noconflict cookies2 set name value note the noconflict method is not necessary when using amd or commonjs thus it is not exposed in those environments json js cookie provides unobtrusive json storage for cookies when creating a cookie you can pass an array or object literal instead of a string in the value if you do so js cookie will store the string representation of the object according to json stringify javascript cookies set name foo bar when reading a cookie with the default cookies get api you receive the string representation stored in the cookie javascript cookies get name foo bar javascript cookies get name foo bar when reading a cookie with the cookies getjson api you receive the parsed representation of the string stored in the cookie according to json parse javascript cookies getjson name foo bar javascript cookies getjson name foo bar note to support ie6 7 and ie 8 compatibility mode you need to include the json js polyfill https github com douglascrockford json js encoding this project is rfc 6265 compliant all special characters that are not allowed in the cookie name or cookie value are encoded with each ones utf 8 hex equivalent using percent encoding the only character in cookie name or cookie value that is allowed and still encoded is the percent character it is escaped in order to interpret percent input as literal please note that the default encoding decoding strategy is meant to be interoperable only between cookies that are read written by js cookie to override the default encoding decoding strategy you need to use a converter cookie attributes cookie attributes defaults can be set globally by setting properties of the cookies defaults object or individually for each call to cookies set by passing a plain object in the last argument per call attributes override the default attributes expires define when the cookie will be removed value can be a number which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a date instance if omitted the cookie becomes a session cookie to create a cookie that expires in less than a day you can check the faq on the wiki default cookie is removed when the user closes the browser examples javascript cookies set name value expires 365 cookies get name value cookies remove name path a string indicating the path where the cookie is visible default examples javascript cookies set name value path cookies get name value cookies remove name path note regarding internet explorer due to an obscure bug in the underlying wininet internetgetcookie implementation ies document cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename from internet explorer cookie internals faq this means one cannot set a path using window location pathname in case such pathname contains a filename like so check html or at least such cookie cannot be read correctly in fact you should never allow untrusted input to set the cookie attributes or you might be exposed to a xss attack domain a string indicating a valid domain where the cookie should be visible the cookie will also be visible to all subdomains default cookie is visible only to the domain or subdomain of the page where the cookie was created except for internet explorer see below examples assuming a cookie that is being created on site com javascript cookies set name value domain subdomain site com cookies get name undefined need to read at subdomain site com note regarding internet explorer default behavior q3 if i dont specify a domain attribute for a cookie ie sends it to all nested subdomains anyway a yes a cookie set on example com will be sent to sub2 sub1 example com internet explorer differs from other browsers in this regard from internet explorer cookie internals faq this means that if you omit the domain attribute it will be visible for a subdomain in ie secure either true or false indicating if the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol https default no secure protocol requirement examples javascript cookies set name value secure true cookies get name value cookies remove name converters read create a new instance of the api that overrides the default decoding implementation all get methods that rely in a proper decoding to work such as cookies get and cookies get name will run the converter first for each cookie the returning string will be used as the cookie value example from reading one of the cookies that can only be decoded using the escape function javascript document cookie escaped u5317 document cookie default e5 8c 97 var cookies cookies withconverter function value name if name escaped return unescape value cookies get escaped 北 cookies get default 北 cookies get escaped 北 default 北 write create a new instance of the api that overrides the default encoding implementation javascript
