create react app create react apps with no build configuration creating an app – how to create a new app user guide – how to develop apps bootstrapped with create react app create react app works on macos windows and linux if something doesnt work please file an issue quick overview sh npx create react app my app cd my app npm start npx comes with npm 5 2 and higher see instructions for older npm versions then open http localhost 3000 to see your app when youre ready to deploy to production create a minified bundle with npm run build get started immediately you dont need to install or configure tools like webpack or babel they are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code just create a project and youre good to go creating an app youll need to have node 6 on your local development machine but its not required on the server you can use nvm macos linux or nvm windows to easily switch node versions between different projects to create a new app run a single command sh npx create react app my app npx comes with npm 5 2 and higher see instructions for older npm versions it will create a directory called my app inside the current folder inside that directory it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies my app ├── readme md ├── node modules ├── package json ├── gitignore ├── public │ └── favicon ico │ └── index html │ └── manifest json └── src └── app css └── app js └── app test js └── index css └── index js └── logo svg └── registerserviceworker js no configuration or complicated folder structures just the files you need to build your app once the installation is done you can open your project folder sh cd my app inside the newly created project you can run some built in commands npm start or yarn start runs the app in development mode open http localhost 3000 to view it in the browser the page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code you will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console npm test or yarn test runs the test watcher in an interactive mode by default runs tests related to files changed since the last commit read more about testing npm run build or yarn build builds the app for production to the build folder it correctly bundles react in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance the build is minified and the filenames include the hashes by default it also includes a service worker so that your app loads from local cache on future visits your app is ready to be deployed user guide the user guide includes information on different topics such as updating to new releases folder structure available scripts supported browsers supported language features and polyfills syntax highlighting in the editor displaying lint output in the editor formatting code automatically debugging in the editor changing the page title installing a dependency importing a component code splitting adding a stylesheet post processing css adding a css preprocessor sass less etc adding images fonts and files using the public folder using global variables adding bootstrap adding flow adding a router adding custom environment variables can i use decorators fetching data with ajax requests integrating with an api backend proxying api requests in development using https in development generating dynamic meta tags on the server pre rendering into static html files running tests debugging tests developing components in isolation publishing components to npm making a progressive web app analyzing the bundle size deployment advanced configuration troubleshooting a copy of the user guide will be created as readme md in your project folder how to update to new versions please refer to the user guide for this and other information philosophy one dependency there is just one build dependency it uses webpack babel eslint and other amazing projects but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them no configuration required you dont need to configure anything reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code no lock in you can “eject” to a custom setup at any time run a single command and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project so you can pick up right where you left off whats included your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single page react app react jsx es6 and flow syntax support language extras beyond es6 like the object spread operator autoprefixed css so you dont need webkit or other prefixes a fast interactive unit test runner with built in support for coverage reporting a live development server that warns about common mistakes a build script to bundle js css and images for production with hashes and sourcemaps an offline first service worker and a web app manifest meeting all the progressive web app criteria hassle free updates for the above tools with a single dependency check out this guide for an overview of how these tools fit together the tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way if your project needs more customization you can eject and customize it but then you will need to maintain this configuration popular alternatives create react app is a great fit for learning react in a comfortable and feature rich development environment starting new single page react applications creating examples with react for your libraries and components heres a few common cases where you might want to try something else if you want to try react without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies consider using a single html file or an online sandbox instead if you need to integrate react code with a server side template framework like rails or django or if youre not building a single page app consider using nwb or neutrino which are more flexible if you need to publish a react component nwb can also do this as well as neutrinos react components preset if you want to do server rendering with react and node js check out next js or razzle create react app is agnostic of the backend and just produces static html js css bundles if your website is mostly static for example a portfolio or a blog consider using gatsby instead unlike create react app it pre renders the website into html at the build time if you want to use typescript consider using create react app typescript finally if you need more customization check out neutrino and its react preset all of the above tools can work with little to no configuration if you prefer configuring the build yourself follow this guide contributing wed love to have your helping hand on create react app see contributing md for more information on what were looking for and how to get started react native looking for something similar but for react native check out create react native app acknowledgements we are grateful
