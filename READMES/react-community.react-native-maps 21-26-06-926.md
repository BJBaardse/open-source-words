react native maps react native map components for ios android installation see installation instructions see setup instructions for the included example project compatibility due to the rapid changes being made in the react native ecosystem we are not officially going to support this module on anything but the latest version of react native with that said we will do our best to stay compatible with older versions as much that is practical and the peer dependency of this requirement is set to react native explicitly for this reason if you are using an older version of react native with this module though some features may be buggy note about react requires since react native 0 25 0 react should be required from node modules react native versions from 0 18 should be working out of the box for lower versions you should add react as a dependency in your package json component api mapview component api marker component api callout component api polygon component api polyline component api circle component api overlay component api general usage js import mapview from react native maps or js var mapview require react native maps this mapview component is built so that features on the map such as markers polygons etc are specified as children of the mapview itself this provides an intuitive and react like api for declaratively controlling features on the map rendering a map with an initial region mapview jsx mapview initialregion latitude 37 78825 longitude 122 4324 latitudedelta 0 0922 longitudedelta 0 0421 using a mapview while controlling the region as state jsx getinitialstate return region latitude 37 78825 longitude 122 4324 latitudedelta 0 0922 longitudedelta 0 0421 onregionchange region this setstate region render return rendering a list of markers on a map jsx import marker from react native maps mapview region this state region onregionchange this onregionchange this state markers map marker rendering a marker with a custom view jsx marker coordinate marker latlng mycustommarkerview marker marker rendering a marker with a custom image jsx marker coordinate marker latlng image require assets pin png rendering a custom marker with a custom callout jsx import callout from react native maps draggable markers jsx mapview initialregion marker draggable coordinate this state x ondragend e this setstate x e nativeevent coordinate mapview using a custom tile overlay tile overlay using tile server jsx import urltile from react native maps mapview region this state region onregionchange this onregionchange for android add the following line in your androidmanifest xml xml uses permission android name android permission internet for ios configure app transport security in your app tile overlay using local tiles tiles can be stored locally within device using xyz tiling scheme and displayed as tile overlay as well this is usefull especially for offline map usage when tiles are available for selected map region within device storage jsx import localtile from react native maps mapview region this state region onregionchange this onregionchange for android localtile is still just overlay over original map tiles it means that if device is online underlying tiles will be still downloaded if original tiles download display is not desirable set maptype to none for example mapview maptype platform os android none standard see osm wiki for how to download tiles for offline usage customizing the map style create the json object or download a generated one from the google style generator jsx the generated json object mapstyle render return for ios in addition to providing themapstyle you will need to do the following jsx import mapview provider google from react native maps mapview provider provider google custommapstyle mapstyle then add the airgooglemaps directory https github com airbnb react native maps blob 1e71a21f39e7b88554852951f773c731c94680c9 docs installation md ios an unofficial step by step guide is also available at https gist github com heron2014 e60fa003e9b117ce80d56bb1d5bfe9e0 examples to run examples bash npm i npm start android npm run run android ios npm run build ios npm run run ios mapview events the mapview component and its child components have several events that you can subscribe to this example displays some of them in a log as a demonstration tracking region location programmatically changing region one can change the mapviews position using refs and component methods or by passing in an updated region prop the component methods will allow one to animate to a given position like the native api could changing the style of the map arbitrary react views as markers using the mapview with the animated api the mapview component can be made to work with the animated api having the entire region prop be declared as an animated value this allows one to animate the zoom and position of the mapview along with other gestures giving a nice feel further marker views can use the animated api to enhance the effect issue since android needs to render its marker views as a bitmap the animations apis may not be compatible with the marker views not sure if this can be worked around yet or not markers coordinates can also be animated as shown in this example polygon creator other overlays so far circle polygon and polyline are available to pass in as children to the mapview component gradient polylines ios mapkit only gradient polylines can be created using the strokecolors prop of the polyline component default markers default markers will be rendered unless a custom marker is specified one can optionally adjust the color of the default marker by using the pincolor prop custom callouts callouts to markers can be completely arbitrary react views similar to markers as a result they can be interacted with like any other view additionally you can fall back to the standard behavior of just having a title description through the marker s title and description props custom callout views can be the entire tooltip bubble or just the content inside of the system default bubble image based markers markers can be customized by just using images and specified using the image prop draggable markers markers are draggable and emit continuous drag events to update other ui during drags lite mode android enable lite mode on android with litemode prop ideal when having multiple maps in a view or scrollview on poi click google maps only poi are clickable you can catch the event to get its information usually to get the full detail from google place using the placeid animated region the mapview can accept an animatedregion value as its region prop this allows you to utilize the animated api to control the maps center and zoom jsx import mapview animatedregion animated from react native maps getinitialstate return region new animatedregion latitude latitude longitude longitude latitudedelta latitude delta longitudedelta longitude delta onregionchange region this state region setvalue region render return animated marker position markers can also accept an animatedregion value as a coordinate jsx import mapview animatedregion marker

specified markers pass an array of marker identifiers to have the map re focus zoom to specified coordinates pass an array of coordinates to focus a map region on said coordinates troubleshooting my map is blank make sure that you have properly installed react native maps check in the logs if there is more informations about the issue try setting the style of the mapview to an absolute position with top left right and bottom values set make sure you have enabled google maps api in javascript const styles stylesheet create map stylesheet absolutefillobject jsx mapview style styles map other props inputs dont focus when inputs dont focus or elements dont respond to tap look at the order of the view hierarchy sometimes the issue could be due to ordering of rendered components prefer putting mapview as the first component bad jsx view textinput mapview view good jsx view mapview textinput view license copyright c 2017 airbnb licensed under the the mit license mit the license you
