expressive http middleware framework for node js to make web applications and apis more enjoyable to write koas middleware stack flows in a stack like manner allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter and manipulate the response upstream only methods that are common to nearly all http servers are integrated directly into koas small 570 sloc codebase this includes things like content negotiation normalization of node inconsistencies redirection and a few others koa is not bundled with any middleware installation koa requires node v7 6 0 or higher for es2015 and async function support npm install koa hello koa js const koa require koa const app new koa response app use ctx ctx body hello koa app listen 3000 getting started kick off koa an intro to koa via a set of self guided workshops workshop a workshop to learn the basics of koa express spiritual successor introduction screencast an introduction to installing and getting started with koa middleware koa is a middleware framework that can take two different kinds of functions as middleware async function common function here is an example of logger middleware with each of the different functions async functions node v7 6 js app use async ctx next const start date now await next const ms date now start console log ctx method ctx url ms ms common function js middleware normally takes two parameters ctx next ctx is the context for one request next is a function that is invoked to execute the downstream middleware it returns a promise with a then function for running code after completion app use ctx next const start date now return next then const ms date now start console log ctx method ctx url ms ms koa v1 x middleware signature the middleware signature changed between v1 x and v2 x the older signature is deprecated old signature middleware support will be removed in v3 please see the migration guide for more information on upgrading from v1 x and using v1 x middleware with v2 x context request and response each middleware receives a koa context object that encapsulates an incoming http message and the corresponding response to that message ctx is often used as the parameter name for the context object js app use async ctx next await next koa provides a request object as the request property of the context koas request object provides helpful methods for working with http requests which delegate to an incomingmessage from the node http module here is an example of checking that a requesting client supports xml js app use async ctx next ctx assert ctx request accepts xml 406 equivalent to if ctx request accepts xml ctx throw 406 await next koa provides a response object as the response property of the context koas response object provides helpful methods for working with http responses which delegate to a serverresponse koas pattern of delegating to nodes request and response objects rather than extending them provides a cleaner interface and reduces conflicts between different middleware and with node itself as well as providing better support for stream handling the incomingmessage can still be directly accessed as the req property on the context and serverresponse can be directly accessed as the res property on the context here is an example using koas response object to stream a file as the response body js app use async ctx next await next ctx response type xml ctx response body fs createreadstream really large xml the context object also provides shortcuts for methods on its request and response in the prior examples ctx type can be used instead of ctx request type and ctx accepts can be used instead of ctx request accepts for more information on request response and context see the request api reference response api reference and context api reference koa application the object created when executing new koa is known as the koa application object the application object is koas interface with nodes http server and handles the registration of middleware dispatching to the middleware from http default error handling as well as configuration of the context request and response objects learn more about the application object in the application api reference documentation usage guide error handling koa for express users faq api documentation babel setup if youre not using node v7 6 we recommend setting up babel with babel preset env bash npm install babel register babel preset env save setup babel register in your entry file js require babel register and have your babelrc setup json presets env
