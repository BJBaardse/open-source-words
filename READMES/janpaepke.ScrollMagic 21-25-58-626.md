scrollmagic v2 0 5 the javascript library for magical scroll interactions scrollmagic helps you to easily react to the users current scroll position its the perfect library for you if you want to animate based on scroll position – either trigger an animation or synchronize it to the scrollbar movement like a playback scrub control pin an element starting at a specific scroll position – either indefinitely or for a limited amount of scroll progress sticky elements toggle css classes of elements on and off based on scroll position effortlessly add parallax effects to your website create an infinitely scrolling page ajax load of additional content add callbacks at specific scroll positions or while scrolling past a specific section passing a progress parameter check out the demo page browse the examples or read the documentation to get started about the library scrollmagic is a scroll interaction library its a complete rewrite of its predecessor superscrollorama by john polacek a plugin based architecture offers easy customizability and extendability to implement animations scrollmagic can work with multiple frameworks the recommended solution is the greensock animation platform gsap due to its stability and feature richness for a more lightweight approach the velocityjs framework is also supported alternatively custom extensions can be implemented or the necessity of a framework can be completely avoided by animating simply using css and class toggles scrollmagic was developed with these principles in mind optimized performance lightweight 6kb gzipped flexibility and extendibility mobile compatibility event management support for responsive web design object oriented programming and object chaining readable centralized code and intuitive development support for both scroll directions even different on one page support for scrolling inside div containers even multiple on one page extensive debugging and logging capabilities detailed documentation many application examples is scrollmagic the right library for you scrollmagic takes an object oriented approach using a controller for each scroll container and attaching multiple scenes defining what should happen at what part of the page while this offers a great deal of control it might be a little confusing especially if youre just starting out with javascript if the above points are not crucial for you and you are just looking for a simple solution to implement css animations i would strongly recommend taking a look at the awesome skrollr project it almost solely relies on element attributes and thus requires minimal to no javascript knowledge availability to get your copy of scrollmagic you have the choice between four options option 1 github download a zip file containing the source code demo page all examples and documentation from the github releases page or clone the package to your machine using the git command line interface bash git clone git github com janpaepke scrollmagic git option 2 bower scrollmagic is also available on bower and will only install the necessary source code ignoring all example and documentation files please mind that since they are not core dependencies you will have to add frameworks like gsap jquery or velocity manually should you choose to use them bash bower install scrollmagic option 3 npm if you prefer the node package manager feel free to use it keep in mind that like with bower non crucial files will be ignored see above bash npm install scrollmagic option 4 cdn if you dont want to host scrollmagic

design pattern is one controller which has one or more scenes attached to it each scene is used to define what happens when the container is scrolled to a specific offset heres a basic workflow example javascript init controller var controller new scrollmagic controller create a scene new scrollmagic scene duration 100 the scene should last for a scroll distance of 100px offset 50 start this scene after scrolling for 50px setpin my sticky element pins the element for the the scenes duration addto controller assign the scene to the controller to learn more about the scrollmagic code
