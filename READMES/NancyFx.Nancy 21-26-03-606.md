meet nancy nancy is a lightweight low ceremony framework for building http based services on net framework core and mono the goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super duper happy path to all interactions nancy is designed to handle delete get head options post put and patch requests and provides a simple elegant domain specific language dsl for returning a response with just a couple of keystrokes leaving you with more time to focus on the important bits your code and your application write your application csharp public class module nancymodule public module get greet name x return string concat hello x name compile run and enjoy the simple elegant design features built from the bottom up not simply a dsl on top of an existing framework removing limitations and feature hacks of an underlying framework as well as the need to reference more assemblies than you need keep it light run anywhere nancy is not built on any specific hosting technology can be run anywhere out of the box nancy supports running on asp net iis wcf self hosting and any owin ultra lightweight action declarations for get head put post delete options and patch requests view engine integration razor spark dotliquid our own supersimpleviewengine and many more powerful request path matching that includes advanced parameter capabilities the path matching strategy can be replaced with custom implementations to fit your exact needs easy response syntax enabling you to return things like int string httpstatuscode and action elements without having to explicitly cast or wrap your response you just return it and nancy will do the work for you a powerful light weight testing framework to help you verify the behavior of your application content negotiation and much much more the super duper happy path the super duper happy path or sdhp if youre ‘down with the kids is a phrase we coined to describe the ethos of nancy and providing the “super duper happy path” experience is something we strive for in all of our apis while its hard to pin down exactly what it is its a very emotive term after all but the basic ideas behind it are “it just works” you should be able to pick things up and use them without any mucking about added a new module thats automatically discovered for you brought in a new view engine all wired up and ready to go without you having to do anything else even if you add a new dependency to your module by default well locate that and inject it for you no configuration required “easily customisable” even though “it just works” there shouldnt be any barriers that get in the way of customisation should you want to work the way you want to work with the components that you want to use want to use another container no problem want to tweak the way routes are selected go ahead through our bootstrapper approach all of these things should be a piece of cake “low ceremony” the amount of “nancy code” you should need in your application should be minimal the important part of any nancy application is your code our code should get out of your way and let you get on with building awesome applications as a testament to this its actually possible to fit a functional nancy application into a single tweet “low friction” when building software with nancy the apis should help you get where you want to go rather than getting in your way naming should be obvious required configuration should be minimal but power and extensibility should still be there when you need it above all creating an application with nancy should be a pleasure and hopefully fun but without sacrificing the power or extensibility that you may need as your application grows getting started as a start several working samples are provided in the sample directory simply run the build script build ps1 for windows powershell or build sh for nix bash first community nancy followers can be found on slack nancyfx team you can also find nancy on
