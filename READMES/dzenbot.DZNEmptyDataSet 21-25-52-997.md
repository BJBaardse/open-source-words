dznemptydataset projects using this library add your project to the list here and provide a 320px wide render of the result the empty data set pattern also known as empty state or blank slate most applications show lists of content data sets which many turn out to be empty at one point specially for new users with blank accounts empty screens create confusion by not being clear about whats going on if there is an error bug or if the user is supposed to do something within your app to be able to consume the content please read this very interesting article about designing for the empty states these are real life examples available in the applications sample project in the v2 swift branch empty data sets are helpful for avoiding white screens and communicating to your users why the screen is empty calling to action particularly as an onboarding process avoiding other interruptive mechanisms like showing error alerts being consistent and improving the user experience delivering a brand presence features compatible with uitableview and uicollectionview also compatible with uisearchdisplaycontroller and uiscrollview gives multiple possibilities of layout and appearance by showing an image and or title label and or description label and or button uses nsattributedstring for easier appearance customisation uses auto layout to automagically center the content to the tableview with auto rotation support also accepts custom vertical and horizontal alignment background color customisation allows tap gesture on the whole tableview rectangle useful for resigning first responder or similar actions for more advanced customisation it allows a custom view compatible with storyboard compatible with ios 6 tvos 9 or later compatible with iphone ipad and apple tv app store ready this library has been designed in a way where you wont need to extend uitableview or uicollectionview class it will still work when using uitableviewcontroller or uicollectionviewcontroller by just conforming to dznemptydatasetsource dznemptydatasetdelegate you will be able to fully customize the content and appearance of the empty states for your application installation available in

something refresh layout if you need to refresh the empty state layout simply call objc self tableview reloaddata or objc self collectionview reloaddata depending of which you are using force layout update you can also call self tableview reloademptydataset to invalidate the current empty state layout and trigger a layout update bypassing reloaddata this might be useful if you have a lot of logic on your data source that you want to avoid calling when not needed self scrollview reloademptydataset is the only way to refresh content when using with uiscrollview sample projects applications this project replicates several popular applications empty states 20 with their exact content and appearance such as airbnb dropbox facebook foursquare and many others see how easy and flexible it is to customize the appearance of your empty states you can also use this project as a playground to test things countries this project shows a list of the world countries loaded from coredata it uses nsfecthedresultcontroller for filtering search when searching and no content is matched a simple empty state is shown see how to interact between the uitableviewdatasource and the dznemptydatasetsource protocols while using a typical coredata stack colors this project is a simple example of how this library also works with uicollectionview and uisearchdisplaycontroller while
