one file any browser same ui author john dyer http j hn website http mediaelementjs com license mit meaning use everywhere keep copyright itd be swell if youd link back here thanks my employer dallas theological seminary contributors all contributors table of contents introduction migrating from 2 x to 4 x version installation and usage api and configuration guidelines for contributors change log todo list introduction mediaelementplayer html5 video and audio player a complete html css audio video player built on top mediaelement js many great html5 players have a completely separate flash ui in fallback mode but mediaelementplayer js uses the same html css for all players mediaelement js is a set of custom flash plugins that mimic the html5 mediaelement api for browsers that dont support html5 or dont support the media codecs youre using instead of using flash as a fallback flash is used to make the browser seem html5 compliant and enable codecs like h 264 via flash on all browsers in general mediaelement js supports ie11 ms edge chrome firefox safari ios 8 and android 4 0 it is strongly recommended to read the entire documentation and check the demo folder to get the most out of this package visit here to start important note for safari users jun 8 2017 since sierra version autoplay policies have changed you may experience an error if you try to execute play programatically or via autoplay attribute with mediaelement unless muted attribute is specified for more information read https webkit org blog 7734 auto play policy changes for macos important changes on 4 2 0 version as part of the continuous improvements the player we have decided to drop completely support for ie9 and ie10 since market share of those browsers together is 0 4 according to http caniuse com usage table this change is for mediaelement and mediaelement plugins repositories important migrating from 2 x to 4 x version note 3 x version has jquery in the code base and 4 x is framework agnostic so for either 3 x or 4 x versions the following steps are valid but it is highly recommended to upgrade to 4 x in order to successfully install 4 x in an existing setup you must consider the following guidelines if your installation relies on the legacy player classes i e mejs player mejs container etc you must set up the proper namespace in 2 x the default namespace is mejs but now is mejs in order to set up a new namespace or the legacy one use the classprefix configuration and make sure you use the mediaelementplayer legacy stylesheet provided in the build folder by default mediaelement has bundled native renderers such as hls m peg dash and flv as well as youtube and flash shims if you want to use any other renderer you must refer to the build renderers folder and add as many as you want check demo index html for a better reference you must set up now the path for the flash shims if they are not in the same folder as the js files to do this set the path via the pluginpath configuration in the same topic if you need to support browsers with javascript disabled you must reference the correct flash shim since in 2 x there was only a single flash shim and in 3 x it was split to target specific media types check the browsers with javascript disabled section for more details if you want to use flash shims from a cdn do the change related to pluginpath setting the cdns url and also setting shimscriptaccess configuration as always if you need to force the flash shim the way to do it in 3 x version is to use the renderers configuration and list them in an array plugintype was removed to favor renderername if you rely on that element just create conditionals based on the renderer id all listed here for example javascript video audio mediaelementplayer
