jquery ui bootstrap this project was started to bring the beauty and ease of use of twitter bootstrap to jquery ui widgets â™¥ why bootstrap is one of our favorite projects but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things the ability to work side by side with jquery ui something which caused a number of widgets to break visually the ability to theme jquery ui widgets using bootstrap styles whilst we love jquery ui we find some of the current themes to look a little dated our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same to clarify this project doesnt aim or intend to replace twitter bootstrap it merely provides a jquery ui compatible theme inspired by bootstraps design it also provides a version of bootstrap css with a few minor sections commented out which enable the theme to work along side it we welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible browser support all modern browsers are targeted by this theme with lo res experiences i e no gradients border radius etc provided for users using older browsers there are some minor known issues lingering that im working on but the hope is that in time those will all get ironed out jquery ui support this theme targets jquery ui 1 9 2 and the default version of jquery included in the current jquery ui builds jquery 1 6 2 project status this project is under active but slow development there has been a great deal of work done in branches to introduce compatibility with jquery ui 1 9 and further work done to move us towards using less and improved parity with bootstrap 2 x at this time we are seeking contributors interested in helping us finally complete the work needed to be bootstrap 2 x compatible this would involve helping in your spare time across a few weeks and you would be given credit in the project readme as one of the currently more popular open source jquery ui themes we would love to get out more frequent releases and your help with this would be greatly appreciated team addy osmani gerits aurelien you were always open to improvements demo for a live preview of the current theme see http addyosmani github com jquery ui bootstrap
