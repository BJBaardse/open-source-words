graphiql ˈɡrafək ə l a graphical interactive in browser graphql ide try the live demo getting started using a node js server just use express graphql it can automatically present graphiql using another graphql service graphiql is pretty easy to set up with npm npm install save graphiql alternatively if you are using yarn yarn add graphiql graphiql provides a react component responsible for rendering the ui which should be provided with a function for fetching from graphql we recommend using the fetch standard api js import react from react import reactdom from react dom import graphiql from graphiql import fetch from isomorphic fetch function graphqlfetcher graphqlparams return fetch window location origin graphql method post headers content type application json body json stringify graphqlparams then response response json reactdom render document body build for the web with webpack or browserify or use the pre bundled graphiql js file see the example in the git repository to see how to use the pre bundled file dont forget to include the css file on the page if youre using npm or yarn you can find it in node modules graphiql graphiql css or you can download it from the releases page for an example of setting up a graphiql check out the example in this repository which also includes a few useful features highlighting graphiqls api features syntax highlighting intelligent type ahead of fields arguments types and more real time error highlighting and reporting automatic query completion run and inspect query results usage graphiql exports a single react component which is intended to encompass the entire browser viewport this react component renders the graphiql editor js import graphiql from graphiql graphiql supports customization in ui and behavior by accepting react props and children props fetcher a function which accepts graphql http parameters and returns a promise or observable which resolves to the graphql parsed json response schema a graphqlschema instance or null if one is not to be used if undefined is provided graphiql will send an introspection query using the fetcher to produce a schema query an optional graphql string to use as the initial displayed query if undefined is provided the stored query or defaultquery will be used variables an optional graphql string to use as the initial displayed query variables if undefined is provided the stored variables will be used operationname an optional name of which graphql operation should be executed response an optional json string to use as the initial displayed response if not provided no response will be initially shown you might provide this if illustrating the result of the initial query storage an instance of storage graphiql will use to persist state default window localstorage defaultquery an optional graphql string to use when no query is provided and no stored query exists from a previous session if undefined is provided graphiql will use its own default query oneditquery an optional function which will be called when the query editor changes the argument to the function will be the query string oneditvariables an optional function which will be called when the query variable editor changes the argument to the function will be the variables string oneditoperationname an optional function which will be called when the operation name to be executed changes ontoggledocs an optional function which will be called when the docs will be toggled the argument to the function will be a boolean whether the docs are now open or closed getdefaultfieldnames an optional function used to provide default fields to non leaf fields which invalidly lack a selection set accepts a graphqltype instance and returns an array of field names if not provided a default behavior will be used editortheme an optional string naming a codemirror theme to be applied to the queryeditor resultviewer and variables panes defaults to the graphiql theme see below for full usage children graphiql logo replace the graphiql logo with your own graphiql toolbar add a custom toolbar above graphiql if not provided a default toolbar may contain common operations pass the empty graphiql toolbar if an empty toolbar is desired graphiql button add a button to the toolbar above graphiql graphiql menu add a dropdown menu to the toolbar above graphiql graphiql menuitem items for a menu graphiql select add a select list to the toolbar above graphiql graphiql selectoption options for a select list graphiql group add a group of associated controls to the toolbar above graphiql expects children to be graphiql button graphiql menu or graphiql select graphiql footer add a custom footer below graphiql results usage examples js class customgraphiql extends react component constructor props super props this state required fetcher must be provided in order for graphiql to operate fetcher this props fetcher optional parameters graphql artifacts query variables response graphql schema if undefined is provided an introspection query is executed using the fetcher schema undefined useful to determine which operation to run when there are multiple of them operationname null storage null defaultquery null custom event handlers oneditquery null oneditvariables null oneditoperationname null graphiql automatically fills in leaf nodes when the query does not provide them change this if your graphql definitions should behave differently than whats defined here https github com graphql graphiql blob master src utility fillleafs js l75

theme in order to theme the editor portions of the interface you can supply a editortheme prop youll also need to load the appropriate css for the theme similar to loading the css for this project see the themes available here js in your html in your graphiql jsx query samples query graphql queries declaratively describe what data the issuer wishes to fetch from whoever is fulfilling the graphql

fragments allow for the reuse of common repeated selections of fields reducing duplicated text in the document inline fragments can be used directly within a selection to condition upon a type condition when querying against an interface or union therefore instead of the following query luke human id 1000 name homeplanet leia human id 1003 name homeplanet using fragments the following query is possible luke human id 1000 humanfragment leia human id 1003 humanfragment fragment humanfragment on human name homeplanet read more from graphql fragment specification
