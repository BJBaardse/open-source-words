preact but give it a try the easiest way to get started with preact is to install preact cli this simple command line tool wraps up the best possible webpack and babel setup for you and even keeps you up to date as the underlying tools change best of all its easy to understand it builds your app in a single command preact build doesnt need any configuration and bakes in best practises üôå the following guide assumes you have some sort of es2015 build set up using babel and or webpack browserify gulp grunt etc you can also start with preact boilerplate or a codepen template import what you need the preact module provides both named and default exports so you can either import everything under a namespace of your choosing or just what you need as locals named js import h render component from preact tell babel to transform jsx into h calls jsx h default js import preact from preact tell babel to transform jsx into preact h calls jsx preact h named imports work well for highly structured applications whereas the default import is quick and never needs to be updated when using different parts of the library instead of declaring the jsx pragma in your code its best to configure it globally in a babelrc for babel 5 and prior json jsxpragma h for babel 6 json plugins transform react jsx pragma h for using preact along with typescript add to tsconfig json json jsx react jsxfactory h rendering jsx out of the box preact provides an h function that turns your jsx into virtual dom elements heres how it also provides a render function that creates a dom tree from that virtual dom to render some jsx just import those two functions and use them like so js import h render from preact render hello world alert hi click me document body this should seem pretty straightforward if youve used hyperscript or one of its many friends if youre not the short of it is that the h function import gets used in the final transpiled code as a drop in replacement for react createelement and so needs to be imported even if you dont explicitly use it in the code you write also note that if youre the kind of person who likes writing your react code in pure javascript you know who you are you will need to use h wherever you would otherwise use react createelement rendering hyperscript with a virtual dom is pointless though we want to render components and have them updated when data changes thats where the power of virtual dom diffing shines star2 components preact exports a generic component class which can be extended to build encapsulated self updating pieces of a user interface components support all of the standard react lifecycle methods like shouldcomponentupdate and componentwillreceiveprops providing specific implementations of these methods is the preferred mechanism for controlling when and how components update components also have a render method but unlike react this method is passed props state as arguments this provides an ergonomic means to destructure props and state into local variables to be referenced from jsx lets take a look at a very simple clock component which shows the current time js import h render component from preact class clock extends component render let time new date return time tolocaletimestring render an instance of clock into render document body thats great running this produces the following html dom structure html span 10 28 57 pm span in order to have the clocks time update every second we need to know when clock gets mounted to the dom if youve used html5 custom elements this is similar to the attachedcallback and detachedcallback lifecycle methods preact invokes the following lifecycle methods if they are defined for a component lifecycle method when it gets called componentwillmount before the component gets mounted to the dom componentdidmount after the component gets mounted to the dom componentwillunmount prior to removal from the dom componentwillreceiveprops before new props get accepted shouldcomponentupdate before render return false to skip render componentwillupdate before render componentdidupdate after render so we want to have a 1 second timer start once the component gets added to the dom and stop if it is removed well create the timer and store a reference to it in componentdidmount and stop the timer in componentwillunmount on each timer tick well update the components state object with a new time value doing this will automatically re render the component js import h render component from preact class clock extends component constructor super set initial time this state time date now componentdidmount update time every second this timer setinterval this setstate time date now 1000 componentwillunmount stop when not renderable clearinterval this timer render props state let time new date state time tolocaletimestring return span time span render an instance of clock into render document body now we have a ticking clock props state the concept and nomenclature for props and state is the same as in react props are passed to a component by defining attributes in jsx state is internal state changing either triggers a re render though by default preact re renders components asynchronously for state changes and synchronously for props changes you can tell preact to render prop changes asynchronously by setting options synccomponentupdates to false linked state one area preact takes a little further than react is in optimizing state changes a common pattern in es2015 react code is to use arrow functions within a render method in order to update state in response to events creating functions enclosed in a scope on every render is inefficient and forces the garbage collector to do more work than is necessary one solution to this is to bind component methods declaratively here is an example using decko js class foo extends component bind updatetext e this setstate text e target value render text return input value text oninput this updatetext while this achieves much better runtime performance its still a lot of unnecessary code to wire up state to ui fortunately there is a solution in the form of a module called linkstate calling linkstate component text returns a function that accepts an event and uses its associated value to update the given property in your components state calls to linkstate with the same arguments are cached so there is no performance penalty here is the previous example rewritten using linked state js import linkstate from linkstate class foo extends component render text return simple and effective it handles linking state from any input type or an optional second parameter can be used to explicitly provide a keypath to the new state value note in preact 7 and prior linkstate was built right into component in 8 0 it was moved to a separate module you can restore the 7 x behavior by using linkstate as a polyfill see the linkstate docs examples here is a somewhat verbose preact link component js class link extends component render props state return a href props href props children a since this is es6 es2015 we can further simplify js class link extends component render href children return or for wide open props support class link extends component render props return or as a stateless functional component const link children props children extensions it is likely that some projects based on preact would wish to extend component with great new functionality perhaps automatic connection to stores for a flux like architecture or mixed in context bindings to make it feel more like react createclass just use es2015 inheritance js class boundcomponent extends component constructor props super props this bind bind this binds for let i in this this binds i this i bind this example usage class link extends boundcomponent click open this href render let click this binds return children the possibilities are pretty endless here you could even add support for rudimentary mixins js class mixedcomponent extends component constructor super this mixins foreach m object assign this m debug mode you can inspect and modify the state of your preact ui components at runtime using the react developer tools browser extension install the react developer tools extension import the preact debug module in your app set process env node env to development reload and go to the react tab in the browsers development tools js import h component render from preact enable debug mode you can reduce the size of your app by only including this module in development builds eg in webpack wrap this with an if module hot check require preact debug runtime error checking to enable debug mode you need to set process env node env development you can do this with webpack via a builtin plugin js webpack config js set node env development to enable error checking new webpack defineplugin process env node env json stringify development when enabled warnings are logged to the console when undefined components or string refs are detected developer tools if you only want to include devtool integration without runtime error checking you can replace preact debug in the above example with preact devtools this option doesnt require setting node env development backers support us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities
