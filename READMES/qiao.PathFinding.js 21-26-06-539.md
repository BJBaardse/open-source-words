pathfinding js a comprehensive path finding library in javascript introduction the aim of this project is to provide a path finding library that can be easily incorporated into web games it may run on node js or the browser it comes along with an online demo to show how the algorithms execute the pathfinding speed is slowed down in the demo note that this project only provides path finding algorithms for 2d space if you need to work in a 3d environment then you may use schteppes fork there is new documentation being written for pathfinding js you can read it here note that this is in very early stages and far from complete so keep your eyes open for mistakes and dont hesitate to open a pull request in case you find one server if you want to use it in node js you may install it via npm bash npm install pathfinding then in your program javascript var pf require pathfinding see the basic usage section below for usage details browser if you have bower installed then you can install it with the following command bash bower install pathfinding by default bower will install pathfinding under the bower components folder so to include it in your page do something like html script type text javascript src path to bower components pathfinding pathfinding browser min js script you can also grab a release from the releases page if you dont use bower basic usage to build a grid map of width 5 and height 3 javascript var grid new pf grid 5 3 by default all the nodes in the grid will be able to be walked through to set whether a node at a given coordinate is walkable or not use the setwalkableat method for example to set the node at 0 1 to be un walkable where 0 is the x coordinate from left to right and 1 is the y coordinate from up to down javascript grid setwalkableat 0 1 false you may also pass in a matrix while instantiating the pf grid class it will initiate all the nodes in the grid with the same walkability indicated by the matrix 0 for walkable while 1 for blocked javascript var matrix 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 var grid new pf grid matrix currently there are 10 path finders bundled in this library namely astarfinder bestfirstfinder breadthfirstfinder dijkstrafinder idastarfinder js jumppointfinder orthogonaljumppointfinder biastarfinder bibestfirstfinder bibreadthfirstfinder bidijkstrafinder the prefix bi for the last four finders in the above list stands for the bi directional searching strategy also note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path to build a path finder say the astarfinder javascript var finder new pf astarfinder to find a path from 1 2 to 4 2 note both the start point and end point should be walkable javascript var path finder findpath 1 2 4 2 grid path will be an array of coordinates including both the start and end positions for the matrix defined previously the path will be javascript 1 2 1 1 2 1 3 1 3 2 4 2 be aware that grid will be modified in each path finding and will not be usable afterwards if you want to use a single grid multiple times create a clone for it before calling findpath javascript var gridbackup grid clone advanced usage when instantiating path finders you may pass in additional parameters to indicate which specific strategies to use for all path finders you may indicate whether diagonal movement is allowed the default value is false which means that the path can only go orthogonally in order to enable diagonal movement javascript var finder new pf astarfinder allowdiagonal true when diagonal movement is enabled you might want to prevent the path from touching the corners of the occupied grid blocks this is usually desirable if the objects using the path have physical width and can also move between the grid cells to enable the corner crossing prevention javascript var finder new pf astarfinder allowdiagonal true dontcrosscorners true note that dontcrosscorners only makes sense when allowdiagonal is also used currently all algorithms except jumppointfinder support this feature for astarfinder bestfirstfinder and all their bi relatives you may indicate which heuristic function to use the predefined heuristics are pf heuristic manhattan default pf heuristic chebyshev pf heuristic euclidean and pf heuristic octile to use the chebyshev heuristic javascript var finder new pf astarfinder heuristic pf heuristic chebyshev to build a bestfirstfinder with diagonal movement allowed and a custom heuristic function javascript var finder new pf bestfirstfinder allowdiagonal true heuristic function dx dy return math min dx dy to smoothen the path you may use pf util smoothenpath this routine will return a new path with the original one unmodified javascript var newpath pf util smoothenpath grid path note that the new path will be compressed as well i e if the original path is 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 then the new path will be 0 1 0 4 to just compress a path without smoothing it you may use pf util compresspath javascript var newpath pf util compresspath path to expand the compressed path like 0 1 0 4 back to 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 you may use pf util expandpath javascript var newpath pf util expandpath path development layout lib browser distribution src source code algorithms only test test scripts utils build scripts benchmark benchmarks visual visualization make sure you have node js installed then use npm to install the dependencies npm install d the build system uses gulp so make sure you have it installed npm install d g gulp to build the browser distribution gulp compile to run the tests algorithms only not including the visualization with mocha and should js first install mocha npm install d g mocha then run the tests gulp test to run the benchmarks gulp bench or if you are feeling lazy the default gulp task does everything except running the benchmarks gulp license mit license Â© 2011 2012 xueqiao xu xueqiaoxu gmail com permission is hereby granted
