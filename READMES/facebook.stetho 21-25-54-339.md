stetho stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for android applications when enabled developers have access to the chrome developer tools feature natively part of the chrome desktop browser developers can also choose to enable the optional dumpapp tool which offers a powerful command line interface to application internals once you complete the set up instructions below just start your app and point your laptop browser to chrome inspect click the inspect button to begin set up download download the latest jars or grab via gradle groovy compile com facebook stetho stetho 1 5 0 or maven xml dependency groupid com facebook stetho groupid artifactid stetho artifactid version 1 5 0 version dependency only the main stetho dependency is strictly required however you may also wish to use one of the network helpers groovy compile com facebook stetho stetho okhttp3 1 5 0 or groovy compile com facebook stetho stetho urlconnection 1 5 0 you can also enable a javascript console with groovy compile com facebook stetho stetho js rhino 1 5 0 for more details on how to customize the javascript runtime see stetho js rhino putting it together integrating with stetho is intended to be seamless and straightforward for most existing android applications there is a simple initialization step which occurs in your application class java public class myapplication extends application public void oncreate super oncreate stetho initializewithdefaults this also ensure that your myapplication java class is registered in your androidmanifest xml file otherwise you will not see an inspect button in chrome inspect devices xml manifest xmlns android http schemas android com apk res android application android name myapplication application manifest this brings up most of the default configuration but does not enable some additional hooks most notably network inspection see below for specific details on individual subsystems enable network inspection if you are using the popular okhttp library at the 3 x release you can use the interceptors system to automatically hook into your existing stack this is currently the simplest and most straightforward way to enable network inspection java new okhttpclient builder addnetworkinterceptor new stethointerceptor build note that okhttp 2 x will work as well but with slightly different syntax and you must use the stetho okhttp artifact not stetho okhttp3 as interceptors can modify the request and response add the stetho interceptor after all others to get an accurate view of the network traffic if you are using httpurlconnection you can use stethourlconnectionmanager to assist with integration though you should be aware that there are some caveats with this approach in particular you must explicitly add accept encoding gzip to the request headers and manually handle compressed responses in order for stetho to report compressed payload sizes see the stetho sample project for more details going further custom dumpapp plugins custom plugins are the preferred means of extending the dumpapp system and can be added easily during configuration simply replace your configuration step as such java stetho initialize stetho newinitializerbuilder context enabledumpapp new dumperpluginsprovider override public iterable dumperplugin get return new stetho defaultdumperpluginsbuilder context provide new mydumperplugin finish enablewebkitinspector stetho defaultinspectormodulesprovider context build see the stetho sample project for more details improve stetho see the contributing md file for how to help out license stetho is bsd licensed we also provide an additional patent grant
