visit our official web site for more information and latest updates on pinpoint the current stable version is v1 7 3 pinpoint is an apm application performance management tool for large scale distributed systems written in java inspired by dapper pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications you should definitely check pinpoint out if you want to understand your application topology at a glance monitor your application in real time gain code level visibility to every transaction install apm agents without changing a single line of code have minimal impact on the performance approximately 3 increase in resource usage getting started quick start guide for simple test run of pinpoint installation guide for further instructions overview services nowadays often consist of many different components communicating amongst themselves as well as making api calls to external services how each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a blackbox pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks for a more intimate guide please check out our introduction to pinpoint video clip servermap understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected clicking on a node reveals details about the component such as its current status and transaction count realtime active thread chart monitor active threads inside applications in real time request response scatter chart visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems transactions can be selected for additional detail by dragging over the chart callstack gain code level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view inspector view additional details on the application such as cpu usage memory garbage collection tps and jvm arguments supported modules jdk 6 tomcat 6 7 8 jetty 8 9 jboss eap 6 resin 4 websphere 6 7 8 vertx 3 3 3 4 3 5 spring spring boot embedded tomcat jetty apache http client 3 x 4 x jdk httpconnector googlehttpclient okhttpclient ningasynchttpclient thrift client thrift service dubbo provider dubbo consumer activemq rabbitmq mysql oracle mssql cubrid postgresql maria arcus memcached redis cassandra ibatis mybatis dbcp dbcp2 hikaricp gson jackson json lib log4j logback compatibility java version required to run pinpoint pinpoint version agent collector web 1 0 x 6 8 6 6 1 1 x 6 8 7 7 1 5 x 6 8 7 7 1 6 x 6 8 7 7 1 7 x 6 8 8 8 1 8 x 6 8 9 experimental 8 8 hbase compatibility table pinpoint version hbase 0 94 x hbase 0 98 x hbase 1 0 x hbase 1 1 x hbase 1 2 x 1 0 x yes no no no no 1 1 x no not tested yes not tested not tested 1 5 x no not tested yes not tested not tested 1 6 x no not tested not tested not tested yes 1 7 x no not tested not tested not tested yes 1 8 x no not tested not tested not tested yes agent collector compatibility table agent version collector 1 0 x collector 1 1 x collector 1 5 x collector 1 6 x collector 1 7 x collector 1 8 x 1 0 x yes yes yes yes yes yes 1 1 x not tested yes yes yes yes yes 1 5 x no no yes yes yes yes 1 6 x no no not tested yes yes yes 1 7 x no no no no yes yes 1 8 x no no no no no yes flink compatibility table pinpoint version flink 1 3 x flink 1 4 x 1 7 x yes no user group for q a and discussion here license pinpoint is licensed under the apache license version 2 0 see license for full license text copyright 2018 naver corp licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
