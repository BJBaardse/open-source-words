fastclick fastclick is a simple easy to use library for eliminating the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the firing of a click event on mobile browsers the aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while avoiding any interference with your current logic fastclick is developed by ft labs part of the financial times note as of late 2015 most mobile browsers notably chrome and safari no longer have a 300ms touch delay so fastclick offers no benefit on newer browsers and risks introducing bugs into your application consider carefully whether you really need to use it explication en français 日本語で説明。 why does the delay exist according to google mobile browsers will wait approximately 300ms from the time that you tap the button to fire the click event the reason for this is that the browser is waiting to see if you are actually performing a double tap compatibility the library has been deployed as part of the ft web app and is tried and tested on the following mobile browsers mobile safari on ios 3 and upwards chrome on ios 5 and upwards chrome on android ics opera mobile 11 5 and upwards android browser since android 2 playbook os 1 and upwards when it isnt needed fastclick doesnt attach any listeners on desktop browsers chrome 32 on android with width device width in the viewport meta tag doesnt have a 300ms delay therefore listeners arent attached html meta name viewport content width device width initial scale 1 same goes for chrome on android all versions with user scalable no in the viewport meta tag but be aware that user scalable no also disables pinch zooming which may be an accessibility concern for ie11 you can use touch action manipulation to disable double tap to zoom on certain elements like links and buttons for ie10 use ms touch action manipulation usage include fastclick js in your javascript bundle or add it to your html page like this html script type application javascript src path to fastclick js script the script must be loaded prior to instantiating fastclick on any element of the page to instantiate fastclick on the body which is the recommended method of use js if addeventlistener in document document addeventlistener domcontentloaded function fastclick attach document body false or if youre using jquery js function fastclick attach document body if youre using browserify or another commonjs style module system the fastclick attach function will be returned when you call require fastclick as a result the easiest way to use fastclick with these loaders is as follows js var attachfastclick require fastclick attachfastclick document body minified run make to build a minified version of fastclick using the closure compiler rest api the minified file is saved to build fastclick min js or you can download a pre minified version note the pre minified version is built using our build service which exposes the fastclick object through origami fastclick and will have the browserify commonjs api see above js var attachfastclick origami fastclick attachfastclick document body amd fastclick has amd asynchronous module definition support this allows it to be lazy loaded with an amd loader such as requirejs note that when using the amd style require the full fastclick object will be returned not fastclick attach js var fastclick require fastclick fastclick attach document body options package managers you can install fastclick using component npm or bower for ruby theres a third party gem called fastclick rails for net theres a nuget package advanced ignore certain elements with needsclick sometimes you need fastclick to ignore certain elements you can do this easily by adding the needsclick class html a class needsclick ignored by fastclick a use case 1 non synthetic click required internally fastclick uses document createevent to fire a synthetic click event as soon as touchend is fired by the browser it then suppresses the additional click event created by the browser after that in some cases the non synthetic click event created by the browser is required as described in the triggering focus example this is where the needsclick class comes in add the class to any element that requires a non synthetic click use case 2 twitter bootstrap 2 2 2 dropdowns another example of when to use the needsclick class is with dropdowns in twitter bootstrap 2 2 2 bootstrap add its own touchstart listener for dropdowns so you want to tell fastclick to ignore those if you dont touch devices will automatically close the dropdown as soon as it is clicked because both fastclick and bootstrap execute the synthetic click one opens the dropdown the second closes it immediately after html a class dropdown toggle needsclick data toggle dropdown dropdown a examples fastclick is designed to cope with many different browser oddities here are some examples to illustrate this basic use showing the increase in perceived responsiveness triggering focus on an input element from a click handler input element which never receives clicks but gets fast focus tests there are no automated tests the files in tests are manual reduced test cases weve had a think about how best to test these cases but they tend to be very browser device specific and sometimes subjective which means its not so trivial to test credits and collaboration fastclick is
