vivus js demo available on http maxwellito github io vivus play with it on vivus instant vivus is a lightweight javascript class with no dependencies that allows you to animate svgs giving them the appearance of being drawn there are a variety of different animations available as well as the option to create a custom script to draw your svg in whatever way you like available via npm npm install vivus bower bower install vivus jsdelivr cdn cdn jsdelivr net npm vivus latest dist vivus min js cdnjs cdn webjars join the conversation on gitter try vivus with your svg on vivus instant if you plan to use the library to animate a single svg without callback or controls this will allow you to download your animated svg powered by css javascript free animations on the following images the pink color represents the duration value and the blue one is for delay value delayed every path element is drawn at the same time with a small delay at the start this is currently the default animation sync each line is drawn synchronously they all start and finish at the same time hence the name sync onebyone each path element is drawn one after the other this animation gives the best impression of live drawing the duration for each line depends on their length to make a constant drawing speed principles to get this effect the script uses the css property strokedashoffset this property manages the stroke offset on every line of the svg now all we have to do is add some javascript to update this value progressively and the magic begins however theres a problem with this the strokedashoffset property is only available on the path elements this is an issue because in an svg there are a lot of elements such as circle rect line and polyline which will break the animation so to fix this there is another class available in the repo called pathformer its made for transforming all objects of your svg into path elements to be able to use strokedashoffset and animate your svgs the animation always draws elements in the same order as they are defined in the svg tag there are few conditions that your svg must meet all elements must have a stroke property and cannot be filled this is because the animation only looks to progressively draw strokes and will not check for filled colours for example fill none stroke fff you should avoid creating any hidden path elements in your svg vivus considers them all eligible to be animated so it is advised to remove them before playing with it if they are not removed the animation might not achieve the desired effect with blank areas and gaps appearing text elements arent allowed they cannot be transformed into path elements see 22 for more details the code is inspired from other repositories the drawer is inspired from the excellent codrops about the post svg drawing animation if you dont know this website get ready to have your mind blown then for the pathformer there is a lot of work from svgpathconverter by waest usage as i said no dependencies here all you need to do is include the scripts inline svg html new vivus my svg duration 200 mycallback dynamic load html new vivus my svg duration 200 mycallback or html new vivus my div duration 200 file link to my svg mycallback by default the object created will take the size of the parent element this one must have a height and width or your svg might not appear if you need to edit this object it is accessible in the onready callback js new vivus my div id file link to my svg onready function myvivus el property is the svg element myvivus el setattribute height auto check out the hacks page for more tricks constructor the vivus constructor asks for 3 parameters id or object of dom element to interact with it can be an inline svg or a wrapper element to append an object tag from the option file option object described in the following callback to call at the end of the animation optional option list name type description type string defines what kind of animation will be used delayed sync onebyone script scenario or scenario sync default delayed file string link to the svg to animate if set vivus will create an object tag and append it to the dom element given to the constructor be careful use the onready callback before playing with the vivus instance start string defines how to trigger the animation inviewport once the svg is in the viewport manual gives you the freedom to call draw method to start autostart makes it start right now default inviewport duration integer animation duration in frames default 200 delay integer time between the drawing of first and last path in frames only for delayed animations onready function function called when the instance is ready to play pathtimingfunction function timing animation function for each path element of the svg check the timing function part animtimingfunction function timing animation function for the complete svg check the timing function part dashgap integer whitespace extra margin between dashes increase it in case of glitches at the initial state of the animation default 2 forcerender boolean force the browser to re render all updated path items by default the value is true on ie only check the troubleshoot section for more details reversestack boolean reverse the order of execution the default behaviour is to render from the first path in the svg to the last one this option allow you to reverse the order default false selfdestroy boolean removes all extra styling on the svg and leaves it as original methods name description play speed callback plays the animation with the speed given in parameter this value can be negative to go backward between 0 and 1 to go slowly 1 to go faster or 0 to go in reverse from current state default 1 callback executed after the animation is finished optional stop stops the animation reset reinitialises the svg to the original state undrawn finish set the svg to the final state drawn setframeprogress progress set the progress of the animation progress must be a number between 0 and 1 getstatus get the status of the animation between start progress end destroy reset the svg but make the instance out of order these methods return the object so you can chain the actions js const myvivus new vivus my svg id myvivus stop reset play 2 play method callback instead of using the global constructor callback when you create the vivus object you can add callbacks to be executed for specific play method calls js const myvivus new vivus my svg id myvivus play 1 function called after the animation completes alternativly if you leave the speed param blank and use the default you can pass the callback as the first parameter like so myvivus play function called after the animation completes timing function to give more freedom its possible to override the animation of each path and or the entire svg it works a bit like the css animation timing function but instead of using a cubic bezier function it use a simple javascript function it must accept a number as parameter between 0 to 1 then return a number also between 0 and 1 its a hook if you dont want to create your own timing methods are available via the constructor object ease ease in ease out and ease out bounce then set it in the option object to enjoy them js here the ease animation will be use for the global drawing new vivus my svg id type delayed duration 200 animtimingfunction vivus ease mycallback warning animtimingfunction is called at every frame of the animation and pathtimingfunction is also called at every frame for each path of your svg so be careful about them keep it simple or it can affect the performance extra attributes the attribute data ignore allows you to ignore path tags from the vivus animation html svg id my svg path path data ignore true path svg in this case the second path wont be part of the animation scenarize this feature allows you to script the animation of your svg for this the custom values will be set directly in the dom of the svg scenario this type is easier to understand but longer to implement you just have to define the start and duration of each element with data start and data duration attributes if it is missing it will use the default value given to the constructor the best part of this type is the flexibility it provides you dont have to respect the order stack of the svg and you can start with the last element then continue with the first to finish with all the rest at the same time you will then have to define custom rules for each element in your svg via extra attributes in your svg dom data start integer time when the animation must start in frames data duration integer animation duration of this path in frames html svg path data start 0 data duration 10 path data start 20 data duration 10 path data start 20 data duration 20 path data start 0 data duration 30 svg scenario sync its not the sexiest code ever but its quite flexible in addition to this the behaviour is fairly different by using this animation type the default behaviour is the same as onebyone however you can define some properties on a specific path item such as the duration the delay to start from the end of the previous path and if it should be played synchronously data delay integer time between the end of the animation of the previous path and the start of the current path in frames data duration integer duration of this path animation in frames data async no value required make the drawing of this path asynchronous it means the next path will start at the same time if a path does not have an attribute for duration or delay then the default values set in the options will be used example here is a simple svg containing 5 elements with the following options duration 20 delay 0 we should get this timeline this looks like onebyone animation synchronous mode but to make it a bit custom here is what i can do html svg path data duration 10 path data delay 10 data async path data delay 15 path data duration 10 data delay 45 data async path data duration 50 data delay 5 svg this scenario should give us im sorry if it does not look very sexy and its not really easy to use im happy to make any changes as long as the idea sounds interesting post an issue and ill be very happy to talk about it development to make it simpler a gulp file is set up to automise minifying jshint and tests if you have never used gulp before this is a good opportunity to use it you need to install nodejs first then run sudo npm install g gulp to start you will need to install the repo dependencies bash npm install then you can run gulp with one of the following tasks distrib make the build generate dist vivus js and dist vivus min js lint run jshint on the source files test run karma develop keep watching your files if any change is applied gulp will run the task s related to it troubleshoot internet explorer some svg werent working at all the only solution found was to clone and replace each updated path element of course this solution requires more resources and a lot of dom manipulation but it will give a smooth animation like other browsers this fallback is only applied on internet explorer all versions and can be disabled via the option forcerender replacing each updated path by a clone was the only way to force ie to re render the svg on some svgs this trick is not necessary but ie can be a bit tricky with this if youre worried about performance i would recommend checking if your svg works correctly by disabling the forcerender option if it works correctly on ie then keep it like this by default forcerender is true on internet explorer only firefox for firefox users you might encounter some glitches depending on your svg and browser version on versions before 36 there is a problem retrieving path length via gettotallength method returning 174321516544 instead of 209 im not exaggerating this comes from a real case messing up the entire animation treatment unfortunately theres nothing that this library can do this is due to firefox i hope to find a workaround but at the moment i can only recommend that you test your animation on previous versions of firefox debug for an easier debug have a look to the attribute map of your vivus object this contains the mapping of your animation if youre using a modern browser i recommend console table to get a nice output of the array which will make your debug easier javascript const logo new vivus mylogo type scenario sync the property map contain all the svg mapping console table logo map special thanks thanks to all contributors also users who pushed me to improve the library by publishing it on npm or browser compatibility or features also thanks for fixing my awful english jolic for dynamic svg
