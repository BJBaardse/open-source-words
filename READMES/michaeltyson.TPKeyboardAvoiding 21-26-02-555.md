tpkeyboardavoiding a drop in universal solution for moving text fields out of the way of the keyboard in ios introduction there are a hundred and one proposed solutions out there for how to move uitextfield and uitextview out of the way of the keyboard during editing usually it comes down to observing uikeyboardwillshownotification and uikeyboardwillhidenotification or implementing uitextfielddelegate delegate methods and adjusting the frame of the superview or using uitableviews scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated but most proposed solutions tend to be quite diy and have to be implemented for each view controller that needs it this is a relatively universal drop in solution uiscrollview and uitableview subclasses that handle everything when the keyboard is about to appear the subclass will find the subview thats about to be edited and adjust its frame and content offset to make sure that view is visible with an animation to match the keyboard pop up when the keyboard disappears it restores its prior size it should work with basically any setup either a uitableview based interface or one consisting of views placed manually it also automatically hooks up next buttons on the keyboard to switch through the text fields usage for use with uitableviewcontroller classes drop tpkeyboardavoidingtableview m and tpkeyboardavoidingtableview h into your project and make your uitableview a tpkeyboardavoidingtableview in the xib if youre not using a xib with your controller i know of no easy way to make its uitableview a custom class the path of least resistance is to create a xib for it for non uitableviewcontrollers drop the tpkeyboardavoidingscrollview m and tpkeyboardavoidingscrollview h source files into your project pop a uiscrollview into your view controllers xib set the scroll views class to tpkeyboardavoidingscrollview and put all your controls within that scroll view you can also create it programmatically without using a xib just use the tpkeyboardavoidingscrollview as your top level view to disable the automatic next button functionality change the uitextfields return key type to anything but uireturnkeydefault notes these classes currently adjust the contentinset parameter to avoid content moving beneath the keyboard this is done as opposed to adjusting the frame in order to work around an ios bug that results in a jerky animation where the view jumps upwards before settling down in order to facilitate this workaround the contentsize is maintained to be at least same size as the views frame licence zlib copyright c 2013 michael tyson this software is provided as is without any express or implied warranty in no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose including commercial applications and to alter it and redistribute it freely subject to the following restrictions the origin of this software must not be misrepresented you must not claim that you wrote the original software if you use this software in a product an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated but is not required altered source versions must be plainly marked as such and must not be misrepresented as being the original software this notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution michael tyson a tasty pixel michael atastypixel com
