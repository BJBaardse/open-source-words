fingerprintjs2 support library on patreon original fingerprintjs library was developed in 2012 its now impossible to evolve it without breaking backwards compatibilty so this project will be where all the new development happens this project will use significantly more sources for fingerprinting all of them will be configurable that is it should be possible to cherry pick only the options you need or just enable them all im also paying special attention to ie plugins popular in china such as qq baidu and others this project will not be backwards compatible with original fingerprintjs this project uses semver installation cdn cdn jsdelivr net npm fingerprintjs2 version dist fingerprint2 min js or https cdnjs com libraries fingerprintjs2 bower bower install fingerprintjs2 npm npm install fingerprintjs2 yarn yarn add fingerprintjs2 usage js new fingerprint2 get function result components console log result a hash representing your device fingerprint console log components an array of fp components note you should not run fingerprinting directly on or after page load rather delay it for a few milliseconds to ensure consistent fingerprints see 307 254 and others you can pass an object with options all of which are optional js var options swfpath assets fontlist swf excludeuseragent true new fingerprint2 options get function result console log result full list of options will be in the https github com valve fingerprintjs2 wiki list of options wiki page flash font enumeration is disabled by default js code is used by default to get the list of available fonts the reason for this is that flash will not work in incognito mode however you can make the library to use flash when detecting the fonts with js excludejsfonts true option to use flash font enumeration make sure you have swfobject available if you dont the library will skip the flash part entirely detectscreenorientation option is true by default to ensure consistent fingerprints when users rotate their mobile devices all fingerprinting sources are enabled by default i e you dont need to explicitly configure the library to include them js new fingerprint2 get function result components this will use all available fingerprinting sources console log result components is an array of all fingerprinting components used console log components userdefinedfonts option while hundreds of the most popular fonts are included in the extended font list you may wish to increase the entropy of the font fingerprint by specifying the userdefinedfonts option as an array of font names but make sure to call the fingerprint function after the page load and not before otherwise font detection might not work properly and in a result returned hash might be different every time you reloaded the page js new fingerprint2 userdefinedfonts nimbus mono junicode presto get function result components console log result preprocessor option function that is called with each component value that may be used to modify component values before computing the fingerprint for example strip browser version from user agent js new fingerprint2 preprocessor function key value if key user agent var parser new uaparser value https github com faisalman ua parser js var useragentminusversion parser getos name parser getbrowser name return useragentminusversion else return value get function result components user agent component will contain string processed with our function for example windows chrome console log result components view the fingerprint locally you can view your browser fingerprint locally by starting a webserver and viewing the index html page loading index html from the filesystem wont work due to flashs externalinterface security restrictions to start a web server you can try using one of the following ruby 1 9 2 ruby run e httpd p 8080 python 2 x python m simplehttpserver 8080 python 3 x python m http server 8080 php 5 4 php s 0 0 0 0 8080 list of fingerprinting sources useragent language color depth screen resolution timezone has session storage or not has local storage or not has indexed db has ie specific addbehavior has open db cpu class platform donottrack or not full list of installed fonts maintaining their order which increases the entropy implemented with flash a list of installed fonts detected with js css side channel technique can detect up to 500 installed fonts without flash canvas fingerprinting webgl fingerprinting plugins ie included is adblock installed or not has the user tampered with its languages 1 has the user tampered with its screen resolution 1 has the user tampered with its os 1 has the user tampered with its browser 1 touch screen detection and capabilities pixel ratio systems total number of logical processors available to the user agent device memory audio fingerprinting by default js font detection will only detect up to 65 installed fonts if you want to improve the font detection you can pass extendedjsfonts true option this will increase the number of detectable fonts to 500 on my machine mbp 2013 core i5 chrome 46 the default fp process takes about 80 100ms if you use extendedjsfonts option this time will increase up to 2000ms cold font cache this option can incur even more overhead on mobile firefox browsers which is much slower in font detection so use it with caution on mobile devices to speed up fingerprint computation you can exclude font detection 40ms canvas fingerprint 10ms webgl fingerprint 35 ms and audio fingerprint 30 ms many more fingerprinting sources will be implemented such as in no particular order multi monitor detection internal hashtable implementation detection webrtc fingerprinting math constants accessibility fingerprinting camera information drm support accelerometer support virtual keyboards list of supported gestures for touch enabled devices pixel density video and audio codecs availability audio stack fingerprinting to recompile the fontlist swf file download
