minikube buildstatus widget codecovwidget goreport widget what is minikube minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run kubernetes locally minikube runs a single node kubernetes cluster inside a vm on your laptop for users looking to try out kubernetes or develop with it day to day installation macos shell brew cask install minikube linux shell curl lo minikube https storage googleapis com minikube releases latest minikube linux amd64 chmod x minikube sudo mv minikube usr local bin windows download the minikube windows amd64 exe file rename it to minikube exe and add it to your path linux continuous integration without vm support example with kubectl installation shell curl lo minikube https storage googleapis com minikube releases latest minikube linux amd64 chmod x minikube curl lo kubectl https storage googleapis com kubernetes release release curl s https storage googleapis com kubernetes release release stable txt bin linux amd64 kubectl chmod x kubectl export minikube

kube config sudo e minikube start vm driver none this for loop waits until kubectl can access the api server that minikube has created for i in 1 150 do timeout for 5 minutes kubectl get po dev null if ne 1 then break fi sleep 2 done kubectl commands are now able to interact with minikube cluster other ways to install linux arch linux aur fedora centos red hat copr opensuse suse linux enterprise windows chocolatey minikube version management the asdf tool offers version management for a wide range of languages and tools on macos asdf is available via homebrew and can be installed with brew install asdf then the minikube plugin itself can be installed with asdf plugin add minikube a specific version of minikube can be installed with asdf install minikube version the tool allows you to switch versions for projects using a tool versions file inside the project an asdf plugin exists for kubectl as well we also released a debian package and windows installer on our releases page if you maintain a minikube package please feel free to add it here requirements kubectl macos hyperkit driver xhyve driver virtualbox or vmware fusion linux virtualbox or kvm note minikube also supports a vm driver none option that runs the kubernetes components on the host and not in a vm docker is required to use this driver but no hypervisor if you use vm driver none be sure to specify a bridge network for docker otherwise it might change between network restarts causing loss of connectivity to your cluster windows virtualbox or hyper v vt x amd v virtualization must be enabled in bios internet connection on first run quickstart heres a brief demo of minikube usage if you want to change the vm driver add the appropriate vm driver xxx flag to minikube start minikube supports the following drivers virtualbox vmwarefusion kvm2 kvm deprecated in favor of kvm2 hyperkit xhyve hyperv none linux only this driver can be used to run the kubernetes cluster components on the host instead of in a vm this can be useful for ci workloads which do not support nested virtualization shell minikube start starting local kubernetes v1 7 5 cluster starting vm ssh ing files into vm setting up certs starting cluster components connecting to cluster setting up kubeconfig kubectl is now configured to use the cluster kubectl run hello minikube image k8s gcr io echoserver 1 4 port 8080 deployment hello minikube created kubectl expose deployment hello minikube type nodeport service hello minikube exposed we have now launched an echoserver pod but we have to wait until the pod is up before curling accessing it via the exposed service to check whether the pod is up and running we can use the following kubectl get pod name ready status restarts age hello minikube 3383150820 vctvh 1 1 containercreating 0 3s we can see that the pod is still being created from the containercreating status kubectl get pod name ready status restarts age hello minikube 3383150820 vctvh 1 1 running 0 13s we can see that the pod is now running and we will now be able to curl it curl minikube service hello minikube url client values client address 192 168 99 1 command get real path kubectl delete service hello minikube service hello minikube deleted kubectl delete deployment hello minikube deployment hello minikube deleted minikube stop stopping local kubernetes cluster machine stopped interacting with your cluster kubectl the minikube start command creates a kubectl context called minikube this context contains the configuration to communicate with your minikube cluster minikube sets this context to default automatically but if you need to switch back to it in the future run kubectl config use context minikube or pass the context on each command like this kubectl get pods context minikube dashboard to access the kubernetes dashboard run this command in a shell after starting minikube to get the address shell minikube dashboard services to access a service exposed via a node port run this command in a shell after starting minikube to get the address shell minikube service n namespace url name design minikube uses libmachine for provisioning vms and localkube
