react redux universal hot example about this is a starter boilerplate app ive put together using the following technologies isomorphic universal rendering both client and server make calls to load data from separate api server react react router express babel for es6 and es7 magic webpack for bundling webpack dev middleware webpack hot middleware reduxs futuristic flux implementation redux dev tools for next generation dx developer experience watch dan abramovs talk react router redux redux react router bindings eslint to maintain a consistent code style redux form to manage form state in redux lru memoize to speed up form validation multireducer to combine single reducers into one key based reducer style loader sass loader and less loader to allow import of stylesheets in plain css sass and less bootstrap sass loader and font awesome webpack to customize bootstrap and fontawesome react helmet to manage title and meta tag information on both server and client webpack isomorphic tools to allow require work for statics both on client and server mocha to allow writing unit tests for the project i cobbled this together from a wide variety of similar starter repositories as i post this in june 2015 all of these libraries are right at the bleeding edge of web development they may fall out of fashion as quickly as they have come into it but i personally believe that this stack is the future of web development and will survive for several years im building my new projects like this and i recommend that you do too installation bash npm install running dev server bash npm run dev the first time it may take a little while to generate the first webpack assets json and complain with a few dozen webpack isomorphic tools waiting for the first webpack build to finish printouts but be patient give it 30 seconds using redux devtools redux devtools are enabled by default in development ctrl h toggle devtools dock ctrl q move devtools dock position see redux devtools dock monitor for more detailed information if you have the redux devtools chrome extension installed it will automatically be used on the client side instead if you want to disable the dev tools during development set devtools to false in webpack dev config js devtools are not enabled during production building and running production server bash npm run build npm run start demo a demonstration of this app can be seen running on heroku which is a deployment of the heroku branch documentation exploring the demo app is a guide that can be used before you install the kit installing the kit guides you through installation and running the development server locally adding text to the home page guides you through adding hello world to the home page adding a page guides you through adding a new page react tutorial converting reflux to redux by matt star if you are the kind of person that learns best by following along a tutorial i can recommend matt stars overview and examples explanation what initially gets run is bin server js which does little more than enable es6 and es7 awesomeness in the server side node code it then initiates server js in server js we proxy any requests to api to the api server running at localhost 3030 all the data fetching calls from the client go to api aside from serving the favicon and static content from static the only thing server js does is initiate delegate rendering to react router at the bottom of server js we listen to port 3000 and initiate the api server routing and html return the primary section of server js generates an html page with the contents returned by react router first we instantiate an apiclient a facade that both server and client code use to talk to the api server on the server side apiclient is given the request object so that it can pass along the session cookie to the api server to maintain session state we pass this api client facade to the redux middleware so that the action creators have access to it then we perform server side data fetching wait for the data to be loaded and render the page with the now fully loaded redux state the last interesting bit of the main routing section of server js is that we swap in the hashed script and css from the webpack assets json that the webpack dev server – or the webpack build process on production – has spit out on its last run you wont have to deal with webpack assets json manually because webpack isomorphic tools take care of that we also spit out the redux state into a global window data variable in the webpage to be loaded by the client side redux code server side data fetching the redux async connect package exposes an api to return promises that need to be fulfilled before a route is rendered it exposes a reduxasyncconnect container which wraps our render tree on both server and client more documentation is available on the redux async connect page client side the client side entry point is reasonably named client js all it does is load the routes initiate react router rehydrate the redux state from the window data passed in from the server and render the page over top of the server rendered dom this makes react enable all its event listeners without having to re render the dom redux middleware the middleware clientmiddleware js serves two functions to allow the action creators access to the client api facade remember this is the same on both the client and the server and cannot simply be imported because it holds the cookie needed to maintain session on server to server requests to allow some actions to pass a promise generator a function that takes the api client and returns a promise such actions require three action types the request action that initiates the data loading and a success and failure action that will be fired depending on the result of the promise there are other ways to accomplish this some discussed here which you may prefer but to the author of this example the middleware way feels cleanest redux modules what the duck the src redux modules folder contains modules to help isolate concerns within a redux application aka ducks a redux style proposal that i came up with i encourage you to read the ducks docs and provide feedback api server this is where the meat of your server side application goes it doesnt have to be implemented in node or express at all this is where you connect to your database and provide authentication and session management in this example its just spitting out some json with the current time stamp getting data and actions into components to understand how the data and action bindings get into the components – theres only one infobar in this example – im going to refer to you to the redux library the only innovation ive made is to package the component and its wrapper in the same js file this is to encapsulate the fact that the component is bound to the redux actions and state the component using infobar neednt know or care if infobar uses the redux data or not images now its possible to render the image both on client and server please refer to issue 39 for more detail discussion the usage would be like below super easy javascript let logoimage require logo png styles this project uses local styles using css loader the way it works is that you import your stylesheet at the top of the render function in your react component and then you use the classnames returned from that import like so javascript render const styles require app scss then you set the classname of your element to match one of the css classes in your scss file and youre good to go jsx div classname styles mysection div alternative to local styles if youd like to use plain inline styles this is possible with a few modifications to your webpack configuration 1 configure isomorphic tools to accept css in webpack isomorphic tools js add css to the list of style module extensions javascript style modules extensions less scss css 2 add a css loader to webpack dev config in dev config js modify module loaders to include a test and loader for css javascript module loaders test \ css loader style loader css loader 3 add a css loader to the webpack prod config you must use the extracttextplugin in this loader in prod config js modify module loaders to include a test and loader for css javascript module loaders test \ css loader extracttextplugin extract style loader css loader now you may simply omit assigning the required stylesheet to a variable and keep it at the top of your render function javascript render require app css require amodule dist style css note in order to use this method with scss or less files one more modification must be made in both dev config js and prod config js in the loaders for less and scss files remove modules localidentname before javascript test \ less loader style css modules importloaders 2 sourcemap localidentname local hash base64 5 autoprefixer browsers last 2 version less outputstyle expanded sourcemap after javascript test \ less loader style css importloaders 2 sourcemap autoprefixer browsers last 2 version less outputstyle expanded sourcemap after this modification to both loaders you will be able to use scss and less files in the same way as css files unit tests the project uses mocha to run your unit tests it uses karma as the test runner it enables the feature that you are able to render your tests to the browser e g firefox chrome etc which means you are able to use the test utilities from facebook api like renderintodocument to run the tests in the project just simply run npm test if you have chrome installed it will be automatically launched as a test service for you to keep watching your test suites that you are working on just set singlerun false in the karma conf js file please be sure set it to true if you are running npm test on a continuous integration server travis ci etc deployment on heroku to get this project to work on heroku you need to remove the port 8080 line from the betterscripts start prod section of package json heroku config set node env production heroku config set node path src heroku config set npm config production false this is to enable webpack to run the build on deploy the first deploy might take a while but after that your node modules dir should be cached faq this project moves fast and has an active community so if you have a question that is not answered below please visit our discord channel or file an issue roadmap although this isnt a library we recently started versioning to make it easier to track breaking changes and emerging best practices inline styles css is dead contributing i am more than happy to accept external contributions to the project in the form of feedback bug reports and even better pull requests if you would like to submit a pull request please make an effort to follow the guide in contributing md thanks for checking this out – erik rasmussen
