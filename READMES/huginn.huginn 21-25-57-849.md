what is huginn huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online they can read the web watch for events and take actions on your behalf huginns agents create and consume events propagating them along a directed graph think of it as a hackable version of ifttt or zapier on your own server you always know who has your data you do here are some of the things that you can do with huginn track the weather and get an email when its going to rain or snow tomorrow dont forget your umbrella list terms that you care about and receive emails when their occurrence on twitter changes for example want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of machine learning huginn will watch the term machine learning on twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion watch for air travel or shopping deals follow your project names on twitter and get updates when people mention them scrape websites and receive emails when they change connect to adioso hipchat basecamp growl ftp imap jabber jira mqtt nextbus pushbullet pushover rss bash slack stubhub translation apis twilio twitter wunderground and weibo to name a few send digest emails with things that you care about at specific times during the day track counts of high frequency events and send an sms within moments when they spike such as the term san francisco emergency send and receive webhooks run custom javascript or coffeescript functions track your location over time create amazon mechanical turk workflows as the inputs or outputs of agents the amazon turk agent is called the humantaskagent for example once a day ask 5 people for a funny cat photo send the results to 5 more people to be rated send the top rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption finally post the best captioned photo on my blog join us in our gitter room to discuss the project join us want to help with huginn all contributions are encouraged you could make ui improvements add new agents write documentation and tutorials or try tackling issues tagged with help wanted please fork add specs and send pull requests really want a fix or feature want to solve some community issues and earn some extra coffee money take a look at the current bounties on bountysource have an awesome idea but not feeling quite up to contributing yet head over to our official suggest an agent thread and tell us examples please checkout the huginn introductory screencast and now some example screenshots below them are instructions to get you started getting started docker the quickest and easiest way to check out huginn is to use the official docker image have a look at the documentation local installation if you just want to play around you can simply fork this repository then perform the following steps run git remote add upstream https github com huginn huginn git to add the main repository as a remote for your fork copy env example to env cp env example env and edit env at least updating the app secret token variable make sure that you have mysql or postgresql installed on a mac the easiest way is with homebrew if youre going to use postgresql youll need to prepend all commands below with database adapter postgresql run bundle to install dependencies run bundle exec rake db create bundle exec rake db migrate and then bundle exec rake db seed to create a development database with some example agents run bundle exec foreman start visit http localhost 3000 and login with the username of admin and the password of password setup some agents read the wiki for usage examples and to get started making new agents periodically run git fetch upstream and then git checkout master git merge upstream master to merge in the newest version of huginn note by default emails are intercepted in the development rails environment which is what you just setup you can view them at http localhost 3000 letter opener if youd like to send real emails via smtp when playing with huginn locally set send email in development to true in your env file if you need more detailed instructions see the novice setup guide develop all agents have specs and theres also acceptance tests that simulate running huginn in a headless browser install phantomjs 2 1 1 or greater using node package manager npm install phantomjs using homebrew on osx brew install phantomjs run all specs with bundle exec rspec run a specific spec with bundle exec rspec path to specific test spec rb read more about rspec for rails here using huginn agent gems huginn agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your huginn installation with the additional gems environment variable see the additional agent gems section of env example for more information if youd like to write your own huginn agent gem please see huginn agent our general intention is to encourage complex and specific agents to be written as gems while continuing to add new general purpose agents to the core huginn repository deployment please see the huginn wiki for detailed deployment strategies for different providers heroku try huginn on heroku takes a few minutes to setup read the documentation while you are waiting and be sure to click view it after launch huginn launches on the free version of heroku with significant limitations for non experimental use we strongly recommend herokus 1gb paid plan or our docker container openshift online v3 try huginn on openshift online v3 oc new app f https raw githubusercontent com huginn huginn master openshift templates huginn mysql json or oc new app f https raw githubusercontent com huginn huginn master openshift templates huginn postgresql json you can also use the web console to import either json file by going to add to project import yaml json if you are on the starter plan make sure to follow the guide to remove any existing application manual installation on any server have a look at the installation guide optional setup setup for private development see private development instructions on the wiki enable the weatheragent in order to use the weatheragent you need an api key with wunderground signup for one and then change the value of api key your key in your seeded weatheragent note wunderground no longer offers free api keys you can still use the weatheragent by setting the service key to darksky and getting an api key from darksky disable ssl we assume your deployment will run over ssl this is a very good idea however if you wish to turn this off youll probably need to edit config initializers devise rb and modify the line containing config rememberable options secure true you will also need to edit config environments production rb and modify the value of config force ssl license huginn is provided under the mit license huginn was originally created by cantino in 2013 since then many peoples dedicated contributions have made it what it is today
