fabric chat support build coverage status climate npm bower cdnjs versions downloads deps status bounties tips fabric js is a framework that makes it easy to work with html5 canvas element it is an interactive object model on top of canvas element it is also an svg to canvas parser using fabric js you can create and populate objects on canvas objects like simple geometrical shapes — rectangles circles ellipses polygons or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of simple paths you can then scale move and rotate these objects with the mouse modify their properties — color transparency z index etc you can also manipulate these objects altogether — grouping them with a simple mouse selection non technical introduction to fabric fabric js allows you to easily create simple shapes like rectangles circles triangles and other polygons or more complex shapes made up of many paths onto the html canvas element on a webpage using javascript fabric js will then allow you to manipulate the size position and rotation of these objects with a mouse its also possible to change some of the attributes of these objects such as their color transparency depth position on the webpage or selecting groups of these objects using the fabric js library fabric js will also allow you to convert an svg image into javascript data that can be used for putting it onto the canvas element contributions are very much welcome goals unit tested 4800 assertion 1050 tests at the moment 76 coverage modular 60 small classes modules mixins cross browser fast encapsulated in one object no browser sniffing for critical functionality runs under es5 strict mode runs on a server under node js stable releases and latest of current see node js limitations follows semantic versioning supported browsers firefox 2 safari 3 opera 9 64 chrome all versions ie10 ie11 edge you can run automated unit tests right in the browser history fabric js started as a foundation for design editor on printio ru — interactive online store with ability to create your own designs the idea was to create javascript based editor which would make it easy to manipulate vector shapes and images on t shirts since performance was one of the most critical requirements we chose canvas over svg while svg is excellent with static shapes its not as performant as canvas when it comes to dynamic manipulation of objects movement scaling rotation etc fabric js was heavily inspired by ernest delgados canvas experiment in fact code from ernests experiment was the foundation of an entire framework later fabric js grew into a collection of distinct object types and got an svg to canvas parser install with bower bower install fabric install with npm to install fabric js using npm you must first manually install cairo on your system cairo is a system library which powers node canvas which fabric js relies on when the installation is complete you may need to restart your terminal or command prompt before installing fabric npm install fabric save building install node js build distribution file 77k minified 20k gzipped node build js 2 1 or build a custom distribution file by passing comma separated module names to be included node build js modules text serialization parser or node build js modules text or node build js modules parser text etc by default when none of the modules are specified only basic functionality is included see the list of modules below for more information on each one of them note that default distribution has support for static canvases only to get minimal distribution with interactivity make sure to include corresponding module node build js modules interaction 2 2 you can also include all modules like so node build js modules all 2 3 you can exclude a few modules like so node build js modules all exclude gestures image filters create a minified distribution file using yuicompressor default option node build js modules minifier yui or google closure compiler node build js modules minifier closure enable amd support via require js requires uglify node build js requirejs modules create source map file for better productive debugging requires uglify or google closure compiler more information about source maps node build js sourcemap modules if you use google closure compiler you have to add sourcemappingurl manually at the end of the minified file all min js see issue https code google com p closure compiler issues detail id 941 sourcemappingurl fabric min js map ensure code guidelines are met prerequisite npm g install eslint npm run lint npm run lint tests testing install node js install npm if necessary install npm packages npm install run test suite make sure testem is installed npm install g testem run tests chrome and node by default testem see testem docs for more info https github com testem testem demos demos kitchensink demo benchmarks whos using fabric documentation documentation is always available at http fabricjs com docs also see official 4 part intro series presentation from bk js and presentation from falsy values for an overview of fabric js how it works and its features optional modules these are the optional modules that could be specified for inclusion when building custom version of fabric text — adds support for static text fabric text itext — adds support for interactive text fabric itext fabric textbox serialization — adds support for loadfromjson loadfromdatalessjson and clone methods on fabric canvas interaction — adds support for interactive features of fabric — selecting transforming objects groups via mouse touch devices parser — adds support for fabric parsesvgdocument fabric loadsvgfromurl and fabric loadsvgfromstring image filters — adds support for image filters such as grayscale of white removal easing — adds support for animation easing functions node — adds support for running fabric under node js with help of jsdom and node canvas libraries freedrawing — adds support for free drawing gestures — adds support for multitouch gestures with help of event js object straightening — adds support for rotating an object to one of 0 90 180 270 etc depending on which is angle is closer animation — adds support for animation fabric util animate fabric util requestanimframe fabric object animate fabric canvas fxcenterobjecth fxcenterobjectv fxremove additional flags for build script are requirejs — makes fabric requirejs amd compatible in dist fabric js note an unminified requirejs compatible version is always created in dist fabric require js no strict — strips use strict directives from source no svg export — removes svg exporting functionality sourcemap generates a sourcemap file and adds the sourcemappingurl only if uglifyjs is used to dist fabric min js for example node build js modules all exclude json no strict no svg export examples of use adding red rectangle to canvas html doctype html script src lib fabric js script script var canvas new
