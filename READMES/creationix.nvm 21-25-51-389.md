installation install script to install or update nvm you can use the install script using curl sh curl o https raw githubusercontent com creationix nvm v0 33 11 install sh bash or wget sh wget qo https raw githubusercontent com creationix nvm v0 33 11 install sh bash the script clones the nvm repository to nvm and adds the source line to your profile bash profile zshrc profile or bashrc sh export nvm dir home nvm s nvm dir nvm sh \ nvm dir nvm sh this loads nvm note you can add no use to the end of the above script nvm sh no use to postpone using nvm until you manually use it you can customize the install source directory profile and version using the nvm source nvm dir profile and node version variables eg curl nvm dir path to nvm ensure that the nvm dir does not contain a trailing slash nb the installer can use git curl or wget to download nvm whatever is available note on linux after running the install script if you get nvm command not found or see no feedback from your terminal after you type sh command v nvm simply close your current terminal open a new terminal and try verifying again note since os x 10 9 usr bin git has been preset by xcode command line tools which means we cant properly detect if git is installed or not you need to manually install the xcode command line tools before running the install script otherwise itll fail see 1782 note on os x if you get nvm command not found after running the install script one of the following might be the reason your system may not have a bash profile file where the command is set up simply create one with touch bash profile and run the install script again you might need to restart your terminal instance try opening a new tab window in your terminal and retry if the above doesnt fix the problem open your bash profile and add the following line of code source bashrc for more information about this issue and possible workarounds please refer here verify installation to verify that nvm has been installed do sh command v nvm which should output nvm if the installation was successful please note that which nvm will not work since nvm is a sourced shell function not an executable binary important notes if youre running a system without prepackaged binary available which means youre going to install nodejs or io js from its source code you need to make sure your system has a c compiler for os x xcode will work for debian ubuntu based gnu linux the build essential and libssl dev packages work note nvm does not support windows see 284 two alternatives exist which are neither supported nor developed by us nvm windows nodist note nvm does not support fish either see 303 alternatives exist which are neither supported nor developed by us bass allows you to use utilities written for bash in fish shell fast nvm fish only works with version numbers not aliases but doesnt significantly slow your shell startup plugin nvm plugin for oh my fish which makes nvm and its completions available in fish shell fnm fisherman based version manager for fish note we still have some problems with freebsd because there is no official pre built binary for freebsd and building from source may need patches see the issue ticket 900 bug nodejs on freebsd may need to be patched https github com creationix nvm issues 900 nodejs node 3716 note on os x if you do not have xcode installed and you do not wish to download the 4 3gb file you can install the command line tools you can check out this blog post on how to just that how to install command line tools in os x mavericks yosemite without xcode note on os x if you have had a system node installed and want to install modules globally keep in mind that when using nvm you do not need sudo to globally install a module with npm g so instead of doing sudo npm install g grunt do instead npm install g grunt if you have an npmrc file make sure it does not contain any prefix settings which is not compatible with nvm you can but should not keep your previous system node install but nvm will only be available to your user account the one used to install nvm this might cause version mismatches as other users will be using usr local lib node modules vs your user account using nvm versions node vx x x lib node modules homebrew installation is not supported if you have issues with homebrew installed nvm please brew uninstall it and install it using the instructions below before filing an issue note if youre using zsh you can easily install nvm as a zsh plugin install zsh nvm and run nvm upgrade to upgrade note git versions before v1 7 may face a problem of cloning nvm source from github via https protocol and there is also different behavior of git before v1 6 and git prior to v1 17 10 can not clone tags so the minimum required git version is v1 7 10 if you are interested in the problem we mentioned here please refer to githubs https cloning errors article git install if you have git installed requires git v1 7 10 clone this repo in the root of your user profile cd from anywhere then git clone https github com creationix nvm git nvm cd nvm and check out the latest version with git checkout v0 33 11 activate nvm by sourcing it from your shell nvm sh now add these lines to your bashrc profile or zshrc file to have it automatically sourced upon login you may have to add to more than one of the above files sh export nvm dir home nvm s nvm dir nvm sh \ nvm dir nvm sh this loads nvm s nvm dir bash completion \ nvm dir bash completion this loads nvm bash completion manual install for a fully

shell just use the installed version sh nvm use node or you can just run it sh nvm run node version or you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node sh nvm exec 4 2 node version you can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed sh nvm which 5 0 in place of a version pointer like 0 10 or 5 0 or 4 2 1 you can use the following special default aliases with nvm install nvm use nvm run nvm exec nvm which etc node this installs the latest version of node iojs this installs the latest version of io js stable this alias is deprecated and only truly applies to node v0 12 and earlier currently this is an alias for node unstable this alias points to node v0 11 the last unstable node release since post 1 0 all node versions are stable in semver versions communicate breakage not stability long term support node has a schedule for long term support lts you can reference lts versions in aliases and nvmrc files with the notation lts for the latest lts and lts argon for lts releases from the argon line for example in addition the following commands support lts arguments nvm install lts nvm install lts argon nvm install lts nvm install lts argon nvm uninstall lts nvm uninstall lts argon nvm uninstall lts nvm uninstall lts argon nvm use lts nvm use lts argon nvm use lts nvm use lts argon nvm exec lts nvm exec lts argon nvm exec lts nvm exec lts argon nvm run lts nvm run lts argon nvm run lts nvm run lts argon nvm ls remote lts nvm ls remote lts argon nvm ls remote lts nvm ls remote lts argon nvm version remote lts nvm version remote lts argon nvm version remote lts nvm version remote lts argon any time your local copy of nvm connects to https nodejs org it will re create the appropriate local aliases for all available lts lines these aliases stored under nvm dir alias lts are managed by nvm and you should not modify remove or create these files expect your changes to be undone and expect meddling with these files to cause bugs that will likely not be supported migrating global packages while installing if you want to install a new version of node js and migrate npm packages from a previous version sh nvm install node reinstall packages from node this will first use nvm version node to identify the current version youre migrating packages from then it resolves the new version to install from the remote server and installs it lastly it runs nvm reinstall packages to reinstall the npm packages from your prior version of node to the new one you can also install and migrate npm packages from specific versions of node like this sh nvm install 6 reinstall packages from 5 nvm install v4 2 reinstall packages from iojs default global packages from file while installing if you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version we support that too you can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line sh nvm dir default packages rimraf object inspect 1 0 2 stevemao left pad io js if you want to install io js sh nvm install iojs if you want to install a new version of io js and migrate npm packages from a previous version sh nvm install iojs reinstall packages from iojs the same guidelines mentioned for migrating npm packages in node js are applicable to io js system version of node if you want to use the system installed version of node you can use the special default alias system sh nvm use system nvm run system version listing versions if you want to see what versions are installed sh nvm ls if you want to see what versions are available to install sh nvm ls remote to restore your path you can deactivate it sh nvm deactivate to set a default node version to be used in any new shell use the alias default sh nvm alias default node to use a mirror of the node binaries set nvm nodejs org mirror sh export nvm nodejs org mirror https nodejs org dist nvm install node nvm nodejs org mirror https nodejs org dist nvm install 4 2 to use a mirror of the io js binaries set nvm iojs org mirror sh export nvm iojs org mirror https iojs org dist nvm install iojs v1 0 3 nvm iojs org mirror https iojs org dist nvm install iojs v1 0 3 nvm use will not by default create a current symlink set nvm symlink current to true to enable this behavior which is sometimes useful for ides note that using nvm in multiple shell tabs with this environment variable enabled can cause race conditions nvmrc you can create a nvmrc file containing a node version number or any other string that nvm understands see nvm help for details in the project root directory or any parent directory afterwards nvm use nvm install nvm exec nvm run and nvm which will use the version specified in the nvmrc file if no version is supplied on the command line for example to make nvm default to the latest 5 9 release the latest lts version or the latest node version for the current directory sh echo 5 9 nvmrc echo lts nvmrc to default to the latest lts version echo node nvmrc to default to the latest version then when you run nvm sh nvm use found path to project nvmrc with version 5 9 now using node v5 9 1 npm v3 7 3 nvm use et al will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the nvmrc file in other words running nvm use et al in any subdirectory of a directory with an nvmrc will result in that nvmrc being utilized the contents of a nvmrc file must be the version as described by nvm help followed by a newline no trailing spaces are allowed and the trailing newline is required deeper shell integration you can use avn to deeply integrate into your shell and automatically invoke nvm when changing directories avn is not supported by the nvm development team please report issues to the avn team if you prefer a lighter weight solution the recipes below have been contributed by nvm users they are not supported by the nvm development team we are however accepting pull requests for more examples zsh calling nvm use automatically in a directory with a nvmrc file put this into your home zshrc to call nvm use automatically whenever you enter a directory that contains an nvmrc file with a string telling nvm which node to use zsh place this after nvm initialization autoload u add zsh hook load nvmrc local node version nvm version local nvmrc path nvm find nvmrc if n nvmrc path then

in order to provide the best performance and other optimisations nvm will download and install pre compiled binaries for node and npm when you run nvm install x the node project compiles tests and hosts provides pre these compiled binaries which are built for mainstream traditional linux distributions such as debian ubuntu centos redhat et al alpine linux unlike mainstream traditional linux distributions is based on busybox a very compact 5mb linux distribution busybox and thus alpine linux uses a different c c stack to most mainstream traditional linux distributions musl this makes binary programs built for such mainstream traditional incompatible with alpine linux thus we cannot simply nvm install x on alpine linux and expect the downloaded binary to run correctly youll likely see does not exist errors if you try that there is a s flag for nvm install which requests nvm download node source and compile it locally if installing nvm on alpine linux is still what you want or need to do you should be able to achieve this by running the following from you alpine linux shell sh apk add u curl bash ca certificates openssl ncurses coreutils python2 make gcc g libgcc linux headers grep util linux binutils findutils curl o https raw githubusercontent com creationix nvm v0 33 11 install sh bash the node project has some desire but no concrete plans due to the overheads of building testing and support to offer alpine compatible binaries as a potential alternative mhart a node contributor has some docker images for alpine linux with node and optionally npm pre installed
