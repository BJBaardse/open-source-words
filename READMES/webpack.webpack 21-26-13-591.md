main purpose is to bundle javascript files for usage in a browser yet it is also capable of transforming bundling or packaging just about any resource or asset install install with npm bash npm install save dev webpack install with yarn bash yarn add webpack dev introduction this readme reflects webpack v2 x and v3 x the webpack v1 x documentation has been deprecated and deleted webpack is a bundler for modules the main purpose is to bundle javascript files for usage in a browser yet it is also capable of transforming bundling or packaging just about any resource or asset tl dr bundles es modules commonjs and amd modules even combined can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime to reduce initial loading time dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size loaders can preprocess files while compiling e g typescript to javascript handlebars strings to compiled functions images to base64 etc highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires get started check out webpacks quick get started guide and the other guides browser compatibility webpack supports all browsers that are es5 compliant ie8 and below are not supported webpack also needs promise for import and require ensure if you want to support older browsers you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions concepts plugins webpack has a rich plugin interface most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface this makes webpack very flexible name status install size description extract text webpack plugin extract npm extract size extracts text css from your bundles into a separate file app bundle css compression webpack plugin compression npm compression size prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with content encoding i18n webpack plugin i18n npm i18n size adds i18n support to your bundles html webpack plugin html plugin npm html plugin size simplifies creation of html files index html to serve your bundles loaders webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files this allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond javascript you can easily write your own loaders using node js loaders are activated by using loadername prefixes in require statements or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration files name status install size description raw loader raw npm raw size loads raw content of a file utf 8 val loader val npm val size executes code as module and considers exports as js code url loader url npm url size works like the file loader but can return a data url if the file is smaller than a limit file loader file npm file size emits the file into the output folder and returns the relative url json name status install size description json npm json size loads a json file included by default json5 npm json5 size loads and transpiles a json 5 file cson npm cson size loads and transpiles a cson file transpiling name status install size description script script npm script size executes a javascript file once in global context like in script tag require s are not parsed babel npm babel size loads es2015 code and transpiles to es5 using babel traceur npm traceur size loads es2015 code and transpiles to es5 using traceur type npm type size loads typescript like javascript awesome typescript loader awesome typescript npm awesome typescript size awesome typescript loader for webpack coffee npm coffee size loads coffeescript like javascript templating name status install size description html npm html

components like first class modules angular npm angular size loads and compiles angular 2 components riot npm riot size riot official webpack loader performance webpack uses async i o and has multiple caching levels this makes webpack fast and incredibly fast on incremental compilations module formats webpack supports es2015 commonjs and amd modules out of the box it performs clever static analysis on the ast of your code it even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions this allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box code splitting webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime this reduces the initial loading time optimizations webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your javascript by deduplicating frequently used modules minifying and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting it can also make your code chunks cache friendly by using hashes contributing we want contributing to webpack to be fun enjoyable and educational for anyone and everyone we have a vibrant ecosystem that spans beyond this single repo we welcome you to check out any of the repositories in our organization or webpack contrib organization which houses all of our loaders and plugins contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including documentation updates enhancements designs or bugfixes spelling or grammar fixes readme md corrections or redesigns adding unit or functional tests triaging github issues especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible searching webpack on twitter and helping someone else who needs help teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpacks repos blogging speaking about or creating tutorials about one of webpacks many features helping others in our webpack gitter channel if you are worried or dont know where to start you can always reach out to sean larkin thelarkinn on twitter or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance we have also started a series on our medium publication called the contributors guide to webpack we welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help looking to speak about webpack wed love to review your talk abstract cfp you can email it to webpack at opencollective dot com and we can give pointers or tips creating your own plugins and loaders if you create a loader or plugin we would 3 for you to open source it and put it on npm we follow the x loader x webpack plugin naming convention support we consider webpack to be a low level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools because of its flexibility webpack isnt always the easiest entry level solution however we do believe it is the most powerful that said were always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality if you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this were all ears if youre just getting started take a look at our new docs and concepts page this has a high level overview that is great for beginners looking for webpack 1 docs please check out the old wiki but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported if you want to discuss something or just need help here is our gitter room where there are always individuals looking to help out if you are still having difficulty we would love for you to post a question to stackoverflow with the webpack tag it is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack config js and relevant files so if you can provide them wed be extremely grateful and more likely to help you find the answer if you are twitter savvy you can tweet webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also if you have discovered a üêú or have a feature suggestion feel free to create an issue on github license core team tobias koppers core founder of webpack johannes ewald loaders plugins early adopter of webpack sean t larkin public relations founder of the core team kees kluskens development sponsor sponsoring most of the core team members webpack contributors and contributors in the ecosystem do this open source work in their free time if you use webpack for a serious task and youd like us to invest more time on it please donate this project increases your income productivity too it makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth this is how we use the donations allow the core team to work on webpack thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users support projects that are voted most work in progress infrastructure cost fees for money handling premium partners other backers and sponsors before we started using opencollective donations were made anonymously now that we have made the switch we would like to acknowledge these sponsors and the

site thanks to in chronological order google for google web toolkit gwt which aims to compile java to javascript it features a similar code splitting as webpack medikoo for modules webmake which is a similar project webpack was born because i wanted code splitting for modules webmake interestingly the code splitting issue is still open thanks also to phoscur for the discussion substack for browserify which is a similar project and source for many ideas jrburke for require js which is a similar project and source for many ideas defunctzombie for the browser field spec which makes modules available for node js browserify and webpack every early webpack user which contributed to webpack by writing issues or prs you influenced the direction shama jhnns and sokra for maintaining this project everyone who has written a loader for webpack you are the ecosystem everyone i forgot to mention here but also influenced webpack
