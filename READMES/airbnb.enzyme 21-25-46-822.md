enzyme enzyme is a javascript testing utility for react that makes it easier to assert manipulate and traverse your react components output enzymes api is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jquerys api for dom manipulation and traversal upgrading from enzyme 2 x or react 16 are you here to check whether or not enzyme is compatible with react 16 are you currently using enzyme 2 x great check out our migration guide for help moving on to enzyme v3 where react 16 is supported installation to get started with enzyme you can simply install it via npm you will need to install enzyme along with an adapter corresponding to the version of react or other ui component library you are using for instance if you are using enzyme with react 16 you can run bash npm i save dev enzyme enzyme adapter react 16 each adapter may have additional peer dependencies which you will need to install as well for instance enzyme adapter react 16 has peer dependencies on react and react dom at the moment enzyme has adapters that provide compatibility with react 16 x react 15 x react 0 14 x and react 0 13 x the following adapters are officially provided by enzyme and have the following compatibility with react enzyme adapter package react semver compatibility enzyme adapter react 16 16 0 0 enzyme adapter react 15 15 5 0 enzyme adapter react 15 4 15 0 0 0 15 4 x enzyme adapter react 14 0 14 0 enzyme adapter react 13 0 13 0 finally you need to configure enzyme to use the adapter you want it to use to do this you can use the top level configure api js import enzyme from enzyme import adapter from enzyme adapter react 16 enzyme configure adapter new adapter 3rd party adapters it is possible for the community to create additional non official adapters that will make enzyme work with other libraries if you have made one and its not included in the list below feel free to make a pr to this readme and add a link to it the known 3rd party adapters are adapter package for library status preact enzyme adapter preact work in progress enzyme adapter inferno inferno work in progress running enzyme tests enzyme is unopinionated regarding which test runner or assertion library you use and should be compatible with all major test runners and assertion libraries out there the documentation and examples for enzyme use mocha and chai but you should be able to extrapolate to your framework of choice if you are interested in using enzyme with custom assertions and convenience functions for testing your react components you can consider using chai enzyme with mocha chai jasmine enzyme with jasmine jest enzyme with jest should enzyme for should js expect enzyme for expect using enzyme with mocha using enzyme with karma using enzyme with browserify using enzyme with systemjs using enzyme with webpack using enzyme with jsdom using enzyme with react native using enzyme with jest using enzyme with lab using enzyme with tape and ava basic usage shallow rendering javascript import react from react import expect from chai import shallow from enzyme import sinon from sinon import mycomponent from mycomponent import foo from foo describe it renders three components const wrapper shallow expect wrapper find foo to have length 3 it renders an icon star const wrapper shallow expect wrapper find icon star to have length 1 it renders children when passed in const wrapper shallow expect wrapper contains to equal true it simulates click events const onbuttonclick sinon spy const wrapper shallow wrapper find button simulate click expect onbuttonclick to have property callcount 1 read the full api documentation full dom rendering javascript import react from react import sinon from sinon import expect from chai import mount from enzyme import foo from foo describe it allows us to set props const wrapper mount expect wrapper props bar to equal baz wrapper setprops bar foo expect wrapper props bar to equal foo it simulates click events const onbuttonclick sinon spy const wrapper mount wrapper find button simulate click expect onbuttonclick to have property callcount 1 it calls componentdidmount sinon spy foo prototype componentdidmount const wrapper mount expect foo prototype componentdidmount to have property callcount 1 foo prototype componentdidmount restore read the full api documentation static rendered markup javascript import react from react import expect from chai import render from enzyme import foo from foo describe it renders three foo bars const wrapper render expect wrapper find foo bar length to equal 3 it renders the title const wrapper render expect wrapper text to contain unique read the full api documentation future enzyme future contributing see the contributors guide in the wild organizations and projects using enzyme can list themselves here license mit
