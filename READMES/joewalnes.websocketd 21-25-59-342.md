websocketd websocketd is a small command line tool that will wrap an existing command line interface program and allow it to be accessed via a websocket websocket capable applications can now be built very easily as long as you can write an executable program that reads stdin and writes to stdout you can build a websocket server do it in python ruby perl bash net c go php java clojure scala groovy expect awk vbscript haskell lua r whatever no networking libraries necessary joewalnes details upon startup websocketd will start a websocket server on a specified port and listen for connections upon a connection it will fork the appropriate process and disconnect the process when the websocket connection closes and vice versa any message sent from the websocket client will be piped to the processs stdin stream followed by a \n newline any text printed by the process to stdout shall be sent as a websocket message whenever a \n newline is encountered download if youre on a mac you can install websocketd using homebrew just run brew install websocketd for other operating systems or if you dont want to use homebrew check out the link below download for linux os x and windows quickstart to get started well create a websocket endpoint that will accept connections then send back messages counting to 10 with 1 second pause between each one before disconnecting to show how simple it is lets do it in bash count sh sh bin bash for count 1 count 10 count do echo count sleep 1 done before turning it into a websocket server lets test it from the command line the beauty of websocketd is that servers work equally well in the command line or in shell scripts as they do in the server with no modifications required sh chmod x count sh count sh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 now lets turn it into a websocket server sh websocketd port 8080 count sh finally lets create a web page that to test it count html html doctype html helper function log message to screen function log msg document getelementbyid log textcontent msg \n p p setup websocket with callbacks var ws new websocket ws localhost 8080 ws onopen function log connect ws onclose function log disconnect ws onmessage function event log message event data open this page in your web browser it will even work if you open it directly from disk using afile url more features very simple install just download the single executable for linux mac or windows and run it minimal dependencies no installers no package managers no external libraries suitable for development and production servers server side scripts can access details about the websocket http request e g remote host query parameters cookies path etc via standard cgi environment variables as well as serving websocket daemons it also includes a static file server and classic cgi server for convenience command line help available via websocketd help includes websocket developer console to make it easy to test your scripts before youve built a javascript frontend examples in many programming languages are available to help you getting started user manual more documentation in the user manual example projects plot real time linux cpu io mem stats to a html5 dashboard using websocketd and vmstat for linux remote jscript vbscript code execution tool based on websocketd for windows arbitrary repl in the browser using websocketd got more examples open a pull request my other projects reconnectingwebsocket simplest way to add some robustness to your websocket connections smoothie charts javascript charts for streaming data visit the igloo lab to see and subscribe to other thingies i make and follow joewalnes
