jsdom jsdom is a pure javascript implementation of many web standards notably the whatwg dom and html standards for use with node js in general the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real world web applications the latest versions of jsdom require node js v6 or newer versions of jsdom below v10 still work with node js v4 but are unsupported as of v10 jsdom has a new api documented below the old api is still supported for now see its documentation for details basic usage js const jsdom require jsdom const jsdom jsdom to use jsdom you will primarily use the jsdom constructor which is a named export of the jsdom main module pass the constructor a string you will get back a jsdom object which has a number of useful properties notably window js const dom new jsdom doctype html p hello world p console log dom window document queryselector p textcontent hello world note that jsdom will parse the html you pass it just like a browser does including implied html head and body tags the resulting object is an instance of the jsdom class which contains a number of useful properties and methods besides window in general it can be used to act on the jsdom from the outside doing things that are not possible with the normal dom apis for simple cases where you dont need any of this functionality we recommend a coding pattern like js const window new jsdom or even const document new jsdom window full documentation on everything you can do with the jsdom class is below in the section jsdom object api customizing jsdom the jsdom constructor accepts a second parameter which can be used to customize your jsdom in the following ways simple options js const dom new jsdom url https example org referrer https example com contenttype text html useragent mellblomenator 9000 includenodelocations true url sets the value returned by window location document url and document documenturi and affects things like resolution of relative urls within the document and the same origin restrictions and referrer used while fetching subresources it defaults to about blank referrer just affects the value read from document referrer it defaults to no referrer which reflects as the empty string contenttype affects the value read from document contenttype and how the document is parsed as html or as xml values that are not text html or an xml mime type will throw it defaults to text html useragent affects the value read from navigator useragent as well as the user agent header sent while fetching subresources it defaults to mozilla 5 0 process platform applewebkit 537 36 khtml like gecko jsdom jsdomversion includenodelocations preserves the location info produced by the html parser allowing you to retrieve it with the nodelocation method described below it also ensures that line numbers reported in exception stack traces for code running inside script elements are correct it defaults to false to give the best performance and cannot be used with an xml content type since our xml parser does not support location info note that both url and referrer are canonicalized before theyre used so e g if you pass in https example com jsdom will interpret that as if you had given https example com if you pass an unparseable url the call will throw urls are parsed and serialized according to the url standard executing scripts jsdoms most powerful ability is that it can execute scripts inside the jsdom these scripts can modify the content of the page and access all the web platform apis jsdom implements however this is also highly dangerous when dealing with untrusted content the jsdom sandbox is not foolproof and code running inside the doms script s can if it tries hard enough get access to the node js environment and thus to your machine as such the ability to execute scripts embedded in the html is disabled by default js const dom new jsdom document body appendchild document createelement hr the script will not be executed by default dom window document body children length 1 to enable executing scripts inside the page you can use the runscripts dangerously option js const dom new jsdom document body appendchild document createelement hr runscripts dangerously the script will be executed and modify the dom dom window document body children length 2 again we emphasize to only use this when feeding jsdom code you know is safe if you use it on arbitrary user supplied code or code from the internet you are effectively running untrusted node js code and your machine could be compromised if you want to execute external scripts included via script src youll also need to ensure that they load them to do this add the option resources usable as described below note that event handler attributes like div onclick will also not function unless runscripts is set to dangerously however event handler properties like div onclick will function regardless of runscripts if you are simply trying to execute script from the outside instead of letting script elements and inline event handlers run from the inside you can use the runscripts outside only option which enables window eval js const window new jsdom runscripts outside only window window eval document body innerhtml p hello world p window document body children length 1 this is turned off by default for performance reasons but is safe to enable note that we strongly advise against trying to execute scripts by mashing together the jsdom and node global environments e g by doing global window dom window and then executing scripts or test code inside the node global environment instead you should treat jsdom like you would a browser and run all scripts and tests that need access to a dom inside the jsdom environment using window eval or runscripts dangerously this might require for example creating a browserify bundle to execute as a script elementâ€”just like you would in a browser finally for advanced use cases you can use the dom runvmscript script method documented below pretending to be a visual browser jsdom does not have the capability to render visual content and will act like a headless browser by default it provides hints to web pages through apis such as document hidden that their content is not visible when the pretendtobevisual option is set to true jsdom will pretend that it is rendering and displaying content it does this by changing document hidden to return false instead of true changing document visibilitystate to return visible instead of prerender enabling window requestanimationframe and window cancelanimationframe methods which otherwise do not exist js const window new jsdom pretendtobevisual true window window requestanimationframe timestamp console log timestamp 0 note that jsdom still does not do any layout or rendering so this is really just about pretending to be visual not about implementing the parts of the platform a real visual web browser would implement loading subresources by default jsdom will not load any subresources such as scripts stylesheets images or iframes if youd like jsdom to load such resources you can pass the resources usable option which will load all usable resources those are frames and iframes via frame and iframe stylesheets via link rel stylesheet scripts via script but only if runscripts dangerously is also set images via img but only if the canvas or canvas prebuilt npm package is also installed see canvas support below in the future we plan to offer more customization of resource loading via this option but for now the default and the usable option are the two modes offered virtual consoles like web browsers jsdom has the concept of a console this records both information directly sent from the page via scripts executing inside the document as well as information from the jsdom implementation itself we call the user controllable console a virtual console to distinguish it from the node js console api and from the inside the page window console api by default the jsdom constructor will return an instance with a virtual console that forwards all its output to the node js console to create your own virtual console and pass it to jsdom you can override this default by doing js const virtualconsole new jsdom virtualconsole const dom new jsdom virtualconsole code like this will create a virtual console with no behavior you can give it behavior by adding event listeners for all the possible console methods js virtualconsole on error virtualconsole on warn virtualconsole on info virtualconsole on dir etc see https console spec whatwg org logging note that it is probably best to set up these event listeners before calling new jsdom since errors or console invoking script might occur during parsing if you simply want to redirect the virtual console output to another console like the default node js one you can do js virtualconsole sendto console there is also a special event jsdomerror which will fire with error objects to report errors from jsdom itself this is similar to how error messages often show up in web browser consoles even if they are not initiated by console error so far the following errors are output this way errors loading or parsing subresources scripts stylesheets frames and iframes script execution errors that are not handled by a window onerror event handler that returns true or calls event preventdefault not implemented errors resulting from calls to methods like window alert which jsdom does not implement but installs anyway for web compatibility if youre using sendto c to send errors to c by default it will call console error with information from jsdomerror events if youd prefer to maintain a strict one to one mapping of events to method calls and perhaps handle jsdomerror s yourself then you can do js virtualconsole sendto c omitjsdomerrors true cookie jars like web browsers jsdom has the concept of a cookie jar storing http cookies cookies that have a url on the same domain as the document and are not marked http only are accessible via the document cookie api additionally all cookies in the cookie jar will impact the fetching of subresources by default the jsdom constructor will return an instance with an empty cookie jar to create your own cookie jar and pass it to jsdom you can override this default by doing js const cookiejar new jsdom cookiejar store options const dom new jsdom cookiejar this is mostly useful if you want to share the same cookie jar among multiple jsdoms or prime the cookie jar with certain values ahead of time cookie jars are provided by the tough cookie package the jsdom cookiejar constructor is a subclass of the tough cookie cookie jar which by default sets the loosemode true option since that matches better how browsers behave if you want to use tough cookies utilities and classes yourself you can use the jsdom toughcookie module export to get access to the tough cookie module instance packaged with jsdom intervening before parsing jsdom allows you to intervene in the creation of a jsdom very early after the window and document objects are created but before any html is parsed to populate the document with nodes js const dom new jsdom p hello p beforeparse window window document childnodes length 0 window somecoolapi this is especially useful if you are wanting to modify the environment in some way for example adding shims for web platform apis jsdom does not support jsdom object api once you have constructed a jsdom object it will have the following useful capabilities properties the property window retrieves the window object that was created for you the properties virtualconsole and cookiejar reflect the options you pass in or the defaults created for you if nothing was passed in for those options serializing the document with serialize the serialize method will return the html serialization of the document including the doctype js const dom new jsdom doctype html hello dom serialize doctype html hello contrast with dom window document documentelement outerhtml hello getting the source location of a node with nodelocation node the nodelocation method will find where a dom node is within the source document returning the parse5 location info for the node js const dom new jsdom hello includenodelocations true const document dom window document const bodyel document body implicitly created const pel document queryselector p const textnode pel firstchild const imgel document queryselector img console log dom nodelocation bodyel null its not in the source console log dom nodelocation pel startoffset 0 endoffset 39 starttag endtag console log dom nodelocation textnode startoffset 3 endoffset 13 console log dom nodelocation imgel startoffset 13 endoffset 32 note that this feature only works if you have set the includenodelocations option node locations are off by default for performance reasons running vm created scripts with runvmscript script the built in vm module of node js allows you to create script instances which can be compiled ahead of time and then run multiple times on a given vm context behind the scenes a jsdom window is indeed a vm context to get access to this ability use the runvmscript method js const script require vm const dom new jsdom runscripts outside only const s new script if this ran this ran 0 this ran dom runvmscript s dom runvmscript s dom runvmscript s dom window ran 3 this is somewhat advanced functionality and we advise sticking to normal dom apis such as window eval or document createelement script unless you have very specific needs reconfiguring the jsdom with reconfigure settings the top property on window is marked unforgeable in the spec meaning it is a non configurable own property and thus cannot be overridden or shadowed by normal code running inside the jsdom even using object defineproperty similarly at present jsdom does not handle navigation such as setting window location href https example com doing so will cause the virtual console to emit a jsdomerror explaining that this feature is not implemented and nothing will change there will be no new window or document object and the existing windows location object will still have all the same property values however if youre acting from outside the window e g in some test framework that creates jsdoms you can override one or both of these using the special reconfigure method js const dom new jsdom dom window top dom window dom window location href about blank dom reconfigure windowtop myfaketopfortesting url https example com dom window top myfaketopfortesting dom window location href https example com note that changing the jsdoms url will impact all apis that return the current document url such as window location document url and document documenturi as well as resolution of relative urls within the document and the same origin checks and referrer used while fetching subresources it will not however perform a navigation to the contents of that url the contents of the dom will remain unchanged and no new instances of window document etc will be created convenience apis fromurl in addition to the jsdom constructor itself jsdom provides a promise returning factory method for constructing a jsdom from a url js jsdom fromurl https example com options then dom console log dom serialize the returned promise will fulfill with a jsdom instance if the url is valid and the request is successful any redirects will be followed to their ultimate destination the options provided to fromurl are similar to those provided to the jsdom constructor with the following additional restrictions and consequences the url and contenttype options cannot be provided the referrer option is used as the http referer request header of the initial request the useragent option is used as the http user agent request header of any requests the resulting jsdoms url content type and referrer are determined from the response any cookies set via http set cookie response headers are stored in the jsdoms cookie jar similarly any cookies already in a supplied cookie jar are sent as http cookie request headers the initial request is not infinitely customizable to the same extent as is possible in a package like request fromurl is meant to be a convenience api for the majority of cases if you need greater control over the initial request you should perform it yourself and then use the jsdom constructor manually fromfile similar to fromurl jsdom also provides a fromfile factory method for constructing a jsdom from a filename js jsdom fromfile stuff html options then dom console log dom serialize the returned promise will fulfill with a jsdom instance if the given file can be opened as usual in node js apis the filename is given relative to the current working directory the options provided to fromfile are similar to those provided to the jsdom constructor with the following additional defaults the url option will default to a file url corresponding to the given filename instead of to about blank the contenttype option will default to application xhtml xml if the given filename ends in xhtml or xml otherwise it will continue to default to text html fragment for the very simplest of cases you might not need a whole jsdom instance with all its associated power you might not even need a window or document instead you just need to parse some html and get a dom object you can manipulate for that we have fragment which creates a documentfragment from a given string js const frag jsdom fragment hellohi frag childnodes length 2 frag queryselector strong textcontent why hello there etc here frag is a documentfragment instance whose contents are created by parsing the provided string the parsing is done using a template element so you can include any element there including ones with weird parsing rules like td all invocations of the fragment factory result in documentfragments that share the same owner document and window this allows many calls to fragment with no extra overhead but it also means that calls to fragment cannot be customized with any options note that serialization is not as easy with documentfragments as it is with full jsdom objects if you need to serialize your dom you should probably use the jsdom constructor more directly but for the special case of a fragment containing a single element its pretty easy to do through normal means js const frag jsdom fragment p hello p console log frag firstchild outerhtml logs p hello p other noteworthy features canvas support jsdom includes support for using the canvas or canvas prebuilt package to extend any canvas elements with the canvas api to make this work you need to include canvas as a dependency in your project as a peer of jsdom if jsdom can find the canvas package it will use it but if its not present then canvas elements will behave like div s encoding sniffing in addition to supplying a string the jsdom constructor can also be supplied binary data in the form of a node js buffer or a standard javascript binary data type like arraybuffer uint8array dataview etc when this is done jsdom will sniff the encoding from the supplied bytes scanning for meta charset tags just like a browser does this encoding sniffing also applies to jsdom fromfile and jsdom fromurl in the latter case just as in a browser any content type headers sent with the response will take priority note that in many cases supplying bytes in this fashion can be better than supplying a string for example if you attempt to use node jss buffer tostring utf 8 api node js will not strip any leading boms if you then give this string to jsdom it will interpret it verbatim leaving the bom intact but jsdoms binary data decoding code will strip leading boms just like a browser in such cases supplying buffer directly will give the desired result closing down a jsdom timers in the jsdom set by window settimeout or window setinterval will by definition execute code in the future in the context of the window since there is no way to execute code in the future without keeping the process alive outstanding jsdom timers will keep your node js process alive similarly since there is no way to execute code in the context of an object without keeping that object alive outstanding jsdom timers will prevent garbage collection of the window on which they are scheduled if you want to be sure to shut down a jsdom window use window close which will terminate all running timers and also remove any event listeners on the window and document running jsdom inside a web browser jsdom has some support for being run inside a web browser using browserify that is inside a web browser you can use a browserified jsdom to create an entirely self contained set of plain javascript objects which look and act much like the browsers existing dom objects while being entirely independent of them virtual dom indeed jsdoms primary target is still node js and so we use language features that are only present in recent node js versions namely node js v6 thus older browsers will likely not work even transpilation will not help much we plan to use proxys extensively throughout the course of jsdom v10 x notably jsdom works well inside a web worker the original contributor lawnsea who made this possible has published a paper about his project which uses this capability not everything works perfectly when running jsdom inside a web browser sometimes that is because of fundamental limitations such as not having filesystem access but sometimes it is simply because we havent spent enough time making the appropriate small tweaks bug reports are certainly welcome debugging the dom using chrome devtools as of node js v6 you can debug programs using chrome devtools see the official documentation for how to get started by default jsdom elements are formatted as plain old js objects in the console to make it easier to debug you can use jsdom devtools formatter which lets you inspect them like real dom elements caveats asynchronous script loading people often have trouble with asynchronous script loading when using jsdom many pages loads scripts asynchronously but there is no way to tell when theyre done doing so and thus when its a good time to run your code and inspect the resulting dom structure this is a fundamental limitation we cannot predict what scripts on the web page will do and so cannot tell you when they are done loading more scripts this can be worked around in a few ways the best way if you control the page in question is to use whatever mechanisms are given by the script loader to detect when loading is done for example if youre using a module loader like requirejs the code could look like js on the node js side const window new jsdom window window onmodulesloaded console log ready to roll html inside the html you supply to jsdom script requirejs entry module window onmodulesloaded script if you do not control the page you could try workarounds such as polling for the presence of a specific element for more details see the discussion in 640 especially matthewkastors insightful comment shared constructors and prototypes at the present time for most web platform apis jsdom shares the same class definition between multiple seemingly independent jsdoms that means that for example the following situation can occur js const dom1 new jsdom const dom2 new jsdom dom1 window element prototype expando blah console log dom2 window document createelement frameset expando logs blah this is done mainly for performance and memory reasons creating separate copies of all the many classes on the web platform each time we create a jsdom would be rather expensive nevertheless we remain interested in one day providing an option to create an independent jsdom at the cost of some performance missing features in the new api compared to the old jsdom api from v9 x and before the new api is noticeably missing fine grained control of resource loads previous versions of jsdom allowed you to set options that were used when making requests both for the initial request in the old equivalent of jsdom fromurl and for subresource requests they also allowed you to control which subresources were requested and applied to the main document so that you could e g download stylesheets but not scripts finally they provided a customizable resource loader that let you intercept any outgoing request and fulfill it with a completely synthetic response none of these features are yet in the new jsdom api although we are hoping to add them back soon this requires a decent amount of behind the scenes work to implement in a reasonable way unfortunately in the meantime please feel free to use the old jsdom api to get access to this functionality it is supported and maintained although it will not be getting new features the documentation is found in lib old api md unimplemented parts of the web platform although we enjoy adding new features to jsdom and keeping it up to date with the latest web specs it has many missing apis please feel free to file an issue for anything missing but were a small and busy team so a pull request might work even better beyond just features that we havent gotten to yet there are two major features that are currently outside the scope of jsdom these are navigation the ability to change the global object and all other objects when clicking a link or assigning location href or similar layout the ability to calculate where elements will be visually laid out as a result of css which impacts methods like getboundingclientrects or properties like offsettop currently jsdom has dummy behaviors for some aspects of these features such as sending a not implemented jsdomerror to the virtual console for navigation or returning zeros for many layout related properties often you can work around these limitations in your code e g by creating new jsdom instances for each page you navigate to during a crawl or using object defineproperty to change what various layout related getters and methods return note that other tools in the same space such as phantomjs do support these features on the wiki we have a more complete writeup about jsdom vs phantomjs getting help if you need help with jsdom please feel free to use any of the following venues the mailing list best for how
