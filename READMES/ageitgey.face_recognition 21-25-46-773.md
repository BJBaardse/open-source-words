face recognition recognize and manipulate faces from python or from the command line with the worlds simplest face recognition library built using dlibs state of the art face recognition built with deep learning the model has an accuracy of 99 38 on the labeled faces in the wild benchmark this also provides a simple face recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line features find faces in pictures find all the faces that appear in a picture python import face recognition image face recognition load image file your file jpg face locations face recognition face locations image find and manipulate facial features in pictures get the locations and outlines of each persons eyes nose mouth and chin python import face recognition image face recognition load image file your file jpg face landmarks list face recognition face landmarks image finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff but you can also use for really stupid stuff like applying digital make up think meitu identify faces in pictures recognize who appears in each photo python import face recognition known image face recognition load image file biden jpg unknown image face recognition load image file unknown jpg biden encoding face recognition face encodings known image 0 unknown encoding face recognition face encodings unknown image 0 results face recognition compare faces biden encoding unknown encoding you can even use this library with other python libraries to do real time face recognition see this example for the code installation requirements python 3 3 or python 2 7 macos or linux windows not officially supported but might work installation options installing on mac or linux first make sure you have dlib already installed with python bindings how to install dlib from source on macos or ubuntu then install this module from pypi using pip3 or pip2 for python 2 bash pip3 install face recognition if you are having trouble with installation you can also try out a pre configured vm installing on raspberry pi 2 raspberry pi 2 installation instructions installing on windows while windows isnt officially supported helpful users have posted instructions on how to install this library masoudrs windows 10 installation guide dlib face recognition installing a pre configured virtual machine image download the pre configured vm image for vmware player or virtualbox usage command line interface when you install face recognition you get a two simple command line programs face recognition recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs face detection find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs face recognition command line tool the face recognition command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs first you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you already know there should be one image file for each person with the files named according to who is in the picture next you need a second folder with the files you want to identify then in you simply run the command face recognition passing in the folder of known people and the folder or single image with unknown people and it tells you who is in each image bash face recognition pictures of people i know unknown pictures unknown pictures unknown jpg barack obama face recognition test unknown pictures unknown jpg unknown person theres one line in the output for each face the data is comma separated with the filename and the name of the person found an unknown person is a face in the image that didnt match anyone in your folder of known people face detection command line tool the face detection command lets you find the location pixel coordinatates of any faces in an image just run the command face detection passing in a folder of images to check or a single image bash face detection folder with pictures examples image1 jpg 65 215 169 112 examples image2 jpg 62 394 211 244 examples image2 jpg 95 941 244 792 it prints one line for each face that was detected the coordinates reported are the top right bottom and left coordinates of the face in pixels adjusting tolerance sensitivity if you are getting multiple matches for the same person it might be that the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value is needed to make face comparisons more strict you can do that with the tolerance parameter the default tolerance value is 0 6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict bash face recognition tolerance 0 54 pictures of people i know unknown pictures unknown pictures unknown jpg barack obama face recognition test unknown pictures unknown jpg unknown person if you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order to adjust the tolerance setting you can use show distance true bash face recognition show distance true pictures of people i know unknown pictures unknown pictures unknown jpg barack obama 0 378542298956785 face recognition test unknown pictures unknown jpg unknown person none more examples if you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but dont care about file names you could do this bash face recognition pictures of people i know unknown pictures cut d f2 barack obama unknown person speeding up face recognition face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with multiple cpu cores for example if your system has 4 cpu cores you can process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using all your cpu cores in parallel if you are using python 3 4 or newer pass in a cpus number of cpu cores to use parameter bash face recognition cpus 4 pictures of people i know unknown pictures you can also pass in cpus 1 to use all cpu cores in your system python module you can import the face recognition module and then easily manipulate faces with just a couple of lines of code its super easy api docs https face recognition readthedocs io automatically find all the faces in an image python import face recognition image face recognition load image file my picture jpg face locations face recognition face locations image face locations is now an array listing the co ordinates of each face see this example to try it out you can also opt in to a somewhat more accurate deep learning based face detection model note gpu acceleration via nvidias cuda library is required for good performance with this model youll also want to enable cuda support when compliling dlib python import face recognition image face recognition load image file my picture jpg face locations face recognition face locations image model cnn face locations is now an array listing the co ordinates of each face see this example to try it out if you have a lot of images and a gpu you can also find faces in batches automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image python import face recognition image face recognition load image file my picture jpg face landmarks list face recognition face landmarks image face landmarks list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face face landmarks list 0 left eye would be the location and outline of the first persons left eye see this example to try it out recognize faces in images and identify who they are python import face recognition picture of me face recognition load image file me jpg my face encoding face recognition face encodings picture of me 0 my face encoding now contains a universal encoding of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face unknown picture face recognition load image file unknown jpg unknown face encoding face recognition face encodings unknown picture 0 now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with compare faces results face recognition compare faces my face encoding unknown face encoding if results 0 true print its a picture of me else print its not a picture of me see this example to try it out python code examples all the examples are available here face detection find faces in a photograph find faces in a photograph using deep learning find faces in batches of images w gpu using deep learning blur all the faces in a live video using your webcam requires opencv to be installed facial features identify specific facial features in a photograph apply horribly ugly digital make up facial recognition find and recognize unknown faces in a photograph based on photographs of known people identify and draw boxes around each person in a photo compare faces by numeric face distance instead of only true false matches recognize faces in live video using your webcam simple slower version requires opencv to be installed recognize faces in live video using your webcam faster version requires opencv to be installed recognize faces in a video file and write out new video file requires opencv to be installed recognize faces on a raspberry pi w camera run a web service to recognize faces via http requires flask to be installed recognize faces with a k nearest neighbors classifier articles and guides that cover face recognition my article on how face recognition works modern face recognition with deep learning covers the algorithms and how they generally work face recognition with opencv python and deep learning by adrian rosebrock covers how to use face recognition in practice raspberry pi face recognition by adrian rosebrock covers how to use this on a raspberry pi face clustering with python by adrian rosebrock covers how to automatically cluster photos based on who appears in each photo using unsupervised learning how face recognition works if you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of depending on a black box library read my article caveats the face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children it tends to mix up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0 6 accuracy may vary between ethnic groups please see this wiki page for more details deployment to cloud hosts heroku aws etc since face recognition depends on dlib which is written in c it can be tricky to deploy an app using it to a cloud hosting provider like heroku or aws to make things easier theres an example dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with face recognition in a docker container with that you should be able to deploy to any service that supports docker images having problems if you run into problems please read the common errors section of the wiki before filing a github issue thanks many many thanks to davis king nulhom for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models used in this library for more information on the resnet that powers the face encodings check out his blog post thanks to everyone who works on all the awesome python data science libraries like numpy scipy scikit image pillow etc etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in python thanks to cookiecutter and the audreyr cookiecutter pypackage project template for making python project packaging way more tolerable
