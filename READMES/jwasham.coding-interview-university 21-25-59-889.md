coding interview university i originally created this as a short to do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer but it grew to the large list you see today after going through this study plan i got hired as a software development engineer at amazon you probably wont have to study as much as i did anyway everything you need is here the items listed here will prepare you well for an interview at just about any software company including the giants amazon facebook google or microsoft best of luck to you translations 中文版本 tiếng việt vietnamese español português brasileiro translations in progress हिन्दी עברית bahasa indonesia arabic turkish french russian ukrainian korean 한국어 telugu polish urdu thai greek italian malayalam japanese 日本語 what is it this is my multi month study plan for going from web developer self taught no cs degree to software engineer for a large company this is meant for new software engineers or those switching from software web development to software engineering where computer science knowledge is required if you have many years of experience and are claiming many years of software engineering experience expect a harder interview if you have many years of software web development experience note that large software companies like google amazon facebook and microsoft view software engineering as different from software web development and they require computer science knowledge if you want to be a reliability engineer or operations engineer study more from the optional list networking security table of contents what is it why use it how to use it dont feel you arent smart enough about video resources interview process general interview prep pick one language for the interview book list before you get started what you wont see

project i didnt know a stack from a heap didnt know big o anything anything about trees or how to traverse a graph if i had to code a sorting algorithm i can tell ya it wouldnt have been very good every data structure ive ever used was built into the language and i didnt know how they worked under the hood at all ive never had to manage memory unless a process i was running would give an out of memory error and then id have to find a workaround ive used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and thousands of associative arrays but ive never created data structures from scratch its a long plan it may take you months if you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time how to use it everything below is an outline and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom im using githubs special markdown flavor including tasks lists to check progress create a new branch so you can check items like this just put an x in the brackets x fork a branch and follow the commands below git checkout b progress git remote add jwasham https github com jwasham coding interview university git fetch all mark all boxes with x after you completed your changes git add git commit m marked x git rebase jwasham master git push force more about github flavored markdown dont feel you arent smart enough successful software engineers are smart but many have an insecurity that they arent smart enough the myth of the genius programmer its dangerous to go alone battling the invisible monsters in tech believe you can change about video resources some videos are available only by enrolling in a coursera edx or lynda com class these are called moocs sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months so you have no access lynda com courses are not free id appreciate your help to add free and always available public sources such as youtube videos to accompany the online course videos i like using university lectures interview

microsoft video prep course software engineer interview unleashed paid course learn how to make yourself ready for software engineer interviews from a former google interviewer python for data structures algorithms and interviews paid course a python centric interview prep course which covers data structures algorithms mock interviews and much more pick one language for the interview you can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview but for large companies these are solid choices c java python you could also use these but read around first there may be caveats javascript ruby you need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable read more about choices http www byte by byte com choose the right language for your coding interview http blog codingforinterviews com best programming language jobs see language resources here youll see some c c and python learning included below because im learning there are a few books involved see the bottom book list this is a shorter list than what i used this is abbreviated to save you time interview prep programming interviews exposed secrets to landing your next job 2nd edition answers in c and java this is a good warm up for cracking the coding interview not too difficult most problems may be easier than what youll see in an interview from what ive read cracking the coding interview 6th edition answers in java if you have tons of extra time elements of programming interviews c version elements of programming interviews java version book companion project method stub and test cases for every problem in the book computer architecture if short on time write great code volume 1 understanding the machine the book was published in 2004 and is somewhat outdated but its a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief the author invented hla so take mentions and examples in hla with a grain of salt not widely used but decent examples of what assembly looks like these chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation chapter 2 numeric representation chapter 3 binary arithmetic and bit operations chapter 4 floating point representation chapter 5 character representation chapter 6 memory organization and access chapter 7 composite data types and memory objects chapter 9 cpu architecture chapter 10 instruction set architecture chapter 11 memory architecture and organization if you have more time i want this book computer architecture sixth edition a quantitative approach for a richer more up to date 2017 but longer treatment language specific you need to choose a language for the interview see above here are my recommendations by language i dont have resources for all languages i welcome additions if you read though one of these you should have all the data structures and algorithms knowledge youll need to start doing coding problems you can skip all the video lectures in this project unless youd like a review additional language specific resources here c i havent read these two but they are highly rated and written by sedgewick hes awesome algorithms in c parts 1 4 fundamentals data structure sorting searching algorithms in c part 5 graph algorithms if you have a better recommendation for c please let me know looking for a comprehensive resource java algorithms sedgewick and wayne videos with book content and sedgewick algorithms i algorithms ii or data structures and algorithms in java by goodrich tamassia goldwasser used as optional text for cs intro course at uc berkeley see my book report on the python version below this book covers the same topics python data structures and algorithms in python by goodrich tamassia goldwasser i loved this book it covered everything and more pythonic code my glowing book report https startupnextdoor com book report data structures and algorithms in python optional books some people recommend these but i think its going overboard unless you have many years of software engineering experience and expect a much harder interview algorithm design manual skiena as a review and problem recognition the algorithm catalog portion is well beyond the scope of difficulty youll get in an interview this book has 2 parts class textbook on data structures and algorithms pros is a good review as any algorithms textbook would be nice stories from his experiences solving problems in industry and academia code examples in c cons can be as dense or impenetrable as clrs and in some cases clrs may be a better alternative for some subjects chapters 7 8 9 can be painful to try to follow as some items are not explained well or require more brain than i have dont get me wrong i like skiena his teaching style and mannerisms but i may not be stony brook material algorithm catalog this is the real reason you buy this book about to get to this part will update here once ive made my way through it can rent it on kindle answers solutions solutions errata introduction to algorithms important reading this book will only have limited value this book is a great review of algorithms and data structures but wont teach you how to write good code you have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently aka clr sometimes clrs because stein was late to the game programming pearls the first couple of chapters present clever solutions to programming problems some very old using data tape but that is just an intro this a guidebook on program design and architecture much like code complete but much shorter algorithms and programming problems and solutions by shen a fine book but after working through problems on several pages i got frustrated with the pascal do while loops 1 indexed arrays and unclear post condition satisfaction results would rather spend time on coding problems from another book or online coding problems before you get started this list grew over many months and yes it kind of got out of hand here are some mistakes i made so youll have a better experience 1 you wont remember it all i watched hours of videos and took copious notes and months later there was much i didnt remember i spent 3 days going through my notes and making flashcards so i could review read please so you wont make my mistakes retaining computer science knowledge 2 use flashcards to solve the problem i made a little flashcards site where i could add flashcards of 2 types general and code each card has different formatting i made a mobile first website so i could review on my phone and tablet wherever i am make your own for free flashcards site repo my flash cards database old 1200 cards my flash cards database new 1800 cards keep in mind i went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and python trivia to machine learning and statistics its way too much for whats required note on flashcards the first time you recognize you know the answer dont mark it as known you have to see the same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it repetition will put that knowledge deeper in your brain an alternative to using my flashcard site is anki which has been recommended to me numerous times it uses a repetition system to help you remember its user friendly available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system it costs 25 on ios but is free on other platforms my flashcard database in anki format https ankiweb net shared info 25173560 thanks xiewenya 3 review review review i keep a set of cheat sheets on ascii osi stack big o notations and more i study them when i have some spare time take a break from programming problems for a half hour and go through your flashcards 4 focus there are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time focus and concentration are hard what you wont see covered these are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan sql javascript html css and other front end technologies the daily plan some subjects take one day and some will take multiple days some are just learning with nothing to implement each day i take one subject from the list below watch videos about that subject and write an implementation in c using structs and functions that take a struct and something else as args c without using built in types c using built in types like stls std list for a linked list python using built in types to keep practicing python and write tests to ensure im doing it right sometimes just using simple assert statements you may do java or something else this is just my thing you dont need all these you need only one language for the interview why code in all of these practice practice practice until im sick of it and can do it with no problem some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember work within the raw constraints allocating freeing memory without help of garbage collection except python make use of built in types so i have experience using the built in tools for real world use not going to write my own linked list implementation in production i may not have time to do all of these for every subject but ill try you can see my code here c c python you dont need to memorize the guts of every algorithm write code on a whiteboard or paper not a computer test with some sample inputs then test it out on a computer prerequisite knowledge learn c c is everywhere youll see examples in books lectures videos everywhere while youre studying c programming language vol 2 this is a short book but it will give you a great handle on the c language and if you practice it a little youll

about memorizing answers to programming problems why you need to practice doing programming problems problem recognition and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in gathering requirements for the problem talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview coding on a whiteboard or paper not a computer coming up with time and space complexity for your

challenges faced best worst designs seen ideas for improving an existing product how do you work best as an individual and as part of a team which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why what did you most enjoy at job x project y what was the biggest challenge you faced at job x project y what was the hardest bug you faced at job x project y what did you learn at job x project y what would you have done better at job x project y have questions for the interviewer some of mine i already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective how large is your team what does your dev cycle look like do you do waterfall sprints agile are rushes to deadlines common or is there flexibility how are decisions made in your team how many meetings do you have per week do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate what are you working on what do you like about it what is the work life like once youve got the job congratulations keep learning youre

how its implemented among balanced search trees avl and 2 3 trees are now passé and red black trees seem to be more popular a particularly interesting self organizing data structure is the splay tree which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root skiena of these i chose to implement a splay tree from what ive read you wont implement a balanced search tree in your interview but i wanted exposure to coding one up and lets face it splay trees are the bees knees i did read a lot of red black tree code splay tree insert search delete functions if you end up implementing red black tree try just these search and insertion functions skipping delete i want to learn more about b tree since its used so widely with very large data sets self balancing binary search tree avl trees in practice from what i can tell these arent used much in practice but i could see where they would be the avl tree is another structure supporting o log n search insertion and removal it is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval this makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction such as language dictionaries or program dictionaries such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter mit avl trees avl sort video avl trees video avl tree implementation video split and merge splay trees in practice splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches memory allocators routers garbage collectors data compression ropes replacement of string used for long text strings in windows nt in the virtual memory networking and file system code etc cs 61b splay trees video mit lecture splay trees gets very mathy but watch the last 10 minutes for sure video red black trees these are a translation of a 2 3 tree see below in practice red–black trees offer worst case guarantees for insertion time deletion time and search time not only does this make them valuable in time sensitive applications such as real time applications but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst case guarantees for example many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees and the completely fair scheduler used in current linux kernels uses red–black trees in the version 8 of java the collection hashmap has been modified such that instead of using a linkedlist to store identical elements with poor hashcodes a red black tree is used aduni algorithms lecture 4 link jumps to starting point video aduni algorithms lecture 5 video red black tree an introduction to binary search and red black tree 2 3 search trees in practice 2 3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches since height is more compared to avl trees you would use 2 3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes instead people use red black trees 23 tree intuition and definition video binary view of 23 tree 2 3 trees student recitation video 2 3 4 trees aka 2 4 trees in practice for every 2 4 tree there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order the insertion and deletion operations on 2 4 trees are also equivalent to color flipping and rotations in red–black trees this makes 2 4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2 4 trees just before red–black trees even though 2 4 trees are not often used in practice cs 61b lecture 26 balanced search trees video
