zsh autosuggestions fish like fast unobtrusive autosuggestions for zsh it suggests commands as you type based on command history requirements zsh v4 3 11 or later installation see install md usage as you type commands you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color this color can be changed by setting the zsh autosuggest highlight style variable see configuration if you press the â†’ key forward char widget or end end of line widget with the cursor at the end of the buffer it will accept the suggestion replacing the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion if you invoke the forward word widget it will partially accept the suggestion up to the point that the cursor moves to configuration you may want to override the default global config variables after sourcing the plugin default values of these variables can be found here note if you are using oh my zsh you can put this configuration in a file in the zsh custom directory see their comments on overriding internals suggestion highlight style set zsh autosuggest highlight style to configure the style that the suggestion is shown with the default is fg 8 suggestion strategy set zsh autosuggest strategy to choose the strategy for generating suggestions there are currently two to choose from default chooses the most recent match match prev cmd chooses the most recent match whose preceding history item matches the most recently executed command more info note that this strategy wont work as expected with zsh options that dont preserve the history order such as hist ignore all dups or hist expire dups first widget mapping this plugin works by triggering custom behavior when certain zle widgets are invoked you can add and remove widgets from these arrays to change the behavior of this plugin zsh autosuggest clear widgets widgets in this array will clear the suggestion when invoked zsh autosuggest accept widgets widgets in this array will accept the suggestion when invoked zsh autosuggest execute widgets widgets in this array will execute the suggestion when invoked zsh autosuggest partial accept widgets widgets in this array will partially accept the suggestion when invoked zsh autosuggest ignore widgets widgets in this array will not trigger any custom behavior widgets that modify the buffer and are not found in any of these arrays will fetch a new suggestion after they are invoked note a widget shouldnt belong to more than one of the above arrays disabling suggestion for large buffers set zsh autosuggest buffer max size to an integer value to disable autosuggestion for large buffers the default is unset which means that autosuggestion will be tried for any buffer size recommended value is 20 this can be useful when pasting large amount of text in the terminal to avoid triggering autosuggestion for too long strings enable asynchronous mode as of v0 4 0 suggestions can be fetched asynchronously using the zsh zpty module to enable this behavior set the zsh autosuggest use async variable it can be set to anything key bindings this plugin provides a few widgets that you can use with bindkey autosuggest accept accepts the current suggestion autosuggest execute accepts and executes the current suggestion autosuggest clear clears the current suggestion autosuggest fetch fetches a suggestion works even when suggestions are disabled autosuggest disable disables suggestions autosuggest enable re enables suggestions autosuggest toggle toggles between enabled disabled suggestions for example this would bind ctrl space to accept the current suggestion sh bindkey autosuggest accept troubleshooting if you have a problem please search through the list of issues on github to see if someone else has already reported it reporting an issue before reporting an issue please try temporarily disabling sections of your configuration and other plugins that may be conflicting with this plugin to isolate the problem when reporting an issue please include the smallest simplest zshrc configuration that will reproduce the problem see this comment for a good example of what this means the version of zsh youre using zsh version which operating system youre running uninstallation remove the code referencing this plugin from zshrc remove the git repository from your hard drive sh rm rf zsh zsh autosuggestions or wherever you installed development build process edit the source files in src run make to build zsh autosuggestions zsh from those source files pull requests pull requests are welcome if you send a pull request please request to merge into the develop branch not master match the existing coding conventions include helpful comments to keep the barrier to entry low for people new to the project write tests that cover your code as much as possible testing tests are written in ruby using the rspec framework they use tmux to drive a pseudoterminal sending simulated keystrokes and making assertions on the terminal content test files live in spec to run the tests run make test to run a specific test run tests spec some spec rb make test you can also specify a zsh binary to use by setting the test zsh bin environment variable ex test zsh bin bin zsh make test license this project is licensed under mit license for the full text of the license see the license file
