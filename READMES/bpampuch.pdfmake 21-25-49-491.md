pdfmake client server side pdf printing in pure javascript check out the playground and examples features line wrapping text alignments left right centered justified numbered and bulleted lists tables and columns auto fixed star sized widths col spans and row spans headers automatically repeated in case of a page break images and vector graphics convenient styling and style inheritance page headers and footers static or dynamic content access to current page number and page count background layer page dimensions and orientations margins custom page breaks font embedding support for complex multi level nested structures table of contents helper methods for opening printing downloading the generated pdf setting of pdf metadata e g author subject getting started this document will walk you through the basics of pdfmake and will show you how to create pdf files in the browser if youre interested in server side printing check the examples folder to begin with the default configuration you should include two files pdfmake min js vfs fonts js default font definition it contains roboto you can however use custom fonts instead html doctype html html lang en head meta charset utf 8 title my first pdfmake example title script src build pdfmake min js script script src build vfs fonts js script head body you can get both files using npm server side and client side npm install pdfmake for server side use require pdfmake for client side use require pdfmake build pdfmake js and require pdfmake build vfs fonts js or bower client side bower install pdfmake or copy them directly from the build directory from the repository otherwise you can always build it from sources supported browsers see issue document definition object pdfmake follows a declarative approach it basically means youll never have to calculate positions manually or use commands like writetext text x y movedown etc as you would with a lot of other libraries the most fundamental concept to be mastered is the document definition object which can be as simple as js var docdefinition content this is an sample pdf printed with pdfmake or become pretty complex having multi level tables images lists paragraphs margins styles etc as soon as you have the document definition object youre ready to create and download open print the pdf js pdfmake createpdf docdefinition download pdfmake createpdf docdefinition

paragraph or its part js var docdefinition content if you dont need styles you can use a simple string to define a paragraph this is a standard paragraph using default style using a text object lets you set styling properties text this paragraph will have a bigger font fontsize 15 if you set the value of text to an array instead of a string youll be able to style any part individually text this paragraph is defined as an array of elements to make it possible to text restyle part of it and make it bigger fontsize 15 than the rest style dictionaries its also possible to define a dictionary of reusable styles js var docdefinition content text this is a header style header no styling here this is a standard paragraph text another text style anotherstyle text multiple styles applied style header anotherstyle styles header fontsize 22 bold true anotherstyle italics true alignment right to have a deeper understanding of styling in pdfmake style inheritance and local style overrides check styles1 styles2 and styles3 examples in playground columns by default paragraphs are rendered as a vertical stack of elements one below another it is possible however to divide available space into columns js var docdefinition content this paragraph fills full width as there are no columns next paragraph however consists of three columns columns auto sized columns have their widths based on their content width auto text first column star sized columns fill the remaining space if theres more than one star column available width is divided equally width text second column fixed width width 100 text third column width width 20 text fourth column optional space between columns columngap 10 this paragraph goes below all columns and has full width column content is not limited to a simple text it can actually contain any valid pdfmake element make sure to look at the columns example in playground tables conceptually tables are similar to columns they can however have headers borders and cells spanning over multiple columns rows js var docdefinition content layout lighthorizontallines optional table headers are automatically repeated if the table spans over multiple pages you can declare how many rows should be treated as headers headerrows 1 widths auto 100 body first second third the last one value 1 value 2 value 3 value 4 text bold value bold true val 2 val 3 val 4 own table layouts own table layouts must be defined before calling pdfmake createpdf docdefinition js pdfmake tablelayouts examplelayout hlinewidth function i node if i 0 i node table body length return 0 return i node table headerrows 2 1 vlinewidth function i return 0 hlinecolor function i return i 1 black aaa paddingleft function i return i 0 0 8 paddingright function i node return i node table widths length 1 0 8 download the pdf pdfmake createpdf docdefinition download all concepts related to tables are covered by tables example in playground lists pdfmake supports both numbered and bulleted lists js var docdefinition content bulleted list example to treat a paragraph as a bulleted list set an array of items under the ul key ul item 1 item 2 item 3 text item 4 bold true numbered list example for numbered lists set the ol key ol item 1 item 2 item 3 headers and footers page headers and footers in pdfmake can be static or dynamic they use the same syntax js var docdefinition header simple text footer columns left part text right part alignment right content for dynamically generated content including page numbers page count and page size you can pass a function to the header or footer js var docdefinition footer function currentpage pagecount return currentpage tostring of pagecount header function currentpage pagecount pagesize you can apply any logic and return any valid pdfmake element return text simple text alignment currentpage 2 left right canvas type rect x 170 y 32 w pagesize width 170 h 40 background layer the background layer will be added on every page js var docdefinition background simple text content it may contain any other object as well images tables or be dynamically generated js var docdefinition background function currentpage pagesize returnpage currentpage with size pagesize width x pagesize height content margins any element in pdfmake can have a margin js margin left top right bottom text sample margin 5 2 10 20 margin horizontal vertical text another text margin 5 2 margin equallefttoprightbottom text last one margin 5 stack of paragraphs you could have figured out by now from the examples that if you set the content key to an array the document becomes a stack of paragraphs youll quite often reuse this structure in a nested element like in the following example js var docdefinition content paragraph 1 paragraph 2 columns first column is a simple text second column consists of paragraphs paragraph a paragraph b these paragraphs will be rendered one below another inside the column the problem with an array is that you cannot add styling properties to it to change fontsize for example the good news is array is just a shortcut in pdfmake for stack so if you want to restyle the whole stack you can do it using the expanded definition js var docdefinition content paragraph 1 paragraph 2 columns first column is a simple text stack second column consists of paragraphs paragraph a paragraph b these paragraphs will be rendered one below another inside the column fontsize 15 images this is simple just use the image node type jpeg and png formats are supported js var docdefinition content youll most often use datauri images on the browser side if no width height fit is provided the original size will be used image data image jpeg base64 encodedcontent if you specify width image will scale proportionally image data image jpeg base64 encodedcontent width 150 if you specify both width and height image will be stretched image data image jpeg base64 encodedcontent width 150 height 150 you can also fit the image inside a rectangle image data image jpeg base64 encodedcontent fit 100 100 if you reuse the same image in multiple nodes you should put it to to images dictionary and reference it by name image mysuperimage under nodejs or in case you use virtual file system provided by pdfmake you can also pass file names here image myimagedictionary image1 jpg images mysuperimage data image jpeg base64 content links to add external or internal links use the following syntax text google link http google com text go to page 2 linktopage 2 table of contents js var docdefinition content toc id maintoc optional title text index style header text this is a header style header tocitem true or tocitem maintoc if is used id in toc or tocitem maintoc subtoc for multiple tocs page dimensions orientation and margins js var docdefinition a string or width number height number pagesize a5 by default we use portrait you can change it to landscape if you wish pageorientation landscape left top right bottom or horizontal vertical or just a number for equal margins pagemargins 40 60 40 60 if you set pagesize to a string you can use one of the following values 4a0 2a0 a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10 ra0 ra1 ra2 ra3 ra4 sra0 sra1 sra2 sra3 sra4 executive folio legal letter tabloid to change page orientation within a document add a page break with the new page orientation js pageorientation portrait content text text on portrait text text on landscape pageorientation landscape pagebreak before text text on landscape 2 pageorientation portrait pagebreak after text text on portrait 2 dynamically control page breaks for instance to avoid orphan children a pagebreakbefore function can be specified which can determine if a page break should be inserted before a node to implement a no orphan child rule use a definition like this javascript var dd content text 1 headline headlinelevel 1 some long text of variable length text 2 headline headlinelevel 1 some long text of variable length text 3 headline headlinelevel 1 some long text of variable length pagebreakbefore function currentnode followingnodesonpage nodesonnextpage previousnodesonpage return currentnode headlinelevel 1 followingnodesonpage length 0 if pagebreakbefore returns true a page break will be added before the currentnode current node has the following information attached javascript id as specified in doc definition headlinelevel as specified in doc definition text as specified in doc definition ul as

document excluding margins horizontalratio 0 0 the ratio of space used horizontally in this document excluding margins document metadata pdf documents can have various metadata associated with them such as the title or author of the document you can add that information by adding it to the document definition js var docdefinition info title awesome document author john doe subject subject of document keywords keywords for document content this is an sample pdf printed with pdfmake standard properties title the title of the document author the name of the author subject the subject of the document keywords keywords associated with the document creator the creator of the document default is pdfmake producer the producer of the document default is pdfmake creationdate the date the document was created added automatically by pdfmake moddate the date the document was last modified trapped the trapped flag in a pdf document indicates whether the document has been trapped custom properties you can add custom properties key of property not contain spaces compression compression of pdf is enabled by default use compress false for disable js var docdefinition compress false content building from sources using npm git clone https github com bpampuch pdfmake git cd pdfmake npm install npm run build using yarn git clone https github com bpampuch pdfmake git cd pdfmake yarn yarn run build coming soon hmmm let me know what you need the goal is quite simple make pdfmake useful for a looooooooot of people and help building responsive html5 apps with printing support theres one thing on the roadmap for v2 no deadline however make the library hackable so you can write plugins to extend document definition model with things like chart add syntax translators like the provided stack build custom dsls on top of document definition model this is actually possible at the moment license mit authors bpampuch founder liborm85 pdfmake is based on a truly amazing library
