go ethereum official golang implementation of the ethereum protocol automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch binary archives are published at https geth ethereum org downloads building the source for prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the installation instructions on the wiki building geth requires both a go version 1 7 or later and a c compiler you can install them using your favourite package manager once the dependencies are installed run make geth or to build the full suite of utilities make all executables the go ethereum project comes with several wrappers executables found in the cmd directory command description geth our main ethereum cli client it is the entry point into the ethereum network main test or private net capable of running as a full node default archive node retaining all historical state or a light node retrieving data live it can be used by other processes as a gateway into the ethereum network via json rpc endpoints exposed on top of http websocket and or ipc transports geth help and the cli wiki page for command line options abigen source code generator to convert ethereum contract definitions into easy to use compile time type safe go packages it operates on plain ethereum contract abis with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available however it also accepts solidity source files making development much more streamlined please see our native dapps wiki page for details bootnode stripped down version of our ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol but does not run any of the higher level application protocols it can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks evm developer utility version of the evm ethereum virtual machine that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode its purpose is to allow isolated fine grained debugging of evm opcodes e g evm code 60ff60ff debug gethrpctest developer utility tool to support our ethereum rpc test test suite which validates baseline conformity to the

network swarm help for command line options and subcommands see https swarm guide readthedocs io for swarm documentation puppeth a cli wizard that aids in creating a new ethereum network running geth going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here please consult our cli wiki page but weve enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your own geth instance full node on the main ethereum network by far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the ethereum network create accounts transfer funds deploy and interact with contracts for this particular use case the user doesnt care about years old historical data so we can fast sync quickly to the current state of the network to do so geth console this command will start geth in fast sync mode default can be changed with the syncmode flag causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the ethereum network which is very cpu intensive start up geths built in interactive javascript console via the trailing console subcommand through which you can invoke all official web3 methods as well as geths own management apis this too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running geth instance with geth attach full node on the ethereum test network transitioning towards developers if youd like to play around with creating ethereum contracts you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the entire system in other words instead of attaching to the main network you want to join the test network with your node which is fully equivalent to the main network but with play ether only geth testnet console the console subcommand have the exact same meaning as above and they are equally useful on the testnet too please see above for their explanations if youve skipped to here specifying the testnet flag however will reconfigure your geth instance a bit instead of using the default data directory ethereum on linux for example geth will nest itself one level deeper into a testnet subfolder ethereum testnet on linux note on osx and linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom endpoint since geth attach will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default e g geth attach datadir testnet geth ipc windows users are not affected by this instead of connecting the main ethereum network the client will connect to the test network which uses different p2p bootnodes different network ids and genesis states note although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing over between the main network and test network you should make sure to always use separate accounts for play money and real money unless you manually move accounts geth will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them full node on the rinkeby test network the above test network is a cross client one based on the ethash proof of work consensus algorithm as such it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization attacks due to the networks low difficulty security go ethereum also supports connecting to a proof of authority based test network called rinkeby operated by members of the community this network is lighter more secure but is only supported by go ethereum geth rinkeby console configuration as an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the geth binary you can also pass a configuration file via geth config path to your config toml to get an idea how the file should look like you can use the dumpconfig subcommand to export your existing configuration geth your favourite flags dumpconfig note this works only with geth v1 6 0 and above docker quick start one of the quickest ways to get ethereum up and running on your machine is by using docker docker run d name ethereum node v users alice ethereum root \ p 8545 8545 p 30303 30303 \ ethereum client go this will start geth in fast sync mode with a db memory allowance of 1gb just as the above command does it will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports there is also an alpine tag available for a slim version of the image do not forget rpcaddr 0 0 0 0 if you want to access rpc from other containers and or hosts by default geth binds to the local interface and rpc endpoints is not accessible from the outside programatically interfacing geth nodes as a developer sooner rather than later youll want to start interacting with geth and the ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console to aid this geth has built in support for a json rpc based apis standard apis and geth specific apis these can be exposed via http websockets and ipc unix sockets on unix based platforms and named pipes on windows the ipc interface is enabled by default and exposes all the apis supported by geth whereas the http and ws interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of apis due to security reasons these can be turned on off and configured as youd expect http based json rpc api options rpc enable the http rpc server rpcaddr http rpc server listening interface default localhost rpcport http rpc server listening port default 8545 rpcapi apis offered over the http rpc interface default eth net web3 rpccorsdomain comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests browser enforced ws enable the ws rpc server wsaddr ws rpc server listening interface default localhost wsport ws rpc server listening port default 8546 wsapi apis offered over

debug eth miner net personal shh txpool web3 ipcpath filename for ipc socket pipe within the datadir explicit paths escape it youll need to use your own programming environments capabilities libraries tools etc to connect via http ws or ipc to a geth node configured with the above flags and youll need to speak json rpc on all transports you can reuse the same connection for multiple requests note please understand the security implications of opening up an http ws based transport before doing so hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert ethereum nodes with exposed apis further all browser tabs can access locally running webservers so malicious webpages could try to subvert locally available apis operating a private network maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for granted in the official networks need to be manually set up defining the private genesis state first youll need to create the genesis state of your networks which all nodes need to be aware of and agree upon this consists of a small json file e g call it genesis json json config chainid 0 homesteadblock 0 eip155block 0 eip158block 0 alloc coinbase 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 difficulty 0x20000 extradata gaslimit 0x2fefd8 nonce 0x0000000000000042 mixhash 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 parenthash

you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able to connect to you if youd like to pre fund some accounts for easier testing you can populate the alloc field with account configs json alloc

every geth node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly set geth init path to genesis json creating the rendezvous point with all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state youll need to start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and or over the internet the clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode bootnode genkey boot key bootnode nodekey boot key with the bootnode online it will display an enode url that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information make sure to replace the displayed ip address information most probably with your externally accessible ip to get the actual enode url note you could also use a full fledged geth node as a bootnode but its the less recommended way starting up your member nodes with the bootnode operational and externally reachable you can try telnet ip port to ensure its indeed reachable start every subsequent geth node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the bootnodes flag it will probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated so do also specify a custom datadir flag geth datadir path to custom data folder bootnodes bootnode enode url from above note since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks youll also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you running a private miner mining on the public ethereum network is a complex task as its only feasible using gpus requiring an opencl or cuda enabled ethminer instance for information on such a setup please consult the ethermining subreddit and the genoil miner repository in a private network setting however a single cpu miner instance is more than enough for practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals without needing heavy resources consider running on a single thread no need for multiple ones either to start a geth instance for mining run it with all your usual flags extended by geth usual flags mine minerthreads 1 etherbase 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single cpu thread crediting all proceedings to the account specified by etherbase you can further tune the mining by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to targetgaslimit and the price transactions are accepted at gasprice contribution thank you for considering to help out with the source code we welcome contributions from anyone on the internet and
