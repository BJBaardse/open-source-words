cadvisor cadvisor container advisor provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers it is a running daemon that collects aggregates processes and exports information about running containers specifically for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters historical resource usage histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics this data is exported by container and machine wide cadvisor has native support for docker containers and should support just about any other container type out of the box we strive for support across the board so feel free to open an issue if that is not the case cadvisors container abstraction is based on lmctfys so containers are inherently nested hierarchically quick start running cadvisor in a docker container to quickly tryout cadvisor on your machine with docker we have a docker image that includes everything you need to get started you can run a single cadvisor to monitor the whole machine simply run sudo docker run \ volume rootfs ro \ volume var run var run rw \ volume sys sys ro \ volume var lib docker var lib docker ro \ volume dev disk dev disk ro \ publish 8080 8080 \ detach true \ name cadvisor \ google cadvisor latest cadvisor is now running in the background on http localhost 8080 the setup includes directories with docker state cadvisor needs to observe note if youre running on centos fedora rhel or are using lxc take a look at our running instructions we have detailed instructions on running cadvisor standalone outside of docker cadvisor running options may also be interesting for advanced usecases if you want to build your own cadvisor docker image see our deployment page for kubernetes users cadvisor can be run as a daemonset see the instructions for how to get started and for how to kustomize it to fit your needs building and testing see the more detailed instructions in the build page this includes instructions for building and deploying the cadvisor docker image exporting stats cadvisor supports exporting stats to various storage plugins see the documentation for more details and examples web ui cadvisor exposes a web ui at its port http hostname port see the documentation for more details remote rest api clients cadvisor exposes its raw and processed stats via a versioned remote rest api see the apis documentation for more information there is also an official go client implementation in the client directory see the documentation for more information roadmap cadvisor aims to improve the resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers today we gather and expose this information to users in our roadmap advise on the performance of a container e g when it is being negatively affected by another when it is not receiving the resources it requires etc auto tune the performance of the container based on previous advise provide usage prediction to cluster schedulers and orchestration layers community contributions questions and comments are all welcomed and encouraged cadvisor developers hang out on slack in the sig node channel get an invitation here we also have the kubernetes users google groups mailing list
