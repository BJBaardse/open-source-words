machine learning notebooks this project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of machine learning in python it contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my oreilly book hands on machine learning with scikit learn and tensorflow simply open the jupyter notebooks you are interested in using jupyter orgs notebook viewer note github coms notebook viewer also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly or by cloning this repository and running jupyter locally this option lets you play around with the code in this case follow the installation instructions below installation first you will need to install git if you dont have it already next clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing the following commands cd home or any other development directory you prefer git clone https github com ageron handson ml git cd handson ml if you do not want to install git you can instead download master zip unzip it rename the resulting directory to handson ml and move it to your development directory if you want to go through chapter 16 on reinforcement learning you will need to install openai gym and its dependencies for atari simulations if you are familiar with python and you know how to install python libraries go ahead and install the libraries listed in requirements txt and jump to the starting jupyter section if you need detailed instructions please read on python required libraries of course you obviously need python python 2 is already preinstalled on most systems nowadays and sometimes even python 3 you can check which version s you have by typing the following commands python version for python 2 python3 version for python 3 any python 3 version should be fine preferably ≥3 5 if you dont have python 3 i recommend installing it python ≥2 6 should work but it is deprecated so python 3 is preferable to do so you have several options on windows or macosx you can just download it from python org on macosx you can alternatively use macports or homebrew if you are using python 3 6 on macosx you need to run the following command to install the certifi package of certificates because python 3 6 on macosx has no certificates to validate ssl connections see this stackoverflow question applications python\ 3 6 install\ certificates command on linux unless you know what you are doing you should use your systems packaging system for example on debian or ubuntu type sudo apt get update sudo apt get install python3 another option is to download and install anaconda this is a package that includes both python and many scientific libraries you should prefer the python 3 version if you choose to use anaconda read the next section or else jump to the using pip section using anaconda when using anaconda you can optionally create an isolated python environment dedicated to this project this is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project e g one for this project with potentially different libraries and library versions conda create n mlbook python 3 5 anaconda source activate mlbook this creates a fresh python 3 5 environment called mlbook you can change the name if you want to and it activates it this environment contains all the scientific libraries that come with anaconda this includes all the libraries we will need numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter and a few others except for tensorflow so lets install it conda install n mlbook c conda forge tensorflow this installs the latest version of tensorflow available for anaconda which is usually not the latest tensorflow version in the mlbook environment fetching it from the conda forge repository if you chose not to create an mlbook environment then just remove the n mlbook option next you can optionally install jupyter extensions these are useful to have nice tables of contents in the notebooks but they are not required conda install n mlbook c conda forge jupyter contrib nbextensions you are all set next jump to the starting jupyter section using pip if you are not using anaconda you need to install several scientific python libraries that are necessary for this project in particular numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter and tensorflow and a few others for this you can either use pythons integrated packaging system pip or you may prefer to use your systems own packaging system if available e g on linux or on macosx when using macports or homebrew the advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated python environments with different libraries and different library versions e g one environment for each project the advantage of using your systems packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your python libraries and your systems other packages since i have many projects with different library requirements i prefer to use pip with isolated environments moreover the pip packages are usually the most recent ones available while anaconda and system packages often lag behind a bit these are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries note in all the following commands if you chose to use python 2 rather than python 3 you must replace pip3 with pip and python3 with python first you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed pip3 install user upgrade pip the user option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user if you prefer to install it system wide i e for all users you must have administrator rights e g use sudo pip3 instead of pip3 on linux and you should remove the user option the same is true of the command below that uses the user option next you can optionally create an isolated environment this is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project e g one for this project with potentially very different libraries and different versions pip3 install user upgrade virtualenv virtualenv p which python3 env this creates a new directory called env in the current directory containing an isolated python environment based on python 3 if you installed multiple versions of python 3 on your system you can replace which python3 with the path to the python executable you prefer to use now you must activate this environment you will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment source env bin activate next use pip to install the required python packages if you are not using virtualenv you should add the user option alternatively you could install the libraries system wide but this will probably require administrator rights e g using sudo pip3 instead of pip3 on linux pip3 install upgrade r requirements txt great youre all set you just need to start jupyter now starting jupyter if you want to use the jupyter extensions optional they are mainly useful to have nice tables of contents you first need to install them jupyter contrib nbextension install user then you can activate an extension such as the table of contents 2 extension jupyter nbextension enable toc2 main okay you can now start jupyter simply type jupyter notebook this should open up your browser and you should see jupyters tree view with the contents of the current directory if your browser does not open automatically visit localhost 8888 click on index ipynb to get started note you can also visit http localhost 8888 nbextensions to activate and configure jupyter extensions congrats you are ready to learn machine learning hands on contributors
