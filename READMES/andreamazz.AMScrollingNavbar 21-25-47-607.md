a custom uinavigationcontroller that enables the scrolling of the navigation bar alongside the scrolling of an observed content view versioning notes version 2 x is written as a subclass of uinavigationcontroller in swift version 2 0 0 introduce swift 2 0 syntax version 3 0 0 introduce swift 3 0 syntax version 4 0 0 introduce swift 4 0 syntax if you are looking for the category implementation in objective c make sure to checkout version 1 x and prior although the 2 x is recomended screenshot setup with cocoapods pod amscrollingnavbar use frameworks setup with carthage github andreamazz amscrollingnavbar usage make sure to use scrollingnavigationcontroller instead of the standard uinavigationcontroller either set the class of your uinavigationcontroller in your storyboard or create programmatically a scrollingnavigationcontroller instance in your code use followscrollview delay to start following the scrolling of a scrollable view e g a uiscrollview or uitableview swift swift override func viewwillappear animated bool super viewwillappear animated if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller followscrollview tableview delay 50 0 objective c objc void viewwillappear bool animated super viewwillappear animated scrollingnavigationcontroller self navigationcontroller followscrollview self tableview delay 50 0f use stopfollowingscrollview to stop the behaviour remember to call this function on disappear swift override func viewdiddisappear animated bool super viewdiddisappear animated if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller stopfollowingscrollview scrollingnavigationviewcontroller to dry things up you can let your view controller subclass scrollingnavigationviewcontroller which provides the base setup implementation you will just need to call followscrollview delay swift override func viewwillappear animated bool super viewwillappear animated if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller followscrollview tableview delay 50 0 followers to move another view like a toolbar alongside the navigation bar you can provide the view or multiple views as the followers parameter since you might want to have the follower up or down youll have to specify the scroll direction of the view once it starts to follow the navigation bar swift if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller followscrollview tableview delay 50 0 followers navigationbarfollower view customfooter direction scrolldown note that when navigating away from the controller the followers might keep the scroll offset refer to handling navigation for proper setup scrolling the tabbar you can also pass a uitabbar in the followers array swift if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller followscrollview tableview delay 50 0 followers tabbarcontroller tabbar scrollingnavigationcontrollerdelegate you can set a delegate to receive a call when the state of the navigation bar changes swift if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller scrollingnavbardelegate self delegate function swift func scrollingnavigationcontroller controller scrollingnavigationcontroller didchangestate state navigationbarstate switch state case collapsed print navbar collapsed case expanded print navbar expanded case scrolling print navbar is moving handling navigation if the view controller with the scroll view pushes new controllers you should call shownavbar animated in your viewwilldisappear animated swift override func viewwilldisappear animated bool super viewwilldisappear animated if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller shownavbar animated true scrolling to top when the user taps the status bar by default a scrollable view scrolls to the top of its content if you want to also show the navigation bar make sure to include this in your controller swift func scrollviewshouldscrolltotop scrollview uiscrollview bool if let navigationcontroller navigationcontroller as scrollingnavigationcontroller navigationcontroller shownavbar animated true return true scroll speed you can control the speed of the scrolling using the scrollspeedfactor optional parameter swift controller followscrollview view delay 0 scrollspeedfactor 2
