refluxjs a simple library for unidirectional dataflow architecture inspired by reactjs flux installation you can currently install the package as a npm package a bower component or import it from a cdn npm the following command installs refluxjs as a npm package npm install reflux then in your script you can gain a reference to refluxjs like so var reflux require reflux bower the following command installs reflux as a bower component that can be used in the browser bower install reflux then the files may be imported into your html file via bower components reflux dist reflux js or bower components reflux dist reflux min js at that point a reflux variable will be globally available to you it is suggested that you import refluxjs after react cdn refluxjs is available at jsdelivr you may import the cdn files directly through a script tag at that point a reflux variable will be globally available to you it is suggested that you import refluxjs after react overview the main function of reflux is to introduce a more functional programming style architecture by eschewing mvc like pattern and adopting a single data flow pattern ¦ actions ¦ ¦ stores ¦ ¦ view components ¦ ¦ the pattern is composed of actions and data stores where actions initiate new data to pass through data stores before coming back to the view components again if a view component has an event that needs to make a change in the applications data stores they need to do so by signaling to the stores through the actions available usage for usage you need to create actions which can be called from react components those actions are listened to by stores which hold and update data in turn those stores are hooked up to react components and set state within them as it is updated within the store therefore the 3 main concepts to know are creating actions creating stores hooking stores to react components creating actions create an action by calling reflux createaction with an optional options object javascript var statusupdate reflux createaction an action is a function object that can be invoked like any other function javascript statusupdate data invokes the action statusupdate there is also a convenience function for creating multiple actions javascript var actions reflux createactions statusupdate statusedited statusadded actions object now contains the actions with the names given in the array above that may be invoked as usual actions statusupdate more on actions actions can also load files asynchronously with child actions do preemit and shouldemit checking have many shortcuts for easy usage see reflux action documentation for more creating stores create a data store much like reactjss own react component by creating a class extending reflux store the store has a state property much like a component and uses setstate like a component as well you may set up all action listeners in the constructor and register them by calling the stores own listento function javascript class statusstore extends reflux store constructor super this state flag offline set stores default state much like in react this listento statusupdate this onstatusupdate listen to the statusupdate action onstatusupdate status var newflag status online offline this setstate flag newflag in the above example whenever the action statusupdate is called the stores onstatusupdate callback will be called with whatever parameters were sent in the action e g if the action is called as statusupdate true then the status argument in the onstatusupdate function is true stores also integrate easily with sets of actions via things like this listenables when an actions object or an array of multiple actions objects is applied to this listenables you may automatically add listeners simply by naming convention just name the functions either after the action name such as actionname or the camelcased action name preceded with on such as onactionname javascript var actions reflux createactions firstaction secondaction class statusstore extends reflux store constructor super this listenables actions onfirstaction calls on actions firstaction onsecondaction calls on actions secondaction more on stores reflux stores are very powerful they can even do things like contribute to a global state that can be read and set for partial or full state time travel debugging etc see reflux store documentation to learn more about stores hooking stores to components once youve created actions and stores now the last step in working refluxjs is to hook those stores to a react component this is done as simply as extending reflux component instead of react component and setting the store s to use reflux component itself extends react component so you use them the exact same way the only difference is that reflux component allows you to set stores for the component to get state from javascript class mycomponent extends reflux component constructor props super props this state our store will add its own state to the components this store statusstore just assign the store class itself render var flag this state flag flag is mixed in from the statusstore return div user is flag div when the component mounts it will either create a singleton instance of statusstore if one isnt already made or use an already made singleton if it was already created by another component that uses the store of important note is that you can set multiple stores by setting this stores the plural and setting it to an array of store classes set a this storekeys array to restrict only certain parts of the store being mixed into the component state there is also a mapstoretostate method in the documentation for those that want absolute control over how a stores state is mapped to a component javascript class mycomponent extends reflux component constructor props super props this state type admin note that we can still use normal state this stores statusstore anotherstore this storekeys flag info render var flag this state flag var info this state info var type this state type return div user is flag info info type type div the above will mix in properties from the state of both statusstore and anotherstore however because of this storekeys it will only mix in the properties flag and info from them so any other properties within those stores will not get mixed in so even if a store contained a type property in its state it would not get mixed in and the type value we set as a normal part of the component state is safe more on using reflux style components refluxs simple and intuitive way of integrating stores into components is easy and powerful you can aggregate stores together on a component by component basis filter which parts of the stores come through and which dont or even do a detailed manual mapping of exactly how you want the state from stores to map to the state in a particular component see reflux style component documentation to learn more
