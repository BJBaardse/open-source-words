webrtc experiments demos it is a repository of uniquely experimented webrtc demos written by muaz khan no special requirement just webrtc compatible web browser e g chrome firefox opera on desktop android these demos experiments are mostly client side i e no server installation needed you can use all these demos in php python ruby asp net etc since they are only relying on javascript and 3rd party services how to use each demo has a unique directory simply download that directory upload in your webserver and use it and itll work you dont need to modify any single line to use it no single installation or modification is needed detectrtc is webrtc supported in your browser a tiny javascript library that can be used to detect webrtc features e g system having speakers microphone or webcam screen capturing is supported number of audio video devices etc live demo https www webrtc experiment com detectrtc github open sourced https github com muaz khan detectrtc recordrtc webrtc
