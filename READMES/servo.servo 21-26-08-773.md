the servo parallel browser engine project servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the rust language it is currently developed on 64 bit macos 64 bit linux 64 bit windows and android servo welcomes contribution from everyone see contributing md and hacking quickstart md for help getting started visit the servo project page for news and guides setting up your environment rustup rs building servo requires rustup version 1 8 0 or more recent if you have an older version run rustup self update to install on windows download and run rustup init exe then follow the onscreen instructions to install on other systems run sh curl https sh rustup rs ssf sh this will also download the current stable version of rust which servo wont use to skip that step run instead curl https sh rustup rs ssf sh s default toolchain none see also other installation methods other dependencies please select your operating system macos debian based linuxes fedora arch linux opensuse gentoo linux microsoft windows android macos on macos homebrew sh brew install automake pkg config python cmake yasm pip install virtualenv on macos macports sh sudo port install python27 py27 virtualenv

x86 64 msi installer is fine you should change the installation to install the add python exe to path feature install virtualenv in a normal windows shell cmd exe or command prompt from the start menu do pip install virtualenv if this does not work you may need to reboot for the changed path settings by the python installer to take effect install git for windows https git scm com download win do allow it to add git exe to the path default settings for the installer are fine install visual studio community 2017 https www visualstudio com vs community you must add visual c to the list of installed components it is not on by default visual studio 2017 must installed to the default location or mach bat will not find it if you encountered errors with the environment above do the following for a workaround 1 download and install build tools for visual studio 2017 2 install python2 7 x86 x64 and virtualenv 3 run mach bat build d if you have troubles with x64 type prompt as mach bat set by default 1 you may need to choose and launch the type manually such as x86 x64 cross tools command prompt for vs 2017 in the windows menu 2 cd to the path servo 3 python mach build d cross compilation for android run mach bootstrap android to get android specific tools see wiki for details the rust compiler servos build system uses rustup rs to automatically download a rust compiler this is a specific version of rust nightly determined by the rust toolchain file building servo is built with cargo the rust package manager we also use mozillas mach tools to orchestrate the build and other tasks normal build to build servo in development mode this is useful for development but the resulting binary is very slow sh git clone https github com servo servo cd servo mach build dev mach run tests html about mozilla html or on windows msvc in a normal command prompt cmd exe cmd git clone https github com servo servo cd servo mach bat build dev for benchmarking performance testing or real world use add the release flag to create an optimized build sh mach build release mach run release tests html about mozilla html checking for build errors without building if youre making changes to one crate that cause build errors in another crate consider this instead of a full build sh mach check it will run cargo check which runs the analysis phase of the compiler and so shows build errors if any but skips the code generation phase this can be a lot faster than a full build though of course it doesnt produce a binary you can run building for android target for arm armv7 linux androideabi most phones sh mach build release android mach package release android for x86 typically for the emulator sh mach build release target i686 linux android mach package release target
