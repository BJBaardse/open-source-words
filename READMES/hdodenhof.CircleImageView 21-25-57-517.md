circleimageview a fast circular imageview perfect for profile images this is based on roundedimageview from vince mi which itself is based on techniques recommended by romain guy it uses a bitmapshader and does not create a copy of the original bitmap use a clippath which is neither hardware accelerated nor anti aliased use setxfermode to clip the bitmap which means drawing twice to the canvas as this is just a custom imageview and not a custom drawable or a combination of both it can be used with all kinds of drawables i e a picassodrawable from picasso or other non standard drawables needs some testing though gradle dependencies implementation de hdodenhof circleimageview 2 2 0 usage xml de hdodenhof circleimageview circleimageview xmlns app http schemas android com apk res auto android id id profile image android layout width 96dp android layout height 96dp android src drawable profile app civ border width 2dp app civ border color ff000000 limitations the scaletype is always center crop and youll get an exception if you try to change it this is currently by design as its perfectly fine for profile images enabling adjustviewbounds is not supported as this requires an unsupported scaletype if you use an image loading library like picasso or glide you need to disable their fade animations to avoid messed up images for picasso use the nofade option for glide use dontanimate if you want to keep the fadein animation you have to fetch the image into a target and apply a custom animation yourself when receiving the bitmap using a transitiondrawable with circleimageview doesnt work properly and leads to messed up images faq how can i use a vectordrawable with circleimageview short answer you shouldnt using a vectordrawable with circleimageview is very inefficient you should modify your vectors to be in a circular shape and use them with a regular imageview instead why doesnt circleimageview extend appcompatimageview extending appcompatimageview would require adding a runtime dependency for the support library without any real benefit how can i add a selector e g ripple effect bound to a circle theres currently no direct support for a circle bound selector but you can follow these steps to implement it yourself how can i add a gap between image and border adding a gap is also not support directly but theres a workaround changelog next limit touch event handling to circle area 2 2 0 add support for elevation add circle background color attribute to replace fill color 2 1 0 add support for padding add option to disable circular transformation fix hairline gap being drawn between image and border under some conditions fix npe when using tint attribute which is not supported deprecate fill color as it seems to cause quite some confusion 2 0 0 breaking custom xml attributes are now prefixed with civ graceful handling of incompatible drawables add support for a fill color shown behind images with transparent areas fix dimension calculation issues with small images fix bitmap not being cleared when set to null 1 3 0 add setbordercolorresource int resid add resource type annotations add border overlay attribute to allow drawing border on top of the base image 1 2 2 add colorfilter support 1 2 1 fix colordrawables not being rendered properly on lollipop 1 2 0 add support for setimageuri uri uri fix view not being initialized when using circleimageview context context 1 1 1 fix border being shown although border width is set to 0 1 1 0 add support for colordrawables add getters and setters for border color and border width 1 0 1 prevent crash due to outofmemoryerror 1 0 0 initial release license copyright 2014 2018 henning dodenhof licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
