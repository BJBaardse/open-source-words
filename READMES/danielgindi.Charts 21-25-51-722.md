version 3 1 1 synced to mpandroidchart f6a398b just a heads up charts 3 0 has some breaking changes please read the release migration notes another heads up chartsrealm is now in a separate repo pods is also now charts and chartsrealm instead of charts core and charts realm xcode 9 3 swift 4 1 ios 8 0 use as an embedded framework tvos 9 0 macos 10 11 okay so theres this beautiful library called mpandroidchart by philipp jahoda which has become very popular amongst android developers and in the meanwhile theres no decent charting solution for ios ive chosen to write it in swift as it can be highly optimized by the compiler and can be used in both swift and objc project the demo project is written in objc to demonstrate how it works an amazing feature of this library now for android ios tvos and macos is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms as the learning curve is singleton it happens only once and the code stays very similar so developers dont have to go around and re invent the app to produce the same output with a different library and thats not even considering the fact that theres not really another good choice out there currently having trouble running the demo chartsdemo chartsdemo xcodeproj is the demo project for ios tvos chartsdemo osx chartsdemo osx xcodeproj is the demo project for macos make sure you are running a supported version of xcode usually it is specified here a few lines above in most cases it will be the latest xcode version make sure that your project supports swift 3 0 optional run carthage checkout in the project folder to fetch dependencies i e testing dependencies if you dont have carthage you can get it here usage in order to correctly compile drag the charts xcodeproj to your project go to your targets settings hit the under the embedded binaries section and select the charts framework import charts when using swift in an objc project you need to import your bridging header usually it is yourproject swift h so in chartsdemo its chartsdemo swift h do not try to actually include chartsdemo swift h in your project xcode 8 1 and earlier under build options mark embedded content contains swift code xcode 8 2 under build options mark always embed swift standard libraries when using realm io note that the realm framework is not linked with charts it is only there for optional bindings which means that you need to have the framework in your project and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with charts we will do our best to always compile against the latest version youll need to add chartsrealm as a dependency too 3rd party tutorials using realm and charts with swift 3 in ios 10 sami korpela creating a line chart in swift 3 and ios 10 osian smith beginning set up and example using charts with swift 3 want your tutorial to show here create a pr troubleshooting cant compile please note the difference between installing a compiled framework from cocoapods or carthage and copying the source code please read the usage section again search in the issues try to politely ask in the issues section other problems feature requests search in the issues try to politely ask in the issues section cocoapods install add pod charts to your podfile charts is the name of the library for realm support please add pod chartsrealm too note pod ios charts is not the correct library and refers to a different project by someone else carthage install charts now include carthage prebuilt binaries carthage github danielgindi charts 3 1 1 github danielgindi charts 3 1 1 in order to build the binaries for a new release use carthage build no skip current carthage archive charts 3rd party bindings xamarin by flash3001 ios github nuget android github nuget help if you like what you see here and want to support the work being done in this repository you could contribute code issues and pull requests let people know this library exists fire spread the word fire you can buy me a beer or you can buy me dinner note the author of mpandroidchart is the reason that this library exists and is accepting donations on his page he deserves them questions issues if you are having
