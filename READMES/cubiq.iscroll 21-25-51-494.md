iscroll smooth scrolling for the web iscroll is a high performance small footprint dependency free multi platform javascript scroller it works on desktop mobile and smart tv it has been vigorously optimized for performance and size so to offer the smoothest result on modern and old devices alike iscroll does not just scroll it can handle any element that needs to be moved with user interaction it adds scrolling zooming panning infinite scrolling parallax scrolling carousels to your projects and manages to do that in just 4kb give it a broom and it will also clean up your office even on platforms where native scrolling is good enough iscroll adds features that wouldnt be possible otherwise specifically granular control over the scroll position even during momentum you can always get and set the x y coordinates of the scroller animation can be customized with user defined easing functions bounce elastic back you can easily hook to a plethora of custom events onbeforescrollstart onscrollstart onscroll onscrollend flick out of the box multi platform support from older android devices to the latest iphone from chrome to internet explorer the many faces of iscroll iscroll is all about optimization to reach the highest performance it has been divided into multiple versions you can pick the version that better suits your need currently we have the following fragrances iscroll js it is the general purpose script it includes the most commonly used features and grants very high performance in a small footprint iscroll lite js it is a stripped down version of the main script it doesnt support snap scrollbars mouse wheel key bindings but if all you need is scrolling especially on mobile iscroll lite is the smallest fastest solution iscroll probe js probing the current scroll position is a demanding task thats why i decided to build a dedicated version for it if you need to know the scrolling position at any given time this is the iscroll for you im making some more tests this might end up in the regular iscroll js script so keep an eye on it iscroll zoom js adds zooming to the standard scroll iscroll infinite js can do infinite and cached scrolling handling very long lists of elements is no easy task for mobile devices iscroll infinite uses a caching mechanism that lets you scroll a potentially infinite number of elements getting started so you want to be an iscroll master cool because that is what ill make you into the best way to learn the iscroll is by looking at the demos in the archive youll find a demo folder stuffed with examples most of the script features are outlined there iscroll is a class that needs to be initiated for each scrolling area theres no limit to the number of iscrolls you can have in each page if not that imposed by the device cpu memory try to keep the dom as simple as possible iscroll uses the hardware compositing layer but theres a limit to the elements the hardware can handle the optimal html structure is html div id wrapper ul li li li li ul div iscroll must be applied to the wrapper of the scrolling area in the above example the ul element will be scrolled only the first child of the container element is scrolled additional children are simply ignored box shadow opacity text shadow and alpha channels are all properties that dont go very well together with hardware acceleration scrolling might look good with few elements but as soon as your dom becomes more complex youll start experiencing lag and jerkiness sometimes a background image to simulate the shadow performs better than box shadow the bottom line is experiment with css properties youll be surprised by the difference in performance a small css change can do the minimal call to initiate the script is as follow html script type text javascript var myscroll new iscroll wrapper script the first parameter can be a string representing the dom selector of the scroll container element or a reference to the element itself the following is a valid syntax too js var wrapper document getelementbyid wrapper var myscroll new iscroll wrapper so basically either you pass the element directly or a string that will be given to queryselector consequently to select a wrapper by its class name instead of the id youd do js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper note that iscroll uses queryselector not queryselectorall so only the first occurrence of the selector is used if you need to apply iscroll to multiple objects youll have to build your own cycle you dont strictly need to assign the instance to a variable myscroll but it is handy to keep a reference to the iscroll for example you could later check the scroller position or unload unnecessary events when you dont need the iscroll anymore initialization the iscroll needs to be initiated when the dom is ready the safest bet is to start it on window onload event domcontentloaded or inline initialization are also fine but remember that the script needs to know the height width of the scrolling area if you have images that dont have explicit width height declaration iscroll will most likely end up with a wrong scroller size add position relative or absolute to the scroll container the wrapper that alone usually solves most of the problems with wrongly calculated wrapper dimensions to sum up the smallest iscroll configuration is html head script type text javascript src iscroll js script script type text javascript var myscroll function loaded myscroll new iscroll wrapper script head body onload loaded div id wrapper ul li li li li ul div body refer to the barebone example for more details on the minimal css html requirements if you have a complex dom it is sometimes smart to add a little delay from the onload event to iscroll initialization executing the iscroll with a 100 or 200 milliseconds delay gives the browser that little rest that can save your ass configuring the iscroll iscroll can be configured by passing a second parameter during the initialization phase js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper mousewheel true scrollbars true the example above turns on mouse wheel support and scrollbars after initialization you can access the normalized values from the options object eg js console dir myscroll options the above will return the configuration the myscroll instance will run on by normalized i mean that if you set usetransform true for example but the browser doesnt support css transforms usetransform will be false understanding the core iscroll uses various techniques to scroll based on device browser capability normally you dont need to configure the engine iscroll is smart enough to pick the best for you nonetheless it is important to understand which mechanisms iscroll works on and how to configure them options usetransform by default the engine uses the transform css property setting this to false scrolls like we were in 2007 ie using the top left and thus the scroller needs to be absolutely positioned this might be useful when scrolling sensitive content such as flash iframes and videos but be warned performance loss is huge default true options usetransition iscroll uses css transition to perform animations momentum and bounce by setting this to false requestanimationframe is used instead on modern browsers the difference is barely noticeable on older devices transitions perform better default true options hwcompositing this option tries to put the scroller on the hardware layer by appending translatez 0 to the transform css property this greatly increases performance especially on mobile but there are situations where you might want to disable it notably if you have too many elements and the hardware cant catch up default true if unsure leave iscroll decide whats the optimal config for best performance all the above options should be set to true or better leave them undefined as they are set to true automatically you may try to play with them in case you encounter hiccups and memory leaks basic features options bounce when the scroller meets the boundary it performs a small bounce animation disabling bounce may help reach smoother results on old or slow devices default true options click to override the native scrolling iscroll has to inhibit some default browser behaviors such as mouse clicks if you want your application to respond to the click event you have to explicitly set this option to true please note that it is suggested to use the custom tap event instead see below default false options disablemouseoptions disablepointeroptions disabletouch by default iscroll listens to all pointer events and reacts to the first one that occurs it may seem a waste of resources but feature detection has proven quite unreliable and this listen to all approach is our safest bet for wide browser device compatibility if you have an internal mechanism for device detection or you know in advance where your script will run on you may want to disable all event sets you dont need mouse pointer or touch events for example to disable mouse and pointer events js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper disablemouse true disablepointer true default false options eventpassthrough sometimes you want to preserve native vertical scroll but being able to add an horizontal iscroll maybe a carousel set this to true and the iscroll area will react to horizontal swipes only vertical swipes will naturally scroll the whole page see event passthrough demo on a mobile device note that this can be set to horizontal to inverse the behavior native horizontal scroll vertical iscroll options freescroll this is useful mainly on 2d scrollers when you need to scroll both horizontally and vertically normally when you start scrolling in one direction the other is locked sometimes you just want to move freely with no constrains in these cases you can set this option to true see 2d scroll demo default false options keybindings set this to true to activate keyboard and remote controls interaction see the key bindings section below for more information default false options invertwheeldirection meaningful when mouse wheel support is activated in which case it just inverts the scrolling direction ie going down scrolls up and vice versa default false options momentum you can turn on off the momentum animation performed when the user quickly flicks on screen turning this off greatly enhances performance default true options mousewheel listen to the mouse wheel event default false options preventdefault whether or not to preventdefault when events are fired this should be left true unless you really know what you are doing see preventdefaultexception in the advanced options for more control over the preventdefault behavior default true options scrollbars wheter or not to display the default scrollbars see more in the scrollbar section default false options scrollxoptions scrolly by default only vertical scrolling is enabled if you need to scroll horizontally you have to set scrollx to true see horizontal demo see also the freescroll option default scrollx false scrolly true note that scrollx y true has the same effect as overflow auto setting one direction to false helps to spare some checks and thus cpu cycles options startxoptions starty by default iscroll starts at 0 0 top left position you can instruct the scroller to kickoff at a different location default 0 options tap set this to true to let iscroll emit a custom tap event when the scroll area is clicked tapped but not scrolled this is the suggested way to handle user interaction with clickable elements to listen to the tap event you would add an event listener as you would do for a standard event example js element addeventlistener tap dosomething false \\ native element on tap dosomething \\ jquery you can also customize the event name by passing a string eg js tap mycustomtapevent in this case youd listen to mycustomtapevent default false scrollbars the scrollbars are more than just what the name suggests in fact internally they are referenced as indicators an indicator listens to the scroller position and normally it just shows its position in relation to whole but what it can do is so much more lets start with the basis options scrollbars as we mentioned in the basic features section theres only one thing that you got to do to activate the scrollbars in all their splendor and that one thing is js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper scrollbars true of course the default behavior can be personalized options fadescrollbars when not in use the scrollbar fades away leave this to false to spare resources default false options interactivescrollbars the scrollbar becomes draggable and user can interact with it default false options resizescrollbars the scrollbar size changes based on the proportion between the wrapper and the scroller width height setting this to false makes the scrollbar a fixed size this might be useful in case of custom styled scrollbars see below default true options shrinkscrollbars when scrolling outside of the boundaries the scrollbar is shrunk by a small amount valid values are clip and scale clip just moves the indicator outside of its container the impression is that the scrollbar shrinks but it is simply moving out of the screen if you can live with the visual effect this option immensely improves overall performance scale turns off usetransition hence all animations are served with requestanimationframe the indicator is actually varied in size and the end result is nicer to the eye default false note that resizing cant be performed by the gpu so scale is all on the cpu if your application runs on multiple devices my suggestion would be to switch this option to scale clip or false based on the platform responsiveness eg on older mobile devices you could set this to clip and on desktop browser to scale see the scrollbar demo styling the scrollbar so you dont like the default scrollbar styling and you think you could do better help yourself iscroll makes dressing the scrollbar a snap first of all set the scrollbars option to custom js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper scrollbars custom then use the following css classes to style the little bastards iscrollhorizontalscrollbar this is applied to the horizontal container the element that actually hosts the scrollbar indicator iscrollverticalscrollbar same as above but for the vertical container iscrollindicator the actual scrollbar indicator iscrollbothscrollbars this is added to the container elements when both scrollbars are shown normally just one horizontal or vertical is visible the styled scrollbars demo should make things clearer than my lousy explanation if you set resizescrollbars false you could make the scrollbar of a fixed size otherwise it would be resized based on the scroller length please keep reading to the following section for a revelation that will shake your world indicators all the scrollbar options above are in reality just wrappers to the low level indicators option it looks more or less like this js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper indicators el element element selector fade false ignoreboundaries false interactive false listenx true listeny true resize true shrink false speedratiox 0 speedratioy 0 options indicators el this is a mandatory parameter which holds a reference to the scrollbar container element the first child inside the container will be the indicator note that the scrollbar can be anywhere on your document it doesnt need to be inside the scroller wrapper do you start perceiving the power of such tool valid syntax would be js indicators el document getelementbyid indicator or simply js indicators el indicator options indicators ignoreboundaries this tells the indicator to ignore the boundaries imposed by its container since we can alter the speed ratio of the scrollbar it is useful to just let the scrollbar go say you want the indicator to go twice as fast as the scroller it would reach the end of its run very quickly this option is used for parallax scrolling default false options indicators listenxoptions indicators listeny to which axis the indicator listens to it can be just one or both default true options indicators speedratioxoptions indicators speedratioy the speed the indicator moves in relation to the main scroller size by default this is set automatically you rarely need to alter this value default 0 options indicators fadeoptions indicators interactiveoptions indicators resizeoptions indicators shrink these are the same options we explored in the scrollbars section im not going to insult your intelligence and repeat them here do not cross the streams it would be bad do not mix the scrollbars syntax options scrollbars options fadescrollbars options interactivescrollbars with the indicators use one or the other have a look at the minimap demo to get a glance at the power of the indicators option the wittiest of you would have noticed that indicators is actually plural yes exactly passing an array of objects you can have a virtually infinite number of indicators i dont know what you may need them for but hey who am i to argue about your scrollbar preferences parallax scrolling parallax scrolling is just a collateral damage of the indicators functionality an indicator is just a layer that follows the movement and animation applied to the main scroller if you see it like that youll understand the power behind this feature to this add that you can have any number of indicators and the parallax scrolling is served please refer to the parallax demo scrolling programmatically you silly of course you can scroll programmaticaly scrollto x y time easing say your iscroll instance resides into the myscroll variable you can easily scroll to any position with the following syntax js myscroll scrollto 0 100 that would scroll down by 100 pixels remember 0 is always the top left corner to scroll you have to pass negative numbers time and easing are optional they regulates the duration in ms and the easing function of the animation respectively the easing functions are available in the iscroll utils ease object for example to apply a 1 second elastic easing youd do js myscroll scrollto 0 100 1000 iscroll utils ease elastic the available options are quadratic circular back bounce elastic scrollby x y time easing same as above but x and y are relative to the current position js myscroll scrollby 0 10 would scroll 10 pixels down if you are at 100 youll end up at 110 scrolltoelement el time offsetx offsety easing youre gonna like this sit tight the only mandatory parameter is el pass an element or a selector and iscroll will try to scroll to the top left of that element time is optional and sets the animation duration offsetx and offsety define an offset in pixels so that you can scroll to that element plus a the specified offset not only that if you set them to true the element will be centered on screen refer to the scroll to element example easing works the same way as per the scrollto method snap iscroll can snap to fixed positions and elements options snap the simplest snap config is as follow js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper snap true this would automatically split the scroller into pages the size of the container snap also takes a string as a value the string will be the selector to the elements the scroller will be snapped to so the following js var myscroll new iscroll wrapper snap li would snap to each and every li tag to help you navigate through the snap points iscroll grants access to a series of interesting methods gotopage x y time easing x and y represent the page number you want to scroll to in the horizontal or vertical axes yeah its the plural of axis i checked if the scroller in mono dimensional just pass 0 to the axis you dont need time is the duration of the animation easing the easing function used to scroll to the point refer to the option bounceeasing in the advanced options they are both optional js myscroll gotopage 10 0 1000 this would scroll to the 10th page on the horizontal axis in 1 second next prev go to the next and previous page based on current position zoom to use the pinch zoom functionality you better use the iscroll zoom js script options zoom set this to true to activate zoom default false options zoommax maximum zoom level default 4 options zoommin minimum zoom level default 1 options startzoom starting zoom level default 1 options wheelaction wheel action can be set to zoom to have the wheel regulate the zoom level instead of scrolling position default undefined ie the mouse wheel scrolls to sum up a nice zoom config would be js myscroll new iscroll wrapper zoom true mousewheel true wheelaction zoom the zoom is performed with css transform iscroll can zoom only on browsers that support that some browsers notably webkit based ones take a snapshot of the zooming area as soon as they are placed on the hardware compositing layer say as soon as you apply a transform to them this snapshot is used as a texture for the zooming area and it can hardly be updated this means that your texture will be based on elements at scale 1 and zooming in will result in blurred low definition text and images a simple solution is to load content at double or triple its actual resolution and scale it down inside a scale 0 5 div this should be enough to grant you a better result i hope to be able to post more demos soon refer to the zoom demo zoom scale x y time juicy method that lets you zoom programmatically scale is the zoom factor x and y the focus point aka the center of the zoom if not specified the center of the screen will be used time is the duration of the animation in milliseconds optional infinite scrolling iscroll integrates a smart caching system that allows to handle of a virtually infinite amount of data using and reusing just a bunch of elements infinite scrolling is in an early stage of development and although it can be considered stable it is not ready for wide consumption please review the infinite demo and send your suggestions and bug reports i will add more details as soon as the functionality evolves advanced options for the hardcore developer options bindtowrapper the move event is normally bound to the document and not the scroll container when you move the cursor finger out of the wrapper the scrolling keeps going this is usually what you want but you can also bind the move event to wrapper itself doing so as soon as the pointer leaves the container the scroll stops default false options bounceeasing easing function performed during the bounce animation valid values are quadratic circular back bounce elastic see the bounce easing demo drag the scroller down and release bounceeasing is a bit smarter than that you can also feed a custom easing function like so js bounceeasing style cubic bezier 0 0 1 1 fn function k return k the above would perform a linear easing the style option is used every time the animation is executed with css transitions fn is used with requestanimationframe if the easing function is too complex and cant be represented by a cubic bezier just pass empty string asstyle note that bounce and elastic cant be performed by css transitions default circular options bouncetime duration in millisecond of the bounce animation default 600 options deceleration this value can be altered to change the momentum animation duration speed higher numbers make the animation shorter sensible results can be experienced starting with a value of 0 01 bigger than that basically doesnt make any momentum at all default 0 0006 options mousewheelspeed set the speed of the mouse wheel default 20 options preventdefaultexception these are all the exceptions when preventdefault would be fired anyway despite the preventdefault option value this is a pretty powerful option if you dont want to preventdefault on all elements with formfield class name for example you could pass the following js preventdefaultexception classname \s formfield \s default tagname input textarea button select options resizepolling when you resize the window iscroll has to recalculate elements position and dimension this might be a pretty daunting task for the poor little fella to give it some rest the polling is set to 60 milliseconds by reducing this value you get better visual effect but the script becomes more aggressive on the cpu the default value seems a good compromise default 60 mastering the refresh method iscroll needs to know the exact dimensions of both the wrapper and the scroller they are computed at start up but if your elements change in size we need to tell iscroll that you are messing with the dom this is achieved by calling the refresh method with the right timing please follow me closely understanding this will save you hours of frustration every time you touch the dom the browser renderer repaints the page once this repaint has happened we can safely read the new dom properties the repaint phase is not instantaneous and it happens only at the end of the scope that triggered it thats why we need to give the renderer a little rest before refreshing the iscroll to ensure that javascript gets the updated properties you should defer the refresh with something like this js ajax page php oncompletion function oncompletion update here your dom settimeout function myscroll refresh 0 we have placed the refresh call into a zero timeout that is likely all you need to correctly refresh the iscroll boundaries there are other ways to wait for the repaint but the zero timeout has proven pretty solid consider that if you have a very complex html structure you may give the browser some more rest and raise the timeout to 100 or 200 milliseconds this is generally true for all the tasks that have to be done on the dom always give the renderer some rest custom events iscroll also emits some useful custom events you can hook to to register them you use the on type fn method js myscroll new iscroll wrapper myscroll on scrollend dosomething the above code executes the dosomething function every time the content stops scrolling the available types are beforescrollstart executed as soon as user touches the screen but before the scrolling has initiated scrollcancel scroll initiated but didnt happen scrollstart the scroll started scroll the content is scrolling available only in scroll probe js edition see onscroll event scrollend content stopped scrolling flick user flicked left right zoomstart user started zooming zoomend zoom ended onscroll event the scroll event is available on iscroll probe edition only iscroll probe js the probe behavior can be altered through the probetype option options probetype this regulates the probe aggressiveness or the frequency at which the scroll event is fired valid values are 1 2 3 the higher the number the more aggressive the probe the more aggressive the probe the higher the impact on the cpu probetype 1 has no impact on performance the scroll event is fired only when the scroller is not busy doing its stuff probetype 2 always executes the scroll event except during momentum and bounce this resembles the native onscroll event probetype 3 emits the scroll event with a to the pixel precision note that the scrolling is forced to requestanimationframe ie usetransition false please see the probe demo key bindings you can activate support for keyboards and remote controls with the keybindings option by default iscroll listens to the arrow keys page up down home end but they are wait for it totally customizable you can pass an object with the list of key codes you want iscroll to react to the default values are as follow js keybindings pageup 33 pagedown 34 end 35 home 36 left 37 up 38 right 39 down 40 you can also pass a string eg pageup a and iscroll will convert it for you you could just think of a key code and iscroll would read it out of your mind useful scroller info iscroll stores many useful information that you can use to augment your application you will probably find useful myscroll x y current position myscroll directionx y last direction 1 down right 0 still 1 up left myscroll currentpage current snap point info these pieces of information may be useful when dealing with custom events eg js myscroll new iscroll wrapper myscroll on scrollend function if this x 1000 do something the above executes some code if the x position is lower than 1000px when the scroller stops note that i used this instead of myscroll you can use both of course but iscroll passes itself as this context when firing custom event functions destroy the public destroy method can be used to free some memory when the iscroll is not needed anymore js myscroll destroy myscroll null contributing and cla if you want to contribute to the iscroll development before i can accept your submission i have to ask you to sign the contributor license agreement unfortunately that is the only way to enforce the openness of the script as an end user you have to do nothing of course actually the cla ensures that nobody will even come after you asking for your first born for using the iscroll please note that pull requests may take some time to be accepted testing iscroll is one of the most time consuming tasks of the project iscroll works from desktop to smartphone from tablets to smart tvs i do not have physical access to all the testing devices so before i can push a change i have to make sure that the new code is working everywhere critical bugs are usually applied very quickly but enhancements and coding style changes have to pass a longer review phase remember that this is still a side project for me who is using iscroll its impossible to track all the websites and applications that use the iscroll it has been spotted on apple microsoft
