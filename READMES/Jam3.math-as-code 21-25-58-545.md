math as code chinese translation 中文版 this is a reference to ease developers into mathematical notation by showing comparisons with javascript code motivation academic papers can be intimidating for self taught game and graphics programmers this guide is not yet finished if you see errors or want to contribute please open a ticket or send a pr note for brevity some code examples make use of npm packages you can refer to their github repos for implementation details foreword mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author context and the field of study linear algebra set theory etc this guide may not cover all uses of a symbol in some cases real world references blog posts publications etc will be cited to demonstrate how a symbol might appear in the wild for a more complete list refer to wikipedia list of mathematical symbols for simplicity many of the code examples here operate on floating point values and are not numerically robust for more details on why

more variable name conventions there are a variety of naming conventions depending on the context and field of study and they are not always consistent however in some of the literature you may find variable names to follow a pattern like so s italic lowercase letters for scalars e g a number x bold lowercase letters for vectors e g a 2d point a bold uppercase letters for matrices e g a 3d transformation θ italic lowercase greek letters for constants and special variables e g polar angle θ theta this will also be the format of this guide equals symbols there are a number of symbols resembling the equals sign here are a few common examples is for equality values are the same ≠ is for inequality value are not the same ≈ is for approximately equal to π ≈ 3 14159 is for definition a is defined as b in javascript js equality 2 3 inequality 2 3 approximately equal almostequal math pi 3 14159 1e 5 function almostequal a b epsilon return math abs a b epsilon you might see the and symbols being used for definition 1 for example the following defines x to be another name for 2kj x 2kj in javascript we might use var to define our variables and provide aliases js var x 2 k j however this is mutable and only takes a snapshot of the values at that time some languages have pre processor define statements which are closer to a mathematical define a more accurate define in javascript es6 might look a bit like this js const f k j 2 k j the following on the other hand represents equality x 2kj the above equation might be interpreted in code as an assertion js console assert x 2 k j square root and complex numbers a square root operation is of the form \left \sqrt x \right 2 x in programming we use a sqrt function like so js var x 9 console log math sqrt x 3 complex numbers are expressions of the form where is the real part and is the imaginary part the imaginary number is defined as i \sqrt 1 in javascript there is no built in functionality for complex numbers but there are some libraries that support complex number arithmetic for example using mathjs js var math require mathjs var a math complex 3 1 re 3 im 1 var b math sqrt 1 re 0 im 1 console log math multiply a b tostring 1 3i the library also supports evaluating a string expression so the above could be re written as js console log math eval 3 i i tostring 1 3i other implementations immutable complex complex js numeric js dot cross the dot · and cross × symbols have different uses depending on context they might seem obvious but its important to understand the subtle differences before we continue into other sections scalar multiplication both symbols can represent simple multiplication of scalars the following are equivalent 5 \cdot 4 5 \times 4 in programming languages we tend to use asterisk for multiplication js var result 5 4 often the multiplication sign is only used to avoid ambiguity e g between two numbers here we can omit it entirely 3kj if these variables represent scalars the code would be js var result 3 k j vector multiplication to denote multiplication of one vector with a scalar or element wise multiplication of a vector with another vector we typically do not use the dot · or cross × symbols these have different meanings in linear algebra discussed shortly lets take our earlier example but apply it to vectors for element wise vector multiplication you might see an open dot ∘ to represent the hadamard product 2 3\mathbf k \circ\mathbf j in other instances the author might explicitly define a different notation such as a circled dot ⊙ or a filled circle ● 3 here is how it would look in code using arrays x y to represent the 2d vectors js var s 3 var k 1 2 var j 2 3 var tmp multiply k j var result multiplyscalar tmp s 6 18 our multiply and multiplyscalar functions look like this js function multiply a b return a 0 b 0 a1 b1 function multiplyscalar a scalar return a 0 scalar a1 scalar similarly matrix multiplication typically does not use the dot · or cross symbol × matrix multiplication will be covered in a later section dot product the dot symbol · can be used to denote the dot product of two vectors sometimes this is called the scalar product since it evaluates to a scalar \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf j it is a very common feature of linear algebra and with a 3d vector it might look like this js var k 0 1 0 var j 1 0 0 var d dot k j 0 the result 0 tells us our vectors are perpendicular here is a dot function for 3 component vectors js function dot a b return a 0 b 0 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 cross product the cross symbol × can be used to denote the cross product of two vectors \mathbf k \times \mathbf j in code it would look like this js var k 0 1 0 var j 1 0 0 var result cross k j 0 0 1 here we get 0 0 1 which is perpendicular to both k and j our cross function js function cross a b var ax a 0 ay a1 az a2 bx b 0 by b1 bz b2 var rx ay bz az by var ry az bx ax bz var rz ax by ay bx return rx ry rz for other implementations of vector multiplication cross product and dot product gl vec3 gl vec2 vectors includes n dimensional sigma the big greek σ sigma is for summation in other words summing up some numbers \sum i 1 100 i here i 1 says to start at 1 and end at the number above the sigma 100 these are the lower and upper bounds respectively the i to the right of the e tells us what we are summing in code js var sum 0 for var i 1 i 100 i sum i the result of sum is 5050 tip with whole numbers this particular pattern can be optimized to the following js var n 100 upper bound var sum n n 1 2 here is another example where the i or the what to sum is different \sum i 1 100 2i 1 in code js var sum 0 for var i 1 i 100 i sum 2 i 1 the result of sum is 10200 the notation can be nested which is much like nesting a for loop you should evaluate the right most sigma first unless the author has enclosed them in parentheses to alter the order however in the following case since we are dealing with finite sums the order does not matter \sum i 1 2 \sum j 4 6 3ij in code js var sum 0 for var i 1 i 2 i for var j 4 j 6 j sum 3 i j here sum will be 135 capital pi the capital pi or big pi is very similar to sigma except we are using multiplication to find the product of a sequence of values take the following \prod i 1 6 i in code it might look like this js var value 1 for var i 1 i 6 i value i where value will evaluate to 720 pipes pipe symbols known as bars can mean different things depending on the context below are three common uses absolute value euclidean norm and determinant these three features all describe the length of an object absolute value \left x \right for a number x x means the absolute value of x in code js var x 5 var result math abs x 5 euclidean norm \left \ \mathbf v \right \ for a vector v ‖v‖ is the euclidean norm of v it is also referred to as the magnitude or length of a vector often this is represented by double bars to avoid ambiguity with the absolute value notation but sometimes you may see it with single bars \left \mathbf v \right here is an example using an array x y z to represent a 3d vector js var v 0 4 3 length v 5 the length function js function length vec var x vec 0 var y vec 1 var z vec 2 return math sqrt x x y y z z other implementations magnitude n dimensional gl vec2 length 2d vector gl vec3 length 3d vector determinant \left \mathbf a \right for a matrix a a means the determinant of matrix a here is an example computing the determinant of a 2x2 matrix represented by a flat array in column major format js var determinant require gl mat2 determinant var matrix 1 0 0 1 var det determinant matrix 1 implementations gl mat4 determinant also see gl mat3 and gl mat2 ndarray determinant glsl determinant robust determinant robust determinant 2 and robust determinant 3 specifically for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices respectively hat in geometry the hat symbol above a character is used to represent a unit vector for example here is the unit vector of a \hat \mathbf a in cartesian space a unit vector is typically length 1 that means each part of the vector will be in the range of 1 0 to 1 0 here we normalize a 3d vector into a unit vector js var a 0 4 3 normalize a 0 0 8 0 6 here is the normalize function operating on 3d vectors js function normalize vec var x vec 0 var y vec1 var z vec2 var squaredlength x x y y z z if squaredlength 0 var length math sqrt squaredlength vec 0 vec 0 length vec1 vec1 length vec2 vec2 length return vec other implementations gl vec3 normalize and gl vec2 normalize vectors normalize nd n dimensional element in set theory the element of symbol ∈ and ∋ can be used to describe whether something is an element of a set for example a \left \ 3 9 14 \right \ 3 \in a here we have a set of numbers a 3 9 14 and we are saying 3 is an element of that set a simple implementation in es5 might look like this js var a 3 9 14 a indexof 3 0 true however it would be more accurate to use a set which only holds unique values this is a feature of es6 js var a new set 3 9 14 a has 3 true the backwards ∋ is the same but the order changes a \left \ 3 9 14 \right \ a \ni 3 you can also use the not an element of symbols ∉ and ∌ like so a \left \ 3 9 14 \right \ 6 \notin a common number sets you may see some some large blackboard letters among equations often these are used to describe sets for example we might describe k to be an element of the set ℝ k \in \mathbb r listed below are a few common sets and their symbols ℝ real numbers the large ℝ describes the set of real numbers these include integers as well as rational and irrational numbers javascript treats floats and integers as the same type so the following would be a simple test of our k ∈ ℝ example js function isreal k return typeof k number isfinite k note real numbers are also finite as in not infinite ℚ rational numbers rational numbers are real numbers that can be expressed as a fraction or ratio like ⅗ rational numbers cannot have zero as a denominator this also means that all integers are rational numbers since the denominator can be expressed as 1 an irrational number on the other hand is one that cannot be expressed as a ratio like π pi ℤ integers an integer i e a real number that has no fractional part these can be positive or negative a simple test in javascript might look like this js function isinteger n return typeof n number n 1 0 ℕ natural numbers a natural number a positive and non negative integer depending on the context and field of study the set may or may not include zero so it could look like either of these js 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 the former is more common in computer science for example js function isnaturalnumber n return isinteger n n 0 ℂ complex numbers a complex number is a combination of a real and imaginary number viewed as a co ordinate in the 2d plane for more info see a visual intuitive guide to imaginary numbers function functions are fundamental features of mathematics and the concept is fairly easy to translate into code a function relates an input to an output value for example the following is a function x 2 we can give this function a name commonly we use ƒ to describe a function but it could be named a x or anything else f\left x \right x 2 in code we might name it square and write it like this js function square x return math pow x 2 sometimes a function is not named and instead the output is written y x 2 in the above example x is the input the relationship is squaring and y is the output functions can also have multiple parameters like in a programming language these are known as arguments in mathematics and the number of arguments a function takes is known as the arity of the function f x y \sqrt x 2 y 2 in code js function length x y return math sqrt x x y y piecewise function some functions will use different relationships depending on the input value x the following function ƒ chooses between two sub functions depending on the input value f x \begin cases \frac x 2 x x \text if x\geq 1\\ 0 \text otherwise \end cases this is very similar to if else in code the right side conditions are often written as for x 0 or if x 0 if the condition is true the function to the left is used in piecewise functions otherwise and elsewhere are analogous to the else statement in code js function f x if x 1 return math pow x 2 x x else return 0 common functions there are some function names that are ubiquitous in mathematics for a programmer these might be analogous to functions built in to the language like parseint in javascript one such example is the sgn function this is the signum or sign function lets use piecewise function notation to describe it sgn x \begin cases 1 \text if x 0\\ 0 \text if x 0 \\ 1 \text if x 0\\ \end cases in code it might look like this js function sgn x if x 0 return 1 if x 0 return 1 return 0 see signum for this function as a module other examples of such functions sin cos tan function notation in some literature functions may be defined with more explicit notation for example lets go back to the square function we mentioned earlier f\left x \right x 2 it might also be written in the following form f x \mapsto x 2 the arrow here with a tail typically means maps to as in x maps to x2 sometimes when it isnt obvious the notation will also describe the domain and codomain of the function a more formal definition of ƒ might be written as \begin align f \mathbb r \rightarrow \mathbb r \\ x \mapsto x 2 \end align a functions domain and codomain is a bit like its input and output types respectively heres another example using our earlier sgn function which outputs an integer sgn \mathbb r \rightarrow \mathbb z the arrow here without a tail is used to map one set to another in javascript and other dynamically typed languages you might use documentation and or runtime checks to explain and validate a functions input output example js squares a number param number a real number return number a real number function square a if typeof a number throw new typeerror expected a number return math pow a 2 some tools like flowtype attempt to bring static typing into javascript other languages like java allow for true method overloading based on the static types of a functions input output this is closer to mathematics two functions are not the same if they use a different domain prime the prime symbol ′ is often used in variable names to describe things which are similar without giving it a different name altogether it can describe the next value after some transformation for example if we take a 2d point x y and rotate it you might name the result x′ y′ or the transpose of matrix m might be named m′ in code we typically just assign the variable a more descriptive name like transformedposition for a mathematical function the prime symbol often describes the derivative of that function derivatives will be explained in a future section lets take our earlier function f\left x \right x 2 its derivative could be written with a prime ′ symbol f x 2x in code js function f x return math pow x 2 function fprime x return 2 x multiple prime symbols can be used to describe the second derivative ƒ′′ and third derivative ƒ′′′ after this authors typically express higher orders with roman numerals ƒiv or superscript numbers ƒ n floor ceiling the special brackets ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ represent the floor and ceil functions respectively floor x \lfloor x \rfloor ceil x \lceil x \rceil in code js math floor x math ceil x when the two symbols are mixed ⌊x⌉ it typically represents a function that rounds to the nearest integer round x \lfloor x \rceil in code js math round x arrows arrows are often used in function notation here are a few other areas you might see them material implication arrows like ⇒ and → are sometimes used in logic for material implication that is if a is true then b is also true a \rightarrow b interpreting this as code might look like this js if a true console assert b true the arrows can go in either direction ⇐ ⇒ or both ⇔ when a ⇒ b and b ⇒ a they are said to be equivalent a \leftrightarrow b equality in math the ≤ and ≥ are typically used in the same way we use them in code less than greater than less than or equal to and greater than or equal to respectively js 50 2 true 2 10 true 3 4 true 4 4 true on rare occasions you might see a slash through these symbols to describe not as in k is not greater than j k \ngtr j the ≪ and ≫ are sometimes used to represent significant inequality that is k is an order of magnitude larger than j k \gg j in mathematics order of magnitude is rather specific it is not just a really big difference a simple example of the above js orderofmagnitude k orderofmagnitude j and below is our orderofmagnitude function using math trunc es6 js function log10 n logarithm in base 10 return math log n math ln10 function orderofmagnitude n return math trunc log10 n note this is not numerically robust see math trunc for a ponyfill in es5 conjunction disjunction another use of arrows in logic is conjunction ∧ and disjunction ∨ they are analogous to a programmers and and or operators respectively the following shows conjunction ∧ the logical and k 2 \land k 4 \leftrightarrow k 3 in javascript we use assuming k is a natural number the logic implies that k is 3 js if k 2 k 4 console assert k 3 since both sides are equivalent ⇔ it also implies the following js if k 3 console assert k 2 k 4 the down arrow ∨ is logical disjunction like the or operator a \lor b in code js a b logical negation occasionally the ¬ and symbols are used to represent logical not for example ¬a is only true if a is false here is a simple example using the not symbol x \neq y \leftrightarrow \lnot x y an example of how we might interpret this in code js if x y console assert x y note the tilde has many different meanings depending on context for example row equivalence matrix theory or same order of magnitude discussed in equality intervals sometimes a function deals with real numbers restricted to some range of values such a constraint can be represented using an interval for example we can represent the numbers between zero and one including not including zero and or one as not including zero or one 0 1 including zero or but not one 0 1 not including zero but including one 0 1 including zero and one 0 1 for example we to indicate that a point x is in the unit cube in 3d we say x \in 0 1 3 in code we can represent an interval using a two element 1d array js var
