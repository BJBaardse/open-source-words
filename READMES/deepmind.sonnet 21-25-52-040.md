sonnet is a library built on top of tensorflow for building complex neural networks installation sonnet can be installed from pip with or without gpu support this installation is compatible with linux mac os x and python 2 7 and 3 4 5 6 the version of tensorflow installed must be 1 5 installing sonnet supports the virtualenv installation mode of tensorflow as well as the native pip install to install sonnet run shell pip install dm sonnet sonnet will work with both the cpu and gpu version of tensorflow but to allow for that it does not list tensorflow as a requirement so you need to install tensorflow separately if you havent already done so usage example the following code constructs a linear module and connects it to multiple inputs the variables i e the weights and biases of the linear transformation are automatically shared python import sonnet as snt provide your own functions to generate data tensors train data get training data test data get test data construct the module providing any configuration necessary linear regression module snt linear output size flags output size connect the module to some inputs any number of times train predictions linear regression module train data test predictions linear regression module test data documentation check out the full documentation page here
