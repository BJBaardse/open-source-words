description howler js is an audio library for the modern web it defaults to web audio api and falls back to html5 audio this makes working with audio in javascript easy and reliable across all platforms additional information live demos and a user showcase are available at howlerjs com features single api for all audio needs defaults to web audio api and falls back to html5 audio handles edge cases and bugs across environments supports all codecs for full cross browser support automatic caching for improved performance control sounds individually in groups or globally playback of multiple sounds at once easy sound sprite definition and playback full control for fading rate seek volume etc easily add 3d spatial sound or stereo panning modular use what you want and easy to extend no outside dependencies just pure javascript as light as 7kb gzipped browser compatibility tested in the following browsers versions google chrome 7 0 internet explorer 9 0 firefox 4 0 safari 5

the sources to the track s to be loaded for the sound urls or base64 data uris these should be in order of preference howler js will automatically load the first one that is compatible with the current browser if your files have no extensions you will need to explicitly specify the extension using the format property volume number 1 0 the volume of the specific track from 0 0 to 1 0 html5 boolean false set to true to force html5 audio this should be used for large audio files so that you dont have to wait for the full file to be downloaded and decoded before playing loop boolean false set to true to automatically loop the sound forever preload boolean true automatically begin downloading the audio file when the howl is defined autoplay boolean false set to true to automatically start playback when sound is loaded mute boolean false set to true to load the audio muted sprite object define a sound sprite for the sound the offset and duration are defined in milliseconds a third optional parameter is available to set a sprite as looping an easy way to generate compatible sound sprites is with audiosprite javascript key offset duration loop rate number 1 0 the rate of playback 0 5 to 4 0 with 1 0 being normal speed pool number 5 the size of the inactive sounds pool once sounds are stopped or finish playing they are marked as ended and ready for cleanup we keep a pool of these to recycle for improved performance generally this doesnt need to be changed it is important to keep in mind that when a sound is paused it wont be removed from the pool and will still be considered active so that it can be resumed later format array howler js automatically detects your file format from the extension but you may also specify a format in situations where extraction wont work such as with a soundcloud stream xhrwithcredentials boolean false whether or not to enable the withcredentials flag on xhr requests used to fetch audio files when using web audio api see

with other methods only method that cant be chained sprite id string number optional takes one parameter that can either be a sprite or sound id if a sprite is passed a new sound will play based on the sprites definition if a sound id is passed the previously played sound will be played for example after pausing it however if an id of a sound that has been drained from the pool is passed nothing will play pause id pauses playback of sound or group saving the seek of playback id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group are paused stop id stops playback of sound resetting seek to 0 id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group are stopped mute muted id mutes the sound but doesnt pause the playback muted boolean optional true to mute and false to unmute id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group are stopped volume volume id get set volume of this sound or the group this method optionally takes 0 1 or 2 arguments volume number optional volume from 0 0 to 1 0 id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group have volume altered relative to their own volume fade from to duration id fade a currently playing sound between two volumes fires the fade event when complete from number volume to fade from 0 0 to 1 0 to number volume to fade to 0 0 to 1 0 duration number time in milliseconds to fade id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group will fade rate rate id get set the rate of playback for a sound this method optionally takes 0 1 or 2 arguments rate number optional the rate of playback 0 5 to 4 0 with 1 0 being normal speed id number optional the sound id if none is passed playback rate of all sounds in group will change seek seek id get set the position of playback for a sound this method optionally takes 0 1 or 2 arguments seek number optional the position to move current playback to in seconds id number optional the sound id if none is passed the first sound will seek loop loop id get set whether to loop the sound or group this method can optionally take 0 1 or 2 arguments loop boolean optional to loop or not to loop that is the question id number optional the sound id if none is passed all sounds in group will have their loop property updated state check the load status of the howl returns a unloaded loading or loaded playing id check if a sound is currently playing or not returns a boolean if no sound id is passed check if any sound in the howl group is playing id number the sound id to check duration id get the duration of the audio source will return 0 until after the load event fires id number optional the sound id to check passing an id will return the duration of the sprite being played on this instance otherwise the full source duration is returned on event function id listen for events multiple events can be added by calling this multiple times event string name of event to fire set load loaderror

events for this sound id load this is called by default but if you set preload to false you must call load before you can play any sounds unload unload and destroy a howl object this will immediately stop all sounds attached to this sound and remove it from the cache global options usingwebaudio boolean true if the web audio api is available noaudio boolean true if no audio is available mobileautoenable boolean true automatically attempts to enable audio on mobile ios android etc devices autosuspend boolean true automatically suspends the web audio audiocontext after 30 seconds of inactivity to decrease processing and energy usage automatically resumes upon new playback set this property to false to disable this behavior ctx boolean web audio only exposes the audiocontext with web audio api mastergain boolean web audio only exposes the master gainnode with web audio api this can be useful for writing plugins or advanced usage global methods the following methods are used to modify all sounds globally and are called from the howler object mute muted mute or unmute all sounds muted boolean true to mute and false to unmute volume volume get set the global volume for all sounds relative to their own volume volume number optional volume from 0 0 to 1 0 codecs ext check supported audio codecs returns true if the codec is supported in the current browser ext string file extension one of mp3 mpeg opus ogg oga wav aac caf m4a mp4 weba webm dolby flac unload unload and destroy all currently loaded howl objects this will immediately stop all sounds and remove them from cache plugin spatial options orientation array 1 0 0 sets the direction the audio source is pointing in the 3d cartesian coordinate space depending on how directional the sound is based on the cone attributes a sound pointing away from the listener can be quiet or silent stereo number null sets the stereo panning value of the audio source for this sound or group this makes it easy to setup left right panning with a value of 1 0 being far left and a value of 1 0 being far right pos array null sets the 3d spatial position of the audio source for this sound or group relative to the global listener pannerattr object sets the panner nodes attributes for a sound or group of sounds see the pannerattr method for all available options onstereo function fires when the current sound has the stereo panning changed the first parameter is the id of the sound onpos function fires when the current sound has the listener position changed the first parameter is the id of the sound onorientation

a sound is played within a user interaction and then it plays normally the rest of the page session apple documentation the default behavior of howler js is to attempt to silently unlock audio playback by playing an empty buffer on the first touchend event this behavior can be disabled by calling javascript howler mobileautoenable false dolby audio playback full support for playback of the dolby audio format currently support in edge and safari is included however you must specify that the file you are loading is dolby since it is in a mp4 container javascript var dolbysound new howl src sound mp4 sound webm sound mp3 format dolby webm mp3 facebook instant games howler js provides audio support for the new facebook instant games platform if you encounter any issues while developing for instant games open an issue with the tag ig format recommendations howler js supports a wide array of audio codecs that have varying browser support mp3 opus ogg wav aac m4a mp4 webm but if you want full browser coverage you still need to use at least two of them if your goal is to have the best balance of small filesize and high quality based on extensive production testing your best bet is to default to webm and fallback to mp3 webm has nearly full browser coverage with a great combination of compression and quality youll need the mp3 fallback for internet explorer it is important to remember that howler js selects the first compatible sound from your array of sources so if you want webm to be used before mp3 you need to put the sources in that order if you want your webm files to be seekable in firefox be sure to encode them with the cues element one way to do this is by using the dash flag in ffmpeg ffmpeg i sound1 wav dash 1 sound1 webm license copyright c 2013
