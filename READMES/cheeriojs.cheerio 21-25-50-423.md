cheerio fast flexible lean implementation of core jquery designed specifically for the server js const cheerio require cheerio const cheerio load hello world h2 title text hello there h2 addclass welcome html hello there installation npm install cheerio features ❤ familiar syntax cheerio implements a subset of core jquery cheerio removes all the dom inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jquery library revealing its truly gorgeous api ϟ blazingly fast cheerio works with a very simple consistent dom model as a result parsing manipulating and rendering are incredibly efficient preliminary end to end benchmarks suggest that cheerio is about 8x faster than jsdom ❁ incredibly flexible cheerio wraps around fb55s forgiving htmlparser2 cheerio can parse nearly any html or xml document cheerio is not a web browser cheerio parses markup and provides an api for traversing manipulating the resulting data structure it does not interpret the result as a web browser does specifically it does not produce a visual rendering apply css load external resources or execute javascript if your use case requires any of this functionality you should consider projects like phantomjs or jsdom sponsors does your company use cheerio in production please consider sponsoring this project your help will allow maintainers to dedicate more time and resources to its development and support backers become a backer to show your support for cheerio and help us maintain and improve this open source project api table of contents selectors selector context root selector context

this is the html markup we will be using in all of the api examples loading first you need to load in the html this step in jquery is implicit since jquery operates on the one baked in dom with cheerio we need to pass in the html document this is the preferred method js const cheerio require cheerio const cheerio load ul id fruits ul optionally you can also load in the html by passing the string as the context js const require cheerio ul ul id fruits ul or as the root js const require cheerio li ul ul id fruits ul you can also pass an extra object to load if you need to modify any of the default parsing options js const cheerio load ul id fruits ul normalizewhitespace true xmlmode true these parsing options are taken directly from htmlparser2 therefore any options that can be used in htmlparser2 are valid in cheerio as well the default options are js withdomlvl1 true normalizewhitespace false xmlmode false decodeentities true for a full list of options and their effects see this and htmlparser2s options selectors cheerios selector implementation is nearly identical to jquerys so the api is very similar selector context root selector searches within the context scope which searches within the root scope selector and context can be a string expression dom element array of dom elements or cheerio object root is typically the html document string this selector method is the starting point for traversing and manipulating the document like jquery its the primary method for selecting elements in the document but unlike jquery its built on top of the cssselect library which implements most of the sizzle selectors js apple fruits text apple ul pear attr class pear li class orange html orange xml namespaces you can select with xml namespaces but due to the css specification the colon needs to be escaped for the selector to be valid js xml\\ id main attributes methods for getting and modifying attributes attr name value method for getting and setting attributes gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set if you set an attributes value to null you remove that attribute you may also pass a map and function like jquery js ul attr id fruits apple attr id favorite html apple see http api jquery com attr for more information prop name value method for getting and setting properties gets the property value for only the first element in the matched set js input type checkbox prop checked false input type checkbox prop checked true val ok see http api jquery com prop for more information data name value method for getting and setting data attributes gets or sets the data attribute value for only the first element in the matched set js data applecolor red data apple color red const apple apple data kind mac apple data kind mac see http api jquery com data for more information val value method for getting and setting the value of input select and textarea note support for map and function has not been added yet js input type text val input text input type text val test html removeattr name method for removing attributes by name js pear removeattr class html li pear li hasclass classname check to see if any of the matched elements have the given classname js pear hasclass pear true apple hasclass fruit false li hasclass pear true addclass classname adds class es to all of the matched elements also accepts a function like jquery js pear addclass fruit html pear apple addclass fruit red html apple see http api jquery com addclass for more information removeclass classname removes one or more space separated classes from the selected elements if no classname is defined all classes will be removed also accepts a function like jquery js pear removeclass pear html pear apple addclass red removeclass html apple see http api jquery com removeclass for more information toggleclass classname switch add or remove class es from the matched elements depending on either the classs presence or the value of the switch argument also accepts a function like jquery js apple green toggleclass fruit green red html apple apple green toggleclass fruit green red true html apple see http api jquery com toggleclass for more information is selector is element is selection is function index checks the current list of elements and returns true if any of the elements match the selector if using an element or cheerio selection returns true if any of the elements match if using a predicate function the function is executed in the context of the selected element so this refers to the current element forms serialize encodes a set of form elements as a url query string js form input name foo value bar checked input name foo value qux checked form serialize foo bar foo qux serializearray encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values js form input name foo value bar form serializearray name foo value bar traversing find selector find selection find node get the

set of matched elements including text and comment nodes js fruits contents length 3 each function index element iterates over a cheerio object executing a function for each matched element when the callback is fired the function is fired in the context of the dom element so this refers to the current element which is equivalent to the function parameter element to break out of the each loop early return with false js const fruits li each function i elem fruits i this text fruits join apple orange pear map function index element pass each element in the current matched set through a function producing a new cheerio object containing the return values the function can return an individual data item or an array of data items to be inserted into the resulting set if an array is returned the elements inside the array are inserted into the set if the function returns null or undefined no element will be inserted js li map function i el this el return this text get join apple orange pear filter selector filter selection filter element filter function index element iterates over a cheerio object reducing the set of selector elements to those that match the selector or pass the functions test when a cheerio selection is specified return only the elements contained in that selection when an element is specified return only that element if it is contained in the original selection if using the function method the function is executed in the context of the selected element so this refers to the current element selector js li filter orange attr class orange function js li filter function i el this el return this attr class orange attr class orange not selector not selection not element not function index elem remove elements from the set of matched elements given a jquery object that represents a set of dom elements the not method constructs a new jquery object from a subset of the matching elements the supplied selector is tested against each element the elements that dont match the selector will be included in the result the not method can take a function as its argument in the same way that filter does elements for which the function returns true are excluded from the filtered set all other elements are included selector js li not apple length 2 function js li not function i el this el return this attr class orange length 2 has selector has

can take any string or object that could be passed to the factory function to specify a dom structure this structure may be nested several levels deep but should contain only one inmost element a copy of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements this method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes js const redfruit apple wrap redfruit apple orange plum const healthy li wrap healthy apple orange plum css propertyname css propertynames css propertyname value css propertyname function css properties get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more css properties for every matched element rendering when youre ready to render the document you can use the html utility function js html ul id fruits li class apple apple li li class orange orange li li class pear pear li ul if you want to return the outerhtml you can use html selector js html pear li class pear pear li by default html will leave some tags open sometimes you may instead want to render a valid xml document for example you might parse the following xml snippet xml const cheerio load media thumbnail url http www foo com keyframe jpg width 75 height 50 time 12 05 01 123 and later want to render to xml to do this you can use the xml utility function js xml media thumbnail url http www foo com keyframe jpg width 75 height 50 time 12 05 01 123 you may also render the text content of a cheerio object using the text static method js const cheerio load this is em content em text this is content the method may be called on the cheerio module itself be sure to pass a collection of nodes js const cheerio load div this is em content em div cheerio text div this is content miscellaneous dom element methods that dont fit anywhere else toarray retrieve all the dom elements contained in the jquery set as an array js li toarray clone clone the cheerio object js const morefruit fruits clone utilities root sometimes you need to work with the top level root element to query it you can use root js root append ul id vegetables ul html ul id fruits ul ul id vegetables ul contains container contained checks to see if the contained dom element is a descendant of the container dom element parsehtml data context keepscripts parses a string into an array of dom nodes the context argument has no meaning for cheerio but it is maintained for api compatability load html options load in the html see the previous section titled loading for more information plugins once you have loaded a document you may extend the prototype or the equivalent fn property with custom plugin methods js const cheerio load hello world prototype loghtml function console log this html body loghtml logs hello world to the console the dom node object cheerio collections are made up of objects that bear some resemblence to browser based dom nodes you can expect them to define the following properties

wiki testing to run the test suite download the repository then within the cheerio directory run shell make setup make test this will download the development packages and run the test suite special thanks this library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers a special thanks to • fb55 for node htmlparser2 cssselect felix has a knack for writing speedy parsing engines he completely re wrote both tautologistics node htmlparser and harrys node soupselect from the ground up making both of them much faster and more flexible cheerio would not be possible without his foundational work • jquery team for jquery the core api is the best of its class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow much of cheerios implementation and documentation is from jquery thanks guys • visionmedia the style the structure the open source ness of this library comes from studying tjs style and using many of his libraries this dude consistently pumps out high quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions you rock tj license mit
