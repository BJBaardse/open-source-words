exoplayer exoplayer is an application level media player for android it provides an alternative to androids mediaplayer api for playing audio and video both locally and over the internet exoplayer supports features not currently supported by androids mediaplayer api including dash and smoothstreaming adaptive playbacks unlike the mediaplayer api exoplayer is easy to customize and extend and can be updated through play store application updates documentation the developer guide provides a wealth of information the class reference documents exoplayer classes the release notes document the major changes in each release follow our developer blog to keep up to date with the latest exoplayer developments using exoplayer exoplayer modules can be obtained from jcenter its also possible to clone the repository and depend on the modules locally from jcenter the easiest way to get started using exoplayer is to add it as a gradle dependency you need to make sure you have the jcenter and google repositories included in the build gradle file in the root of your project gradle repositories jcenter google next add a dependency in the build gradle file of your app module the following will add a dependency to the full library gradle implementation com google android exoplayer exoplayer 2 x x where 2 x x is your preferred version alternatively you can depend on only the library modules that you actually need for example the following will add dependencies on the core dash and ui library modules as might be required for an app that plays dash content gradle implementation com google android exoplayer exoplayer core 2 x x implementation com google android exoplayer exoplayer dash 2 x x implementation com google android exoplayer exoplayer ui 2 x x the available library modules are listed below adding a dependency to the full library is equivalent to adding dependencies on all of the library modules individually exoplayer core core functionality required exoplayer dash support for dash content exoplayer hls support for hls content exoplayer smoothstreaming support for smoothstreaming content exoplayer ui ui components and resources for use with exoplayer in addition to library modules exoplayer has multiple extension modules that depend on external libraries to provide additional functionality some extensions are available from jcenter whereas others must be built manually browse the extensions directory and their individual readmes for details more information on the library and extension modules that are available from jcenter can be found on bintray locally cloning the repository and depending on the modules locally is required when using some exoplayer extension modules its also a suitable approach if you want to make local changes to exoplayer or if you want to use a development branch first clone the repository into a local directory and checkout the desired branch sh git clone https github com google exoplayer git git checkout release v2 next add the following to your projects settings gradle file replacing path to exoplayer with the path to your local copy gradle gradle ext exoplayerroot path to exoplayer gradle ext exoplayermoduleprefix exoplayer apply from new file gradle ext exoplayerroot core settings gradle you should now see the exoplayer modules appear as part of your project you can depend on them as you would on any other local module for example gradle implementation project exoplayer library core implementation project exoplayer library dash implementation project exoplayer library ui developing exoplayer project branches development work happens on the dev v2 branch pull requests should normally be made to this branch the release v2 branch holds the most recent release using android studio to develop exoplayer using android studio simply open the exoplayer project in the root directory of the repository
