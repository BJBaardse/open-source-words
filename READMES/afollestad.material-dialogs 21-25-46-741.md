sample apk its also on google play having the sample project installed is a good way to be notified of new releases although watching this repository will allow github to email you whenever i publish a release gradle dependency repository the gradle dependency is available via jcenter jcenter is the default maven repository used by android studio the minimum api level supported by this library is api 14 core the core module contains all the major classes of this library including materialdialog you can create basic list single multi choice progress input etc dialogs with core gradle dependencies other dependencies here implementation com afollestad material dialogs core 0 9 6 0 commons the commons module contains extensions to the library that not everyone may need this includes the colorchooserdialog folderchooserdialog the material preference classes and materialsimplelistadapter materialsimplelistitem gradle dependencies other dependencies here implementation com

releases if you watch this repository github will send you an email every time i publish an update basic dialog first of all note that materialdialog extends dialogbase which extends android app dialog heres a basic example that mimics the dialog you see on googles material design guidelines here http www google com design spec components dialogs html dialogs usage note that you can always substitute literal strings and string resources for methods that take strings the same goes for color resources e g titlecolor and titlecolorres java new materialdialog builder this title r string title content r string content positivetext r string agree negativetext r string disagree show your activities need to inherit the appcompat themes in order to work correctly with this library the material dialog will automatically match the positivecolor which is used on the positive action button to the coloraccent attribute of your styles xml theme if the content is long enough it will become scrollable and a divider will be displayed above the action buttons dismissing dialogs ive had lots of issues asking how you dismiss a dialog it works the same way that alertdialog does as both alertdialog and materialdialog are an instance of android app dialog which is where dismiss and show come from you cannot dismiss a dialog using its builder you can only dismiss a dialog using the dialog itself theres many ways you can get an instance of materialdialog the two major ways are through the show and build methods of materialdialog builder through show which immediately shows the dialog and returns the visible dialog java materialdialog dialog new materialdialog builder this title r string title content r string content positivetext r string agree show through build which only builds the dialog but doesnt show it until you say so java materialdialog builder builder new materialdialog builder this title r string title content r string content positivetext r string agree materialdialog dialog builder build dialog show once the dialog is shown you can dismiss it java dialog dismiss there are other various places where the materialdialog instance is given such as in some callbacks that are discussed in future sections below displaying an icon materialdialog supports the display of an icon just like the stock alertdialog it will go to the left of the title java new materialdialog builder this title r string title content r string content positivetext r string agree icon r drawable icon show you can limit the maximum size of the icon using the limiticontodefaultsize maxiconsize int size or maxiconsizeres int sizeres builder methods stacked action buttons if you have multiple action buttons that together are too wide to fit on one line the dialog will stack the buttons to be vertically oriented java new materialdialog builder this title r string title content r string content positivetext r string longer positive negativetext r string

checkbox prompts allow you to display a ui similar to what android uses to ask for a permission on api 23 note you can use checkbox prompts with list dialogs and input dialogs too java new

youre not using a custom adapter if you do not set a positive action button using positivetext the dialog will automatically call the single choice callback when user presses the positive action

choicewidgetcolor is specific to single and multiple choice dialogs it only affects radio buttons and checkboxes you provide a colorstatelist rather than a single color which is used to generate a

theres also a global theming attribute as shown in the global theming section of this readme md widget color assigning ids to list item views if you need to keep track of list items by id rather than

exactly how you want your list to work java new materialdialog builder this title r string socialnetworks second parameter is an optional layout manager must be a linearlayoutmanager or gridlayoutmanager adapter new buttonitemadapter this r array socialnetworks null show note that with newer releases material dialogs no longer supports listview and listadapter its about time that everyone uses recyclerview your custom adapters will have to handle item click events on their own this librarys classes and sample project have some good examples of how that is done correctly if you need access to the recyclerview you can use the materialdialog instance java materialdialog dialog new materialdialog builder this build recyclerview list dialog getrecyclerview do something with it dialog show note that you dont need to be using a custom adapter in order to access the recyclerview its there for single multi choice dialogs regular list dialogs etc custom views custom views are very easy to implement java boolean wrapinscrollview true new materialdialog builder this title r string title customview r layout custom view wrapinscrollview positivetext r string positive show if wrapinscrollview is true then the library will place your custom view inside of a scrollview for you this allows users to scroll your custom view if necessary small screens long content etc however there are cases when you dont want that behavior this mostly consists of cases when youd have a scrollview in your custom layout including listviews recyclerviews webviews gridviews etc the sample project contains examples of using both true and false for this parameter your custom view will automatically have padding put around it when wrapinscrollview is true otherwise youre responsible for using padding values that look good with your content later access if you need to access a view in the custom view after the dialog is built you can use getcustomview of materialdialog this is especially useful if you pass a layout resource to the builder the dialog will handle the view inflation for you java materialdialog dialog initialization via the builder view view dialog getcustomview typefaces if you want to use custom fonts you can make a call to typeface string string when using the builder this will pull fonts from files in your projects assets fonts folder for example if you had roboto ttf and roboto light ttf in src main assets fonts you would call typeface roboto ttf roboto light ttf this method will also handle recycling typefaces via the typefacehelper which you can use in your own project to avoid duplicate allocations the raw typeface typeface typeface variation will not recycle typefaces every call will allocate the typeface again theres a global theming attribute available to automatically apply fonts to every material dialog in your app also getting and setting action buttons if you want to get a reference to one of the dialog action buttons after the dialog is built and shown e g to enable or disable buttons java materialdialog dialog initialization via the builder view negative dialog getactionbutton dialogaction negative view neutral dialog getactionbutton dialogaction neutral view positive dialog getactionbutton dialogaction positive if you want to update the title of a dialog action button you can pass a string resource id in place of the literal string too java materialdialog dialog initialization via the builder dialog setactionbutton dialogaction negative new title theming before lollipop theming alertdialogs was basically impossible without using reflection and custom drawables since kitkat android became more color neutral but alertdialogs continued to use holo blue for the title and title divider lollipop has improved even more with no colors in the dialog by default other than the action buttons this library makes theming even easier basics by default material dialogs will apply a light theme or dark theme based on the android textcolorprimary attribute retrieved from the context creating the dialog if the color is light e g more white it will guess the activity is using a dark theme and it will use the dialogs dark theme vice versa for the light theme you can manually set the theme used from the builder theme method java new materialdialog builder this content hi theme theme dark show or you can use the global theming attribute which is discussed in the section below global theming avoids having to constantly call theme setters for every dialog you show colors pretty much every aspect of a dialog created with this library can be colored java new materialdialog builder this titlecolorres r color material red 500 contentcolor color white notice no res postfix for literal color

material red 500 show the names are self explanatory for the most part the widgetcolor method discussed in a few other sections of this tutorial applies to progress bars check boxes and radio buttons also note that each of these methods have 3 variations for setting a color directly using color resources and using color attributes selectors selectors are drawables that change state when pressed or focused java new materialdialog builder this btnselector r drawable custom btn selector btnselector r drawable custom btn selector primary dialogaction positive btnselectorstacked r drawable custom btn selector stacked listselector r drawable custom list and stackedbtn selector show the first btnselector line sets a selector drawable used for all action buttons the second btnselector line overwrites the drawable used only for the positive button this results in the positive button having a different selector than the neutral and negative buttons btnselectorstacked sets a selector drawable used when the buttons become stacked either because theres not enough room to fit them all on one line or because you used forcestacked true on the builder listselector is used for list items when you are not using a custom adapter note an important note related to using custom action button selectors make sure your selector drawable references inset drawables like the default ones do this is important for correct action button padding gravity its probably unlikely youd want to change gravity of elements in a dialog but its possible java new materialdialog builder this titlegravity

edittext based on whether you think the input is acceptable input dialogs is to call alwayscallinputcallback from the builder so that the callback is invoked every time the user changes their input

progress bars if you use appcompat to theme your app or the material theme on lollipop proguard normally objectanimator in the context its used in this library for custom progress drawables would need special proguard rules so that certain elements arent removed when your app is built in release mode luckily aar packages are allowed to specify proguard rules that get included in apps that depend on
