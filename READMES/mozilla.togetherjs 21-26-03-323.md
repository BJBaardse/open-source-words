togetherjs surprisingly easy collaboration what is togetherjs togetherjs is a service for your website that makes it surprisingly easy to collaborate in real time using togetherjs two people can interact on the same page seeing each others cursors edits and browsing a site together the togetherjs service is included by the web site owner and a web site can customize and configure aspects of togetherjss behavior on the site for more information and to see togetherjs in action visit togetherjs com if you want to integrate togetherjs onto your site see the wiki and specifically getting started contributing the remainder of this document is about contributing to togetherjs but reports fixes features etc look back at those other links if you are looking for something else bug reports please submit bug reports as github issues dont worry about labels or milestones if you use the in app feedback to give us a bug report thats fine too roadmap plans to see what were planning or at least considering to do with togetherjs look at see our bug tracker setting up a development environment togetherjs has two main pieces the server which echos messages back and forth between users the server doesnt do much you may gaze upon its incredibly boring history the client in togetherjs which does all the real work there is a togetherjs hub server deployed at https hub togetherjs com and theres little need for other server deployments if you want to try togetherjs out we recommend you use our hub server note if you include togetherjs on an https site you must use an https hub server the files need to be lightly built we use less for styles and a couple files are generated to develop you need to build the library using grunt to build a copy of the library check out togetherjs sh git clone git github com mozilla togetherjs git cd togetherjs then install npm and run sh npm install npm install g grunt cli this will install a bunch of stuff most of which is only used for development the only server dependency is websocket node and if you use our hub then you dont need to worry about the server by default everything is installed locally i e in node modules this works just fine but it is useful to install the grunt command line program globally which npm install g grunt cli does now you can build togetherjs like sh grunt build buildsite no hardlink this will create a copy of the entire togetherjs com site in build youll need to setup a local web server of your own pointed to the build directory to start a server on port 8080 run sh node devserver js if you want to develop with togetherjs you probably want the files built continually to do this use sh grunt devwatch this will rebuild when changes are detected note that grunt is configured to create hard links instead of copying so that most changes you make to files in togetherjs dont need to be rebuilt to show up in build togetherjs no hardlink turns this behavior off you may wish to create a static copy of the togetherjs client to distribute and use on your website to do this run sh grunt build base url https myapp com no hardlink dest static myapp then static myapp togetherjs js and static myapp togetherjs min js will be in place and the rest of the code will be under static myapp togetherjs you would deploy these on your server running a local server you shouldnt need to run your own version of the hub server but if you happen to make changes to the server you can change the default hub url by setting the hub url environment variable when building for example hub url http localhost 8080 grunt devwatch testing tests are in togetherjs tests these are doctest js tests to actually run the tests build togetherjs serve it up and go to http localhost port togetherjs tests from there the tests are linked to from the top of the page the actual tests are js files in togetherjs tests generally test js for unit style tests and func js for functional tests the manual testing link is something that lets you simulate different conditions in togetherjs without setting up a second browser client there is unfortunately no automated runner for these tests it might be nice if karma could be setup with doctest js in general but so far that isnt done license this source code form is subject to the terms of the mozilla public license v 2 0 if a copy of the mpl was not distributed with this file you can obtain one at http mozilla org mpl 2 0
