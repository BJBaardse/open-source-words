phpmailer a full featured email creation and transfer class for php build status class features probably the worlds most popular code for sending email from php used by many open source projects wordpress drupal 1crm sugarcrm yii joomla and many more integrated smtp support send without a local mail server send emails with multiple to cc bcc and reply to addresses multipart alternative emails for mail clients that do not read html email add attachments including inline support for utf 8 content and 8bit base64 binary and quoted printable encodings smtp authentication with login plain cram md5 and xoauth2 mechanisms over ssl and smtp starttls transports validates email addresses automatically protect against header injection attacks error messages in 47 languages dkim and s mime signing support compatible with php 5 5 and later namespaced to prevent name clashes much more why you might need it many php developers utilize email in their code the only php function that supports this is the mail function however it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as html based emails and attachments formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult there are myriad overlapping rfcs requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules the vast majority of code that youll find online that uses the mail function directly is just plain wrong please dont be tempted to do it yourself if you dont use phpmailer there are many other excellent libraries that you should look at before rolling your own try swiftmailer zend mail ezcomponents etc the php mail function usually sends via a local mail server typically fronted by a sendmail binary on linux bsd and os x platforms however windows usually doesnt include a local mail server phpmailers integrated smtp implementation allows email sending on windows platforms without a local mail server license this software is distributed under the lgpl 2 1 license please read license for information on the software availability and distribution installation loading phpmailer is available on packagist using semantic versioning and installation via composer is the recommended way to install phpmailer just add this line to your composer json file json phpmailer phpmailer 6 0 or run sh composer require phpmailer phpmailer note that the vendor folder and the vendor autoload php script are generated by composer they are not part of phpmailer if you want to use the gmail xoauth2 authentication class you will also need to add a dependency on the league oauth2 client package in your composer json alternatively if youre not using composer copy the contents of the phpmailer folder into one of the include path directories specified in your php configuration and load each class file manually php php use phpmailer\phpmailer\phpmailer use phpmailer\phpmailer\exception require path to phpmailer src exception php require path to phpmailer src phpmailer php require path to phpmailer src smtp php if youre not using the smtp class explicitly youre probably not you dont need a use line for the smtp class if you dont speak git or just want a tarball click the zip button on the right of the project page in github though note that docs and examples are not included in the tarball legacy versions phpmailer 5 2 which is compatible with php 5 0 7 0 is no longer being supported for feature updates and will only be receiving security updates from now on you will find the latest version of 5 2 in the 5 2 stable branch and future versions of 5 2 will be tagged with 5 2 x version numbers so existing composer configs should remain working if youre using php 5 5 or later we recommend you make the necessary changes to switch to the 6 0 release upgrading from 5 2 the biggest changes are that source files are now in the src folder and phpmailer now declares the namespace phpmailer\phpmailer this has several important effects ‚Äì read the upgrade guide for more details minimal installation while installing the entire package manually or with composer is simple convenient and reliable you may want to include only vital files in your project at the very least you will need src phpmailer php if youre using smtp youll need src smtp php and if youre using pop before smtp youll need src pop3 php you can skip the language folder if youre not showing errors to users and can make do with english only errors if youre using xoauth2 you will need src oauth php as well as the composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with really its much easier to use composer a simple example php php import phpmailer classes into the global namespace these must be at the top of your script not inside a function use

phpmailer localization phpmailer defaults to english but in the language folder youll find numerous 48 at the time of writing translations for phpmailer error messages that you may encounter their filenames contain iso 639 1 language code for the translations for example fr for french to specify a language you need to tell phpmailer which one to use like this php to load the french version mail setlanguage fr optional path to language directory we welcome corrections and new languages if youre looking for corrections to do run the phpmailerlangtest php script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations documentation start reading at the github wiki if youre having trouble this should be the first place you look as its the most frequently updated examples of how to use phpmailer for common scenarios can be found in the examples folder if youre looking for a good starting point we recommend you start with the gmail example note that in order to reduce phpmailers deployed code footprint the examples are no longer included if you load phpmailer via composer or via githubs zip file download so youll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly complete generated api documentation is available online you can generate complete api level documentation by running phpdoc in the top level folder and documentation will appear in teh docs folder though youll need to have phpdocumentor installed you may find the unit tests a good source of how to do various operations such as encryption if the documentation doesnt cover what you need search the many questions on stack overflow and before you ask a question about smtp error could not connect to smtp host read the troubleshooting guide tests there is a phpunit test script in the test folder phpmailer uses phpunit 4 8 we would use 5 x but we need to run on php 5 5 build status if this isnt passing is there something you can do to help security please
