javascript algorithms and data structures this repository contains javascript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures each algorithm and data structure has its own separate readme with related explanations and links for further reading including ones to youtube videos read this in other languages 简体中文 繁體中文 data structures a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently more precisely a data structure is a collection of data values the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data b beginner a advanced b linked list b doubly linked list b queue b stack b hash table b heap b priority queue a trie a tree a binary search tree a avl tree a red black tree a segment tree with min max sum range queries examples a fenwick tree binary indexed tree a graph both directed and undirected a disjoint set a bloom filter algorithms an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems it is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations b beginner a advanced algorithms by topic math b bit

tower of hanoi b square matrix rotation in place algorithm b jump game backtracking dynamic programming top down bottom up and greedy examples a n queens problem a knights tour algorithms by paradigm an algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class of algorithms it is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program brute force look at all the possibilities and selects the best solution a maximum subarray a travelling salesman problem shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city greedy choose the best option at the current time without any consideration for the future b jump game a unbound knapsack problem a dijkstra algorithm finding shortest path to all graph vertices a prims algorithm finding minimum spanning tree mst for weighted undirected graph a kruskals algorithm finding minimum spanning tree mst for weighted undirected graph divide and conquer divide the problem into smaller parts and then solve those parts b binary search b tower of hanoi b pascals triangle b euclidean algorithm calculate the greatest common divisor gcd b merge sort b quicksort b tree depth first search dfs b graph depth first search dfs b jump game a permutations with and without repetitions a combinations with and without repetitions dynamic programming build up a solution using previously found sub solutions b fibonacci number b jump game a levenshtein distance minimum edit distance between two sequences a longest common subsequence lcs a longest common substring a longest increasing subsequence a shortest common supersequence a 0 1 knapsack problem a integer partition a maximum subarray a bellman ford algorithm finding shortest path to all graph vertices a regular expression matching backtracking similarly to brute force try to generate all possible solutions but each time you generate next solution you test if it satisfies all conditions and only then continue generating subsequent solutions otherwise backtrack and go on a different path of finding a solution normally the dfs traversal of state space is being used b jump game a hamiltonian cycle visit every vertex exactly once a n queens problem a knights tour a combination sum find all combinations that form specific sum branch bound remember the lowest cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking search and use the cost of the lowest cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of a least cost solution to the problem in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the lowest cost solution found so far normally bfs traversal in combination with dfs traversal of state space tree is being used how to use this repository install all dependencies npm install run eslint you may want to run it to check code quality npm run lint run all tests npm test run tests by name npm test linkedlist playground you may play with data structures and algorithms in src playground playground js file and write tests for it in src playground test playground test js then just simply run the following command to test if your playground code works as expected npm test playground useful information references ▶ data structures and algorithms on youtube big o notation order of growth of algorithms specified in big o
