eslint website configuring rules contributing reporting bugs code of conduct twitter mailing list chat room eslint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ecmascript javascript code in many ways it is similar to jslint and jshint with a few exceptions eslint uses espree for javascript parsing eslint uses an ast to evaluate patterns in code eslint is completely pluggable every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime installation and usage prerequisites node js 6 14 npm version 3 there are two ways to install eslint globally and locally local installation and usage if you want to include eslint as part of your projects build system we recommend installing it locally you can do so using npm npm install eslint save dev you should then setup a configuration file node modules bin eslint init after that you can run eslint on any file or directory like this node modules bin eslint yourfile js any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed locally to work with a locally installed eslint global installation and usage if you want to make eslint available to tools that run across all of your projects we recommend installing eslint globally you can do so using npm npm install g eslint you should then setup a configuration file eslint init after that you can run eslint on any file or directory like this eslint yourfile js any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed globally to work with a globally installed eslint note eslint init is intended for setting up and configuring eslint on a per project basis and will perform a local installation of eslint and its plugins in the directory in which it is run if you prefer using a global installation of eslint any plugins used in your configuration must also be installed globally configuration after running eslint init youll have a eslintrc file in your directory in it youll see some rules configured like this json rules semi error always quotes error double the names semi and quotes are the names of rules in eslint the first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values off or 0 turn the rule off warn or 1 turn the rule on as a warning doesnt affect exit code error or 2 turn the rule on as an error exit code will be 1 the three error levels allow you fine grained control over how eslint applies rules for more configuration options and details see the configuration docs code of conduct eslint adheres to the js foundation code of conduct filing issues before filing an issue please be sure to read the guidelines for what youre reporting bug report propose a new rule proposing a rule change request a change frequently asked questions im using jscs should i migrate to eslint maybe depending on how much you need it jscs has reached end of life but if it is working for you then there is no reason to move yet there are still a few issues pending well announce when all of the changes necessary to support jscs users in eslint are complete and will start encouraging jscs users to switch to eslint at that time if you are having issues with jscs you can try to move to eslint have a look at our migration guide does prettier replace eslint no eslint does both traditional linting looking for problematic patterns and style checking enforcement of conventions you can use eslint for everything or you can combine both using prettier to format your code and eslint to catch possible errors why cant eslint find my plugins eslint can be globally or locally installed if you install eslint globally your plugins must also be installed globally if you install eslint locally your plugins must also be installed locally if you are trying to run globally make sure your plugins are installed globally use npm ls g if you are trying to run locally make sure your plugins and eslint are both in your projects package json as devdependencies or dependencies if your project uses eslint at runtime make sure you have run npm install and all your dependencies are installed in all cases make sure your plugins peerdependencies have been installed as well you can use npm view eslint plugin myplugin peerdepencies to see what peer dependencies eslint plugin myplugin has does eslint support jsx yes eslint natively supports parsing jsx syntax this must be enabled in configuration please note that supporting jsx syntax is not the same as supporting react react applies specific semantics to jsx syntax that eslint doesnt recognize we recommend using eslint plugin react if you are using react and want react semantics what ecmascript versions does eslint support eslint has full support for ecmascript 3 5 default 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 you can set your desired ecmascript syntax and other settings like global variables or your target environments through configuration what about experimental features eslints parser only officially supports the latest final ecmascript standard we will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ecmascript syntax proposals as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental estree syntax we may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions such as jsx flow and typescript on a case by case basis in other cases including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax rather than just not crashing we recommend you use other parsers and or rule plugins if you are using babel you can use the babel eslint parser and eslint plugin babel to use any option available in babel once a language feature has been adopted into the ecmascript standard stage 4 according to the tc39 process we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature subject to our contributing guidelines until then please use the appropriate parser and plugin s for your experimental feature where to ask for help join our mailing list or chatroom releases we have scheduled releases every two weeks on friday or saturday you can follow a release issue for updates about the scheduling of any particular release semantic versioning policy eslint follows semantic versioning however due to the nature of eslint as a code quality tool its not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs to help clarify this for everyone weve defined the following semantic versioning policy for eslint patch release intended to not break your lint build a bug fix in a rule that results in eslint reporting fewer errors a bug fix to the cli or core including formatters improvements to documentation non user facing changes such as refactoring code adding deleting or modifying tests and increasing test coverage re releasing after a failed release i e publishing a release that doesnt work for anyone minor release might break your lint build a bug fix in a rule that results in eslint reporting more errors a new rule is created a new option to an existing rule that does not result in eslint reporting more errors by default an existing rule is deprecated a new cli capability is created new capabilities to the public api are added new classes new methods new arguments to existing methods etc a new formatter is created major release likely to break your lint build eslint recommended is updated a new option to an existing rule that results in eslint reporting more errors by default an existing formatter is removed part of the public api is removed or changed in an incompatible way according to our policy any minor update may report more errors than the previous release ex from a bug fix as such we recommend using the tilde in package json e g eslint 3 1 0 to guarantee the results of your builds license team these folks keep the project
