php framework interoperability group the idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together our main audience is each other but were very aware that the rest of the php community is watching if other folks want to adopt what were doing they are welcome to do so but that is not the aim proposing a standard recommendation to propose a php standard recommendation psr fork this repo create a branch checkout that branch add the psr in proposed push the branch to github and send a pull request or create a ticket to start a discussion on github or start a conversation on the mailing list github usage all discussion regarding a psr happens on the mailing list issues filed in github are rarely monitored and prs are likely to be missed unless a message is sent to the mailing list regarding them reviews of a proposed psr should be conducted on the mailing list not through pr comments for the same reason please do not simply file an issue or pr and walk away the most likely outcome is that it will never get seen or addressed requesting membership you do not need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on the mailing list to become a voting member you must send an email to the mailing list the subject line should read membership request your name project name the body should include your name the name of and link to the project you represent and other details you feel are relevant current members will vote on your request do not combine separate membership requests in a single thread one request per thread please language translations all psrs are written in british english or american english different specifications may vary but it is consistent within the same specification the php fig does not offer official translations into other languages but other external entities are free to translate the specifications in accordance with the license voting members the current list of voting members is available on the project website
