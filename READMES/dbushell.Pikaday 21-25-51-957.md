production ready since version 1 0 0 pikaday is stable and used in production if you do however find bugs or have feature requests please submit them to the github issue tracker also see the changelog installation npm install pikaday usage pikaday can be bound to an input field html input type text id datepicker add the javascript to the end of your document html script src pikaday js script script var picker new pikaday field document getelementbyid datepicker script if youre using jquery make sure to pass only the first element javascript var picker new pikaday field datepicker 0 if the pikaday instance is not bound to a field you can append the element anywhere javascript var field document getelementbyid datepicker var picker new pikaday onselect function date field value picker tostring field parentnode insertbefore picker el field nextsibling formatting by default dates are formatted and parsed using standard javascript date object if moment js is available in scope it will be used to format and parse input values you can pass an additional format option to the configuration which will be passed to the moment constructor see the moment js example for a full version html var picker new pikaday field document getelementbyid datepicker format d mmm yyyy onselect function console log this getmoment format do mmmm yyyy for more advanced and flexible formatting you can pass your own tostring function to the configuration which will be used to format the date object this function has the following signature tostring date format yyyy mm dd you should return a string from it be careful though if the formatted string that you return cannot be correctly parsed by the date parse method or by moment if it is available then you must provide your own parse function in the config this function will be passed the formatted string and the format tostring datestring format yyyy mm dd javascript var picker new pikaday field document getelementbyid datepicker format d m yyyy tostring date format you should do formatting based on the passed format but we will just return d m yyyy for simplicity const day date getdate const month date getmonth 1 const year date

different element to trigger opening the datepicker see trigger example default to field bound automatically show hide the datepicker on field focus default true if field is set arialabel data attribute on the input field with an aria assistance tekst only applied when bound is set position preferred position of the datepicker relative to the form field e g top right bottom right note automatic adjustment may occur to avoid datepicker from being displayed outside the viewport see positions example default to bottom left reposition can be set to false to not reposition datepicker within the viewport forcing it to take the configured position default true container dom node to render calendar into see container example default undefined format the default output format for tostring and field value requires moment js for custom formatting formatstrict the default flag for moments strict date parsing requires moment js for custom formatting tostring date format function which will be used for custom formatting this function will take precedence over moment parse datestring format function which will be used for parsing input string and getting a date object from it this function will take precedence over moment defaultdate the initial date to view when first opened setdefaultdate make the defaultdate the initial selected value firstday first day of the week 0 sunday 1 monday etc mindate the minimum earliest date that can be selected this should be a native date object e g new date or moment todate maxdate the maximum latest date that can be selected this

true onselect callback function for when a date is selected onopen callback function for when the picker becomes visible onclose callback function for when the picker is hidden ondraw callback function for when the picker draws a new month keyboardinput enable keyboard input support default true styling if the reposition configuration option is enabled default pikaday will apply css classes to the datepicker according to how it is positioned top aligned left aligned right aligned bottom aligned note that the dom element at any time will typically have 2 css classes eg top aligned right aligned etc jquery plugin the normal version of pikaday does not require jquery however there is a jquery plugin if that floats your boat see plugins pikaday jquery js in the repository this version requires jquery naturally and can be used like other plugins see the jquery example for a full version html p p activate datepickers for all elements with a class of code datepicker code datepicker pikaday firstday 1 p p chain a few methods for the first datepicker jquery style datepicker eq 0 pikaday show pikaday gotoyear 2042 p p amd support if you use a modular script loader than pikaday is not bound to the global object and will fit nicely in your build process you can require pikaday just like any other module see the amd example for a full version javascript require pikaday function pikaday var picker new pikaday field document getelementbyid datepicker the same applies for the jquery plugin mentioned above see the jquery amd example for a full version javascript require jquery

picker getdate returns a basic javascript date object of the selected day or null if no selection picker setdate 2015 01 01 set the current selection this will be restricted within the bounds of mindate and maxdate options if theyre specified you can optionally pass a boolean as the second parameter to prevent triggering of the onselect callback true allowing the date to be set silently picker getmoment returns a moment js object for the selected date moment must be loaded before pikaday picker setmoment moment 14th february 2014 ddo mmmm yyyy set the current selection with a moment

it will not support picking a time of day however there have been efforts to add time support to pikaday see 1 and 18 these reside in their own fork you can use the work owenmead did most recently at owenmead pikaday a more simple time selection approach done by xeeali at xeeali pikaday is based on version 1 2 0 also stas has a fork stas pikaday but is now quite old browser compatibility ie 7
