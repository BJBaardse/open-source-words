apache kafka see our web site for details on the project you need to have gradle and java installed kafka requires gradle 4 5 or higher java 8 should be used for building in order to support both java 8 and java 10 at runtime first bootstrap and download the wrapper cd kafka source dir gradle now everything else will work build a jar and run it gradlew jar follow instructions in http kafka apache

can run gradlew releasetargz x signarchives the release file can be found inside core build distributions cleaning the build gradlew clean running a task on a particular version of scala either 2 11 x or 2 12 x note that if building the jars with a version other than 2 11 12 you need to set the scala version variable or change it in bin kafka run class sh to run the quick start you can pass either the major version eg 2 11 or the full version eg 2 11 12 gradlew pscalaversion 2 11 jar gradlew pscalaversion 2 11 test gradlew pscalaversion 2 11 releasetargz running a task for a specific project this is for core examples and clients gradlew core jar gradlew core test listing all gradle tasks gradlew tasks building ide project note that this is not strictly necessary intellij idea has good built in support for gradle projects for example gradlew eclipse gradlew idea the eclipse task has been configured to use project dir build eclipse as eclipses build directory eclipses default build directory project dir bin clashes with kafkas scripts directory and we dont use gradles build directory to avoid known issues with this configuration building the jar for all scala versions and for all projects gradlew jarall running unit integration tests for all scala versions and for all projects gradlew testall building a binary release gzipped tar ball for all scala versions gradlew releasetargzall publishing the jar for all version of scala and for all projects to maven gradlew uploadarchivesall please note for this to work you should create update gradle user home gradle properties typically gradle gradle properties and assign the following variables mavenurl mavenusername mavenpassword signing keyid signing password signing secretkeyringfile publishing the streams quickstart archetype artifact to maven for the streams archetype project one cannot use gradle to upload to maven instead the mvn deploy command needs to be called at the quickstart folder cd streams quickstart mvn deploy please note for this to work you should create update user maven settings typically user home m2 settings xml to assign the following variables settings xmlns http maven apache org settings 1 0 0 xmlns xsi http www w3 org 2001 xmlschema instance xsi schemalocation http maven apache org settings 1 0 0 https maven apache org xsd settings 1 0 0 xsd servers server id apache

servers installing the jars to the local maven repository gradlew installall building the test jar gradlew testjar determining how transitive dependencies are added gradlew core dependencies configuration runtime determining if any dependencies could be updated gradlew dependencyupdates running code quality checks there are two code quality analysis tools that we regularly run findbugs and checkstyle checkstyle checkstyle enforces a consistent coding style in kafka you can run checkstyle using gradlew checkstylemain checkstyletest the checkstyle warnings will be found in reports checkstyle reports main html and reports checkstyle reports test html files in the subproject build directories they are also are printed to the console the build will fail if checkstyle fails findbugs findbugs uses static analysis to look for bugs in the code you can run findbugs using gradlew findbugsmain findbugstest x test the findbugs warnings will be found in reports findbugs main html and reports findbugs test html files in the subproject build directories use pxmlfindbugsreport true to generate an xml report instead of an html one common build options the following options should be set with a p switch for example gradlew pmaxparallelforks 1 test commitid sets the build commit id as git head might not be correct if there are local commits added for build purposes mavenurl sets the url of the maven deployment repository file path to repo can be used to point to a local repository maxparallelforks limits the maximum number of processes for each task showstandardstreams shows standard out and standard error of the test jvm s on the console skipsigning skips signing of artifacts testloggingevents unit test events to be logged separated by comma for example gradlew ptestloggingevents started passed skipped failed test xmlfindbugsreport enable xml reports for findbugs this also disables html reports as only one can be enabled at a time running in
