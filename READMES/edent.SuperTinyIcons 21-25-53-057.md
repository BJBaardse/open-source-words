smallious bytes cost money they cost money to store transport and process simplicity should be our goal in all endeavours scream if you want to go smaller these files were edited by hand in inkscape then were minified using svgo and svgcleaner further smallification may be possible try it each of these has an xmlns http www w3 org 2000 svg in the svg tag this isnt strictly necessary but some web browsers wont display them as an image without it rounded corners can be dropped rx 80 the effect can be done in css if you want the background colour can also be excluded if youre including it elsewhere colours can be simplified ff0000 becomes red the precision of the paths is mostly 0 decimal places a few logos have 1 or 2 dp to make them look more accurate the precision can be reduced if necessary think you can make them smaller tell me by raising an issue want more icons tell me by raising an issue think the icons look wrong compare them against the official logos if they still look wrong tell me by raising an issue new icons also available in android vector drawables so you can easily use them in android apps converted using https inloop github io svg2android not guaranteed to be under 1kb submitting icons id love you to submit something ðŸ˜¸ the rules are simple your icon must be under 1024 bytes that is the maximum file size is 1023 bytes no arguments fit inside a circle

the svg elements as images in the browsers accessibility tree aria label xyz where xyz is the icons brand name to give the icon an accessible name note if using the svg as the src for an img element the alt attribute should still be used on the img element because the aria is not recognised in this context css tricks has also an article about accessible svg icons guidelines this is the standard guideline use this to help with sizing your icons and they will look good no matter what border radius is chosen green is the safe zone where the main body of the icon should be yellow is like a road shoulder it is there if more space is needed it should be used for protruding elements like corners or ornaments red is off limits it should not be touched by the icons red is also how a circular icon
