for specific file types usually dont have too much code in plugin directory you might want to examine the output of vim startuptime before applying the option post update hooks there are some plugins that require extra steps after installation or update in that case use do option to describe the task to be performed vim plug shougo vimproc vim do make plug valloric youcompleteme do install py if the value starts with it will be recognized as a vim command vim plug fatih vim go do goinstallbinaries if you need more control you can pass a reference to a vim function that takes a single argument vim function buildycm info info is a dictionary with 3 fields name name of the plugin status installed updated or unchanged force set on pluginstall or plugupdate if a info status installed a info force install py endif endfunction plug valloric youcompleteme do function buildycm both forms of post update hook are executed inside the directory of the plugin and only run when the repository has changed but you can force it to run unconditionally with the bang versions of the commands pluginstall and plugupdate make sure to escape bars and double quotes when you write do option inline as they are mistakenly recognized as command separator or the start of the trailing comment vim plug junegunn fzf do yes \ install but you can avoid the escaping if you extract the inline specification using a variable or any vimscript expression as follows vim let g fzf install yes install plug junegunn fzf do g fzf install pluginstall and plugupdate the installer takes the following steps when installing updating a plugin git clone or git fetch from its origin check out branch tag or commit and optionally git merge remote branch if the plugin was updated or installed for the first time
