go kit go kit is a programming toolkit for building microservices or elegant monoliths in go we solve common problems in distributed systems and application architecture so you can focus on delivering business value website gokit io mailing list go kit slack gophers slack com go kit invite motivation go has emerged as the language of the server but it remains underrepresented in so called modern enterprise companies like facebook twitter netflix and soundcloud many of these organizations have turned to jvm based stacks for their business logic owing in large part to libraries and ecosystems that directly support their microservice architectures to reach its next level of success go needs more than simple primitives and idioms it needs a comprehensive toolkit for coherent distributed programming in the large go kit is a set of packages and best practices which provide a comprehensive robust and trustable way of building microservices for organizations of any size for more details see the website the motivating blog post and the video of the talk see also the go kit talk at gophercon 2015 goals operate in a heterogeneous soa — expect to interact with mostly non go kit services rpc as the primary messaging pattern pluggable serialization and transport — not just json over http operate within existing infrastructures — no mandates for specific tools or technologies non goals supporting messaging patterns other than rpc for now — e g mpi pub sub cqrs etc re implementing functionality that can be provided by adapting existing software having opinions on operational concerns deployment configuration process supervision orchestration etc contributing please see contributing md thank you contributors dependency management go kit is a library designed to be imported into a binary package vendoring is currently the best way for binary package authors to ensure reliable reproducible builds therefore we strongly recommend our users use vendoring for all of their dependencies including go kit to avoid compatibility and availability issues go kit doesnt vendor its own dependencies and doesnt recommend use of third party import proxies there are several tools which make vendoring easier including dep gb glide gvt and govendor in addition go kit uses a variety of continuous integration providers to find and fix compatibility problems as soon as they occur related projects projects with a ★ have had particular influence on go kits design or vice versa service frameworks gizmo a microservice toolkit from the new york times ★ go micro a microservices client server library ★ gotalk async peer communication protocol library kite a micro service framework gocircuit dynamic cloud orchestration individual components afex hystrix go client side latency and fault tolerance library armon go metrics library for exporting performance and runtime metrics to external metrics systems codahale lunk structured logging in the style of googles dapper or twitters zipkin eapache go resiliency resiliency patterns sasbury logging a tagged style of logging grpc grpc go http 2 based rpc inconshreveable log15 simple powerful logging for go ★ mailgun vulcand programmatic load balancer backed by etcd mattheath phosphor distributed system tracing pivotal golang lager an opinionated logging library rubyist circuitbreaker circuit breaker library sirupsen logrus structured pluggable logging for go ★ sourcegraph appdash application tracing system based on googles dapper spacemonkeygo monitor data collection monitoring instrumentation and zipkin client library streadway handy net http handler filters vitess rpcplus package rpc context context gdamore mangos nanomsg implementation in pure go web frameworks gorilla gin negroni goji martini beego revel considered harmful additional reading architecting for the cloud — netflix dapper a large scale distributed systems tracing infrastructure — google your server as a function pdf — twitter development supported by digitalocean
