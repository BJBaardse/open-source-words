browser the original version was used as a free companion tool to the arca database xtra a commercial product that embeds sqlite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data the original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard sqlite 2 x databases the resulting program was renamed sqlite database browser and released into the public domain by mauricio icons were contributed by raquel ravanini also from tabuleiro jens miltner jmiltner contributed the code to support sqlite 3 x databases for the 1 2 release pete morgan daffodil created an initial project on github with the code in 2012 where several contributors fixed and improved pieces over the years ren√© peinthor rp and martin kleusberg mkleusberg then became involved and have been the main driving force from that point justin clift justinclift helps out with testing on osx and started the new github com sqlitebrowser organisation on github john t haller of portableapps com fame created the new logo he based it on the tango icon set public domain in august 2014 the project was renamed to database browser for sqlite at the request of richard hipp creator of sqlite as the previous name was creating unintended support issues in september 2014 the project was renamed to db browser for sqlite to avoid confusion with an existing application called database browser
