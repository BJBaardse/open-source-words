free for dev developers and open source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers but it can be hard to find them all in order to make informed decisions this is a list of software saas paas iaas etc and other offerings that have free tiers for developers the scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure developers system administrator devops practitioners etc are likely to find useful we love all the free services out there but it would be good to keep it on topic its a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated do not be offended if i do not accept your contribution you can help by sending pull requests to add more services once i have a good set of links in this readme file ill look into a better layout for the information and links help with that is appreciated too note this list is only for as a service offerings not for self hosted software for a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial if the free tier is time bucketed it has to be at least a year table of contents source code repos artifact repos tools for teams and collaboration code quality code search and
