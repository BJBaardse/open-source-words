this project has reached the end of its development as a simple neural network library feel free to browse the code but please use other javascript neural network libraries in development like brain js and convnetjs brain brain is a javascript neural network library heres an example of using it to approximate the xor function javascript var net new brain neuralnetwork net train input 0 0 output 0 input 0 1 output 1 input 1 0 output 1 input 1 1 output 0 var output net run 1 0 0 987 theres no reason to use a neural network to figure out xor however so heres a more involved realistic example demo training a neural network to recognize color contrast using in node if you have node you can install with npm npm install brain using in the browser download the latest brain js training is computationally expensive so you should try to train the network offline or on a worker and use the tofunction or tojson options to plug the pre trained network in to your website training use train to train the network with an array of training data the network has to be trained with all the data in bulk in one call to train the more training patterns the longer it will probably take to train but the better the network will be at classifiying new patterns data format each training pattern should have an input and an output both of which can be either an array of numbers from 0 to 1 or a hash of numbers from 0 to 1 for the color constrast demo it looks something like this javascript var net new brain neuralnetwork net train input r 0 03 g 0 7 b 0 5 output black 1 input r 0 16 g 0 09 b 0 2 output white 1 input r 0 5 g 0 5 b 1 0 output white 1 var output net run r 1 g 0 4 b 0 white 0 99 black 0 002 options train takes a hash of options as its second argument javascript net train data errorthresh 0 005 error threshold to reach iterations 20000 maximum training iterations log true console log progress periodically logperiod 10 number of iterations between logging learningrate 0 3 learning rate the network will train until the training error has gone below the threshold default 0 005 or the max number of iterations default 20000 has been reached whichever comes first by default training wont let you know how its doing until the end but set log to true to get periodic updates on the current training error of the network the training error should decrease every time the updates will be printed to console if you set log to a function this function will be called with the updates instead of printing to the console the learning rate is a parameter that influences how quickly the network trains its a number from 0 to 1 if the learning rate is close to 0 it will take longer to train if the learning rate is closer to 1 it will train faster but its in danger of training to a local minimum and performing badly on new data the default learning rate is 0 3 output the output of train is a hash of information about how the training went javascript error 0 0039139985510105032 training error iterations 406 training iterations failing if the network failed to train the error will be above the error threshold this could happen because the training data is too noisy most likely the network doesnt have enough hidden layers or nodes to handle the complexity of the data or it hasnt trained for enough iterations if the training error is still something huge like 0 4 after 20000 iterations its a good sign that the network cant make sense of the data youre giving it json serialize or load in the state of a trained network with json javascript var json net tojson net fromjson json you can also get a custom standalone function from a trained network that acts just like run javascript var run net tofunction var output run r 1 g 0 4 b 0 console log run tostring copy and paste no need to import brain js options neuralnetwork takes a hash of options javascript var net new brain neuralnetwork hiddenlayers 4 learningrate 0 6 global learning rate useful when training using streams hiddenlayers specify the number of hidden layers in the network and the size of each layer for example if you want two hidden layers the first with 3 nodes and the second with 4 nodes youd give hiddenlayers 3 4 by default brain uses one hidden layer with size proportionate to the size of the input array streams the network now has a writestream you can train the network by using pipe to send the training data to the network example refer to stream example js for an example on how to train the network with a stream initialization to train the network using a stream you must first create the stream by calling net createtrainstream which takes the following options floodcallback the callback function to re populate the stream this gets called on every training iteration donetrainingcallback info the callback function to execute when the network is done training the info param will contain a hash of information about how the training went javascript error 0 0039139985510105032 training error iterations 406 training iterations transform use a transform to coerce the data into the correct format you might also use a transform stream to normalize your data on the fly
