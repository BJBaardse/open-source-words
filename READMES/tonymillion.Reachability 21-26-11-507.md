warning there have been reports of apps being rejected when reachability is used in a framework the only solution to this so far is to rename the class reachability this is a drop in replacement for apples reachability class it is arc compatible and it uses the new gcd methods to notify of network interface changes in addition to the standard nsnotification it supports the use of blocks for when the network becomes reachable and unreachable finally you can specify whether a wwan connection is considered reachable do not open bugs until you have tested on device before you open a bug about ios6 ios5 build errors use tag 3 2 or 3 1 as they support assign types requirements once you have added the h m files to your project simply go to the project targets build phases link binary with libraries press the plus in the lower left of the list add systemconfiguration framework boom youre done examples block example this sample uses blocks to notify when the interface state has changed the blocks will be called on a background thread so you need to dispatch ui updates onto the main thread in objective c objc allocate a reachability object reachability reach reachability reachabilitywithhostname www google com set the blocks reach reachableblock reachability reach keep in mind this is called on a background thread and if you are updating the ui it needs to happen on the main thread like this dispatch async dispatch get main queue nslog reachable reach unreachableblock reachability reach nslog unreachable start the notifier which will cause the reachability object to retain itself reach startnotifier in swift 3 swift import reachability var reach reachability func application application uiapplication didfinishlaunchingwithoptions launchoptions uiapplicationlaunchoptionskey any bool allocate a reachability object self reach reachability forinternetconnection set the blocks self reach reachableblock reach reachability void in keep in mind this is called on a background thread and if you are updating the ui it needs to happen on the main thread like this dispatchqueue main async print reachable self reach unreachableblock reach reachability void in print unreachable self reach startnotifier return true nsnotification example this sample will use nsnotifications to notify when the interface has changed they will be delivered on the main thread so you can do ui updates from within the function in addition it asks the reachability object to consider the wwan 3g edge cdma as a non reachable connection you might use this if you are writing a video streaming app for example to save the users data plan in objective c objc allocate a reachability object reachability reach reachability reachabilitywithhostname www google com tell the reachability that we dont want to be reachable on 3g edge cdma reach reachableonwwan no here we set up a nsnotification observer the reachability that caused the notification is passed in the object parameter nsnotificationcenter defaultcenter addobserver self selector selector reachabilitychanged name kreachabilitychangednotification object nil reach startnotifier in swift 3 swift import reachability var reach reachability func application application uiapplication didfinishlaunchingwithoptions launchoptions uiapplicationlaunchoptionskey any bool allocate a reachability object self reach reachability forinternetconnection tell the reachability that we dont want to be reachable on 3g edge cdma self reach reachableonwwan false here we set up a nsnotification observer the reachability that caused the notification is passed in the object parameter notificationcenter default addobserver self selector selector reachabilitychanged name nsnotification name reachabilitychanged object nil self reach startnotifier return true func reachabilitychanged notification nsnotification if self reach isreachableviawifi self reach isreachableviawwan print service avalaible else print no service avalaible tell the world head over to projects using reachability and add your project for maximum wins
