how to prepare system design questions for an it company system design is a very broad topic even a software engineer with many years of working experience at a top it company may not be an expert on system design if you want to become an expert you need to read many books articles and solve real large scale system design problems this repository only teaches you how to handle the system design interview with a systematic approach in a short time you can dive into each topic if you have time of course welcome to add your thoughts table of contents system design interview tips basic knowledge about system design company engineering blogs products and systems hot questions and reference good books object oriented design ⬆ system design interview tips clarify the constraints and identify the user cases spend a few minutes questioning the interviewer and agreeing on the scope of the system remember to make sure you know all the requirements the interviewer didnt tell you about in the beginning user cases indicate the main functions of the system and constraints list the scale of the system such as requests per second requests types data written per second data read per second high level architecture design sketch the important components and the connections between them but dont go into some details usually a scalable system includes webserver load balancer service service partition database primary secondary database cluster plug cache component design for each component you need to write the specific apis for each component you may need to finish the detailed ood design for a particular function you may also need to design the database schema for the database ⬆ basic knowledge about system design here are some articles about system design related topics how to rock a systems design interview system interview scalability for dummies scalable web architecture and distributed systems numbers everyone should know fallacies of distributed systems scalable system design patterns introduction to architecting systems for scale transactions across datacenters a plain english introduction to cap theorem the cap faq paxos made simple consistent hashing nosql patterns scalability availability stability patterns of course if you want to dive into system related topics here is a good collection of reading list about services engineering and a good collection of material about distributed systems ⬆ company engineering blogs if you are going to have an onsite with a company you should read their engineering blog high scalability the github blog engineering

systems ⬆ object oriented design tips for ood interview clarify the scenario write out user cases use case is a description of sequences of events that taken together lead to a system doing something useful who is going to use it and how they are going to use it the system may be very simple or very complicated special system requirements such as multi threading read or write oriented define objects map identity to class one scenario for one class each core object in this scenario for one class consider the relationships among classes certain class must have unique instance one object has many other objects composition one object is another object inheritance identify attributes for each class change noun to variable and action to methods use design patterns such that it can be reused in multiple applications useful websites 101 design patterns tips for developers
