a lightweight yet powerful color framework for ios objective c swift it is built on the idea that software applications should function effortlessly while simultaneously maintaining their beautiful interfaces with chameleon you can easily stop tinkering with rgb values wasting hours figuring out the right color combinations to use in your app and worrying about whether your text will be readable on the various background colors of your app features app showcase in an upcoming update well begin showcasing some of the best apps and companies making use of chameleon if youd like to see your app

different classes of flat color schemes that can be generated from a flat or non flat color in the examples below the white stars indicate the color used to generate the schemes analogous flat color scheme complementary flat color scheme triadic flat color scheme contrasting text with a plethora of color choices available for text its difficult to choose one that all users will appreciate and be able to read whether youre in doubt of your text and tint color choices or afraid to let users customize their profile colors because it may disturb the legibility or usability of the app you no longer have to worry with chameleon you can ensure that all text stands out independent of the background color oh chameleon works with the status bar as well themes chameleon now allows you easily theme your app with as little as one line of code you can set a theme for all your views and for specific views as well colors from images chameleon allows you to seamlessly extract non flat or flat color schemes from images without hassle you can also generate the average color from an image with ease you can now mold the ui colors of a profile or product based on an image gradient colors with ios 7 8 apple mainstreamed flat colors now with the release of ios 9 chameleon strives to elevate the game once more say hello to gradient colors using one line of code you can easily set any objects color properties to a gradient background colors text colors tint colors etc other features like chameleons contrasting feature can also be applied to create a seamless product experimentation is encouraged and gutsiness is applauded xcode quick help documentation chameleons documentation while written as clearly and concisely as possible may still render some slightly confused but dont fret staying true to our vision of simplifying the entire color process we added xcode quick helps documentation support simply highlight a chameleon method or tap it with three fingers to find out more about what it is and what it does palettes if youre like us and love to use storyboards chameleons got you covered weve provided you with a quick and easy way to access chameleon colors right from

contrasting colors the contrasting color feature returns either a dark color a light color depending on what the chameleon algorithm believes is a better choice you can specify whether the dark or light colors are flat uicolor flatwhitecolor uicolor flatblackcolordark or non flat uicolor whitecolor uicolor blackcolor if youre trying to set a uilabels textcolor property make sure you provide the

superimpose smart contrasting text thankfully chameleon takes care of that for you weve introduced a new way to have multicolored objects and thats with gradients gradient styles chameleon provides three simple gradient styles gradients can be created from any number of colors you desire as long as at least two colors are provided dont forget that the contrasting text feature is also compatible

from images chameleon now supports the extraction of colors from images you can either generate both flat and non flat color schemes from an image or easily extract the average color to generate a

overlook this aspect of a beautiful app the status bar style chameleon has done something no other framework has it has created a new status bar style uistatusbarstylecontrast whether you have a viewcontroller embedded in a navigationcontroller or not you can do the following normal convention objective c objective c self setstatusbarstyle uistatusbarstylecontrast swift swift self setstatusbarstyle uistatusbarstylecontrast note make sure that the key view controller based status bar appearance in info plist is set to yes color schemes methods note due to the limited number of flat colors currently available color schemes may return results that reuse certain flat colors because of this redundancy we have provided an option to return either a flat color scheme or a non flat color scheme until more flat colors are added to the inventory the initial color can be either a non flat color or flat color chameleon will return an nsarray of 5 uicolors in which the original color will be the third object of the scheme this allows for chameleon to designate the colors of the color scheme 2 colors counter clockwise and 2 clockwise from the initial color and thus the chosen colors are aligned specifically in that order analogous color scheme an analogous color scheme uses three adjacent colors on the color wheel according to wikipedia its best used with either warm or cool colors creating a cohesive collection with certain temperature qualities as well as proper color harmony however this particular scheme lacks contrast and is less vibrant than complementary schemes within the scheme choose one color to dominate and two to support the remaining two colors should be used along with black white or gray as accents complementary color scheme a complementary color scheme uses opposite colors on the color wheel to put into slightly more technical terms they are two colors that when combined produce a neutral color complementary colors are tricky to use extensively but work well when you want a point of emphasis complementary colors are generally not favorable to use for text triadic color scheme a triadic scheme uses evenly spaced colors on the color wheel the colors tend to be richly vivid and offer a higher degree of contrast while at the same time retain color harmony let one color dominate and use the two others for accent getting colors in a color scheme to retrieve an array of colors first make sure to initialize an nsmutablearray in case you want to use the same array to replace with different colors later normal convention

three methods to get you started contentstyle allows you to decide whether text and a few other elements should be white black or whichever contrasts more over any ui elements backgroundcolor to set a global theme you can do the following in your app delegate normal convention objective c objective c chameleon setglobalthemeusingprimarycolor uicolor color withcontentstyle uicontentstyle contentstyle but what if you want a different theme for a specific uiviewcontroller no problem chameleon allows you to override the global theme in any uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller by simply doing the following normal convention objective c objective c this would go in the controller you specifically want to theme differently self setthemeusingprimarycolor flatmint withsecondarycolor flatblue andcontentstyle uicontentstylecontrast note in order for the status bar style to automatically be set using a theme you need to make sure that the view controller based status bar appearance key in info plist is set to no navigation bar hairline as of 2 0 3 the navigation bar hairline view is no longer hidden by default however if youre seeking a true flat look like the image above you can hide the hairline at the bottom of the navigation bar by doing the following objective c objective c self navigationcontroller sethidesnavigationbarhairline yes or self
