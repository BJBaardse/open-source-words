better errors better errors replaces the standard rails error page with a much better and more useful error page it is also usable outside of rails in any rack app as rack middleware features for screenshots of these features see the wiki full stack trace source code inspection for all stack frames with highlighting local and instance variable inspection live shell repl on every stack frame links directly to the source line in your editor useful information in non html requests installation add this to your gemfile ruby group development do gem better errors gem binding of caller end binding of caller is optional but is necessary to use better errors advanced features repl local instance variable inspection pretty stack frame names note if you discover that better errors isnt working particularly after upgrading from version 0 5 0 or less be sure to set config consider all requests local true in config environments development rb security note it is critical you put better errors only in the development section of your gemfile do not run better errors in production or on internet facing hosts you will notice that the only machine that gets the better errors page is localhost which means you get the default error page if you are developing on a remote host or a virtually remote host such as a vagrant box obviously the repl is not something you want to expose to the public and there may be sensitive information available in the backtrace for more information on how to configure access see the wiki usage if youre using rails theres nothing else you need to do using without rails if youre not using rails you need to insert bettererrors middleware into your middleware stack and optionally set bettererrors application root if youd like better errors to abbreviate filenames within your application for instructions for your specific middleware see the wiki plain text requests better errors will render a plain text error page when the request is an xmlhttprequest or when the accept header does not include html unicorn puma and other multi worker servers better errors works by leaving a lot of context in server process memory if youre using a web server that runs multiple workers its likely that a second request as happens when you click on a stack frame will hit a different worker that worker wont have the necessary context in memory and youll see a session expired message if this is the case for you consider turning the number of workers to one 1 in development another option would be to use webrick mongrel thin or another single process server as your rails server when you are trying to troubleshoot an issue in development changing the link to your editor better errors includes a link to your editor for the file and line of code that is being shown by default it uses your environment to determine which editor should be opened see the wiki for instructions on configuring the editor set maximum variable size for inspector ruby e g in config initializers better errors rb this will stop bettererrors from trying to render larger objects which can cause slow loading times and browser performance problems stated size is in characters and refers to the length of inspects payload for the given object please be aware that html escaping modifies the size of this payload so setting this limit too precisely is not recommended default value 100 000 bettererrors maximum variable inspect size 100 000 get in touch if youre using better errors id love to hear from you drop me a line and tell me what you think development after checking out the repo run bundle install to install the basic dependencies you can run the tests with the simplest set of dependencies using rb bundle exec rspec to run specs for each of the dependency combinations run rb bundle exec rake test all you can run specs for a specific dependency combination using rb bundle gemfile gemfiles pry09 gemfile bundle exec rspec on ci the specs are run against each gemfile on each supported version of ruby contributing fork it create your feature branch git checkout b my new feature commit your changes git commit am add some feature push to the branch git push origin my new feature create new pull request
