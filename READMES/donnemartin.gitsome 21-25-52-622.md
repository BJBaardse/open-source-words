an official integration for github and github enterprise gitsome why gitsome the git command line although the standard git command line is a great tool to manage your git powered repos it can be tough to remember the usage of 150 porcelain and plumbing commands countless command specific options resources such as tags and branches the git command line does not integrate with github forcing you to toggle between command line and browser gitsome a supercharged git github cli with autocomplete gitsome aims to supercharge your standard git shell interface by focusing on improving ease of use increasing productivity deep github integration not all github workflows work well in a terminal gitsome attempts to target those that do gitsome includes 29 github integrated commands that work with all shells gh command param options quick reference general reference run gh commands along with git extras and hub commands to unlock even more github integrations git and github autocompleter with interactive help you can run the optional shell gitsome to enable autocompletion and interactive help for the following git commands git options git branches tags etc git extras commands github integration commands general autocompleter gitsome autocompletes the following shell commands files and directories environment variables man pages python to enable additional autocompletions check

detailed listing of all github integration commands parameters options and examples having trouble remembering these commands check out the handy autocompleter with interactive help to guide you through each command note you can combine gitsome with other utilities such as git extras installation pip installation gitsome is hosted on pypi the following command will install gitsome pip3 install gitsome you can also install the latest gitsome from github source which can contain changes not yet pushed to pypi pip3 install git https github com donnemartin gitsome git if you are not installing in a virtualenv you might need to run with sudo sudo pip3 install gitsome pip3 depending on your setup you might also want to run pip3 with the h flag sudo h pip3 install gitsome for most linux users pip3 can be installed on your system using the python3 pip package for example ubuntu users can run sudo apt get install python3 pip see this ticket for more details virtual environment installation you can install python packages in a virtualenv to avoid potential issues with dependencies or permissions if you are a windows user or if you would like more details on virtualenv check out this guide install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper pip3 install virtualenv pip3 install virtualenvwrapper export workon home virtualenvs source usr local bin virtualenvwrapper sh create a gitsome virtualenv and install gitsome mkvirtualenv gitsome pip3 install gitsome if the pip install does not work you might be running python 2 by default check what version of python you are running python version if the call above results in python 2 find the path for python 3 which python3 python 3 path for mkvirtualenvs python option install python 3 if needed set the python version when calling mkvirtualenv mkvirtualenv python python 3 path from above gitsome pip3 install gitsome if you want to activate the gitsome virtualenv again later run workon gitsome to deactivate the gitsome virtualenv run deactivate running as a docker container you can run gitsome in a docker container to avoid installing python and pip3 locally to install docker check out the official docker documentation once you have docker installed you can run gitsome docker run ti rm mariolet gitsome you can use docker volumes to let gitsome access your working directory your local gitsomeconfig and gitconfig docker run ti rm v pwd src \ v home gitsomeconfig root gitsomeconfig \ v home gitconfig root gitconfig \ mariolet gitsome if you are running this command often you will probably want to define an alias alias gitsome docker run ti rm v pwd src \ v home gitsomeconfig root gitsomeconfig \ v home gitconfig root gitconfig \ mariolet gitsome to build the docker image from sources git clone https github com donnemartin gitsome git cd gitsome docker build t gitsome starting the gitsome shell once installed run the optional gitsome autocompleter with interactive help gitsome running the optional gitsome shell will provide you with autocompletion interactive help fish style suggestions a python repl etc running gh commands run github integrated commands gh command param options note running the gitsome shell is not required to execute gh commands after installing gitsome you can run gh commands from any shell running the gh configure command to properly integrate with github gitsome must be properly configured gh configure for github enterprise users run with the e enterprise flag gh configure e view more details in the gh configure section enabling bash completions by default gitsome looks at the following locations to enable bash completions to add additional bash completions update the xonshrc file with the location of your bash completions if xonshrc does not exist create it touch xonshrc for example if additional completions are found in usr local etc my bash completion d completion bash add the following line in xonshrc bash completions append usr local etc my bash completion d completion bash you will need to restart gitsome for the changes to take effect enabling gh tab completions outside of gitsome you can run gh commands outside of the gitsome shell completer to enable gh tab completions for this workflow copy the gh complete sh file locally let bash know completion is available for the gh command within your current session source path to gh complete sh to enable tab completion for all terminal sessions add the following to your bashrc file source path to gh complete sh reload your bashrc source bashrc tip is the short form of source so you can run this instead bashrc for zsh users zsh includes a module which is compatible with bash completions download the gh complete sh file as above and append the following to your zshrc autoload bashcompinit bashcompinit source path to gh complete sh reload your zshrc source zshrc optional installing pil or pillow displaying the avatar for the gh me and gh user commands will require installing the optional pil or pillow dependency windows and mac pip3 install pillow see the windows support section for limitations on the avatar ubuntu users check out these instructions on askubuntu supported python versions python 3 4 python 3 5 python 3 6 is not currently supported see this ticket for more information gitsome is powered by xonsh which does not currently support python 2 x as discussed in this ticket supported platforms mac os x tested on os x 10 10 linux unix tested on ubuntu 14 04 lts windows tested on windows 10 windows support gitsome has been tested on windows 10 with cmd and cmder although you can use the standard windows command prompt youll probably have a better experience with either cmder or conemu text only avatar the commands gh user and gh me will always have the t text avatar flag enabled since img2txt does not support the ansi avatar on windows config file on windows the gitsomeconfig file can be found in userprofile for example c \users\dmartin\ gitsomeconfig developer installation if youre interested in contributing to gitsome run the following commands git clone https github com donnemartin gitsome git cd gitsome pip3 install e pip3 install r requirements dev txt gitsome gh command param options pip3 if you get an error while installing saying that you need python 3 4 it could be because your pip command is configured for an older version of python to fix this issue it is recommended to install pip3 sudo apt get install python3 pip see this ticket for more details continuous integration continuous integration details are available on travis ci unit tests and code coverage run unit tests in your active python environment python tests run tests py run unit tests with tox on multiple python
