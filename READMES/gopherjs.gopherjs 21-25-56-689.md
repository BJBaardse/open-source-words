gopherjs a compiler from go to javascript gopherjs compiles go code golang org to pure javascript code its main purpose is to give you the opportunity to write front end code in go which will still run in all browsers playground give gopherjs a try on the gopherjs playground what is supported nearly everything including goroutines compatibility table performance is quite good in most cases see html5 game engine benchmark cgo is not supported installation and usage get or update gopherjs and dependencies with go get u github com gopherjs gopherjs now you can use gopherjs build package gopherjs build files or gopherjs install package which behave similar to the go tool for main packages these commands create a js file and js map source map in the current directory or in gopath bin the generated javascript file can be used as usual in a website use gopherjs help command to get a list of possible command line flags e g for minification and automatically watching for changes gopherjs uses your platforms default goos value when generating code supported goos values are linux darwin if youre on a different platform e g windows or freebsd youll need to set the goos environment variable to a supported value for example goos linux gopherjs build package note gopherjs will try to write compiled object files of the core packages to your goroot pkg directory if that fails it will fall back to gopath pkg gopherjs run gopherjs test if you want to use gopherjs run or gopherjs test to run the generated code locally install node js 10 0 0 or newer and the source map support module npm install global source map support on supported goos platforms its possible to make system calls file system access etc available see doc syscalls md for instructions on how to do so gopherjs serve gopherjs serve is a useful command you can use during development it will start an http server serving on 8080 by default then dynamically compile your go packages with gopherjs and serve them for example navigating to http localhost 8080 example com user project should compile and run the go package example com user project the generated javascript output will be served at http localhost 8080 example com user project project js the js file name will be equal to the base directory name if the directory contains index html it will be served otherwise a minimal index html that includes script src project js script will be provided causing the javascript to be executed all other static files will be served too refreshing in the browser will rebuild the served files if needed compilation errors will be displayed in terminal and in browser console additionally it will serve goroot and gopath for sourcemaps if you include an argument it will be the root from which everything is served for example if you run gopherjs serve github com user project then the generated javascript for the package github com user project mypkg will be served at http localhost 8080 mypkg mypkg js performance tips use the m command line flag to generate minified code apply gzip compression https en wikipedia org wiki http compression use int instead of u int8 16 32 64 use float64 instead of float32 community gopherjs channel on gophers slack invites to gophers slack are available here bindings to javascript apis and libraries gopherjs blog gopherjs on twitter getting started interacting with the dom the package github com gopherjs gopherjs js see documentation provides functions for interacting with native javascript apis for example the line js document write hello world would look like this in go go js global get document call write hello world you may also want use the dom bindings the jquery bindings see todomvc example or the angularjs bindings those are some of the bindings to javascript apis and libraries by community members providing library functions for use in other javascript code set a global variable to a map that contains the functions go package main import github com gopherjs gopherjs js func main js global set pet map string interface new new type pet struct name string func new name string js object return js makewrapper pet name func p pet name string return p name func p pet setname name string p name name for more details see jason stones blog post about gopherjs architecture general gopherjs emulates a 32 bit environment this means that int uint and uintptr have a precision of 32 bits however the explicit 64 bit integer types int64 and uint64 are supported the goarch value of gopherjs is js you may use it as a build constraint build js application lifecycle the main function is executed as usual after all init functions have run javascript callbacks can also invoke go functions even after the main function has exited therefore the end of the main function should not be regarded as the end of the application and does not end the execution of other goroutines in the browser calling os exit e g indirectly by log fatal also does not terminate the execution of the program for convenience it calls runtime goexit to immediately terminate the calling goroutine goroutines goroutines are fully supported by gopherjs the only restriction is that you need to start a new goroutine if you want to use blocking code called from external javascript go js global get mybutton call addeventlistener click func go func someblockingfunction how it works javascript has no concept of concurrency except web workers but those are too strictly separated to be used for goroutines because of that instructions in javascript are never blocking a blocking call would effectively freeze the responsiveness of your web page so calls with callback arguments are used instead gopherjs does some heavy lifting to work around this restriction whenever an instruction is blocking e g communicating with a channel that isnt ready the whole stack will unwind all functions return and the goroutine will be put to sleep then another goroutine which is ready to resume gets picked and its stack with all local variables will be restored gopherjs development if youre looking to make changes to the gopherjs compiler see developer
