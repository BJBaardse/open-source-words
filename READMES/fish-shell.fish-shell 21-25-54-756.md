an officially released tarball autoconf 2 60 and automake 1 13 are required doxygen 1 8 7 or later is also optionally required to build the documentation from a cloned git repository building from source all platforms using cmake preferred bash mkdir build cd build cmake add dcmake build type release for release build make sudo make install using autotools bash autoreconf no recursive if building from git configure make sudo make install building from source macos only build the base target in xcode run the fish executable for example in deriveddata fish build products debug base bin fish to build and install fish with xcode on macos execute the following in a terminal bash xcodebuild install sudo ditto tmp fish dst sudo make install doc help it didnt build if fish reports that it could not find curses try installing a curses development package and build again on debian or ubuntu you want sudo apt get install build essential ncurses dev libncurses5 dev gettext autoconf on redhat centos or amazon ec2 sudo yum install ncurses devel contributing changes to the code see the guide for developers contact us questions comments rants and raves can be posted to the official
