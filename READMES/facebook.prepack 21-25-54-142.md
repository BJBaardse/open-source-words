prepack prepack is a partial evaluator for javascript prepack rewrites a javascript bundle resulting in javascript code that executes more efficiently for initialization heavy code prepack works best in an environment where javascript parsing is effectively cached see the official prepack io website for an introduction and an interactive repl playground how to use prepack install the cli via npm bash npm install g prepack or if you prefer yarn make sure you get yarn first bash npm install g yarn and then install the prepack cli via yarn bash yarn global add prepack you may need to prepend pun intended the command with sudo in some cases let the party begin to compile a file and print the output to the console bash prepack script js if you want to compile a file and output to another file bash prepack script js out script processed js detailed instructions and the api can be found at prepack cli getting started plugins to other tools the following are a few plugins to other tools they have been created and are maintained separately from prepack itself if you run into any issues with those plugins please ask the plugin maintainers for support a rollup plugin for prepack a webpack plugin for prepack a parcel plugin for prepack a visual studio code plugin for prepack a babel plugin which transforms flow annotations into prepack model declarations status test262 status on master branch code coverage report for serialization tests to see the status for a pull request look for the message all checks have passed or all checks have failed click on show all checks details artifacts and then test262 status txt or coverage report sourcemapped index html how to get the code clone repository and make it your current directory git submodule init git submodule update init get yarn and node then do yarn note for development work you really need yarn as many scripts require it how to build lint type check get the code yarn build you can later run yarn watch in the background to just compile changed files on the fly yarn lint yarn flow how to run tests get the code make sure the code is built either by running yarn build or yarn watch yarn test you can run individual test suites as follows yarn test serializer this tests the interpreter and serializer all tests should pass yarn test test262 this tests conformance against the test262 suite not all will pass increasing conformance is work in progress how to run the interpreter get the code make sure the code is built either by running yarn build or yarn watch yarn repl this starts an interactive interpreter session how to run prepack get the code make sure the code is built either by running yarn build or yarn watch have a javascript file handy that you want to prepack for example echo function hello return hello function world return world s hello world tmp sample js cat tmp sample js yarn prepack cli try help for more options how to validate changes instead of building linting type checking testing separately the following does everything together yarn validate how to edit the website the content for prepack io resides in the website directory of this repository to make changes submit a pull request just like for any code changes in order to run the website locally at localhost 8000 1 build prepack into the website yarn build mv prepack min js website js 2 run python m simplehttpserver python 2 or python m http server python 3 from the website directory how to contribute to read more about the project check out this suggested reading wiki for more information about contributing pull requests and issues see our contribution guidelines license prepack is bsd licensed we also provide an additional patent grant
