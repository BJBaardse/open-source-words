üéâ ultra simplified explanation to design patterns üéâ a topic that can easily make anyones mind wobble here i try to make them stick in to your mind and maybe mine by explaining them in the simplest way possible check out my blog and say hi on twitter üöÄ introduction design patterns are solutions to recurring problems guidelines on how to tackle certain problems they are not classes packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen these are rather guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations design patterns are solutions to recurring problems guidelines on how to tackle certain problems wikipedia describes them as in software engineering a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design it is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations ‚ö†Ô∏è be careful design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems do not try to force them bad things are supposed to happen if done so keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems not solutions finding problems so dont overthink if used in a correct place in a correct manner they can prove to be a savior or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code also note that the code samples below are in php 7 however this shouldnt stop you because the concepts are same anyways plus the support for other languages is underway types of design patterns creational structural behavioral creational design patterns in plain words creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects wikipedia says in software engineering creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation the basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation simple factory factory method abstract factory builder prototype singleton üè† simple factory real world example consider you are building a house and you need doors it would be a mess if every time you need a door you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house instead you get it made from a factory in plain words simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client wikipedia says in object oriented programming oop a factory is an object for creating other objects ‚Äì formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call which is assumed to be new programmatic example first of all we have a door interface and the implementation php interface door public function getwidth float public function getheight float class woodendoor implements door protected width protected height public function construct float width float height this width width this height height public function getwidth float return this width public function getheight float return this height then we have our door factory that makes the door and returns itphp class doorfactory public static function makedoor width height door return new woodendoor width height and then it can be used asphp door doorfactory makedoor 100 200 echo width door getwidth echo height door getheight when to use when creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere üè≠ factory method real world example consider the case of a hiring manager it is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions based on the job opening she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people in plain words it provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes wikipedia says in class based programming the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created this is done by creating objects by calling a factory method‚Äîeither specified in an interface and implemented by child classes or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes‚Äîrather than by calling a constructor programmatic example taking our hiring manager example above first of all we have an interviewer interface and some implementations for it php interface interviewer public function askquestions class developer implements interviewer public function askquestions echo asking about design patterns class communityexecutive implements interviewer public function askquestions echo asking about community building now let us create our hiringmanager php abstract class hiringmanager factory method abstract protected function makeinterviewer interviewer public function takeinterview interviewer this makeinterviewer interviewer askquestions now any child can extend it and provide the required interviewerphp class developmentmanager extends hiringmanager protected function makeinterviewer interviewer return new developer class marketingmanager extends hiringmanager protected function makeinterviewer interviewer return new communityexecutive and then it can be used as php devmanager new developmentmanager devmanager takeinterview output asking about design patterns marketingmanager new marketingmanager marketingmanager takeinterview output asking about community building when to use useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub class is dynamically decided at runtime or putting it in other words when the client doesnt know what exact sub class it might need üî® abstract factory real world example extending our door example from simple factory based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop iron door from an iron shop or a pvc door from the relevant shop plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door for example a carpenter for wooden door welder for iron door etc as you can see there is a dependency between the doors now wooden door needs carpenter iron door needs a welder etc in plain words a factory of factories a factory that groups the individual but related dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes wikipedia says the abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes programmatic example translating the door example above first of all we have our door interface and some implementation for it php interface door public function getdescription class woodendoor implements door public function getdescription echo i am a wooden door class irondoor implements door public function getdescription echo i am an iron door then we have some fitting experts for each door type php interface doorfittingexpert public function getdescription class welder implements doorfittingexpert public function getdescription echo i can only fit iron doors class carpenter implements doorfittingexpert public function getdescription echo i can only fit wooden doors now we have our abstract factory that would let us make family of related objects i e wooden door factory would create a wooden door and wooden door fitting expert and iron door factory would create an iron door and iron door fitting expert php interface doorfactory public function makedoor door public function makefittingexpert doorfittingexpert wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door class woodendoorfactory implements doorfactory public function makedoor door return new woodendoor public function makefittingexpert doorfittingexpert return new carpenter iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert class irondoorfactory implements doorfactory public function makedoor door return new irondoor public function makefittingexpert doorfittingexpert return new welder and then it can be used asphp woodenfactory new woodendoorfactory door woodenfactory makedoor expert woodenfactory makefittingexpert door getdescription output i am a wooden door expert getdescription output i can only fit wooden doors same for iron factory ironfactory new irondoorfactory door ironfactory makedoor expert ironfactory makefittingexpert door getdescription output i am an iron door expert getdescription output i can only fit iron doors as you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the carpenter and the wooden door also iron door factory has encapsulated the iron door and welder and thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door we do not get a wrong fitting expert when to use when there are interrelated dependencies with not that simple creation logic involved üë∑ builder real world example imagine you are at hardees and you order a specific deal lets say big hardee and they hand it over to you without any questions this is the example of simple factory but there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps for example you want a customized subway deal you have several options in how your burger is made e g what bread do you want what types of sauces would you like what cheese would you want etc in such cases builder pattern comes to the rescue in plain words allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution useful when there could be several flavors of an object or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object wikipedia says the builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti pattern having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti pattern is at one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below php public function construct size cheese true pepperoni true tomato false lettuce true as you can see the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want to add more options in future this is called telescoping constructor anti pattern programmatic example the sane alternative is to use the builder pattern first of all we have our burger that we want to make php class burger protected size protected cheese false protected pepperoni false protected lettuce false protected tomato false public function construct burgerbuilder builder this size builder size this cheese builder cheese this pepperoni builder pepperoni this lettuce builder lettuce this tomato builder tomato and then we have the builder php class burgerbuilder public size public cheese false public pepperoni false public lettuce false public tomato false public function construct int size this size size public function addpepperoni this pepperoni true return this public function addlettuce this lettuce true return this public function addcheese this cheese true return this public function addtomato this tomato true return this public function build burger return new burger this and then it can be used as php burger new burgerbuilder 14 addpepperoni addlettuce addtomato build when to use when there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping the key difference from the factory pattern is that factory pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process üêë prototype real world example remember dolly the sheep that was cloned lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning in plain words create object based on an existing object through cloning wikipedia says the prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development it is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance which is cloned to produce new objects in short it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up programmatic example in php it can be easily done using clone php class sheep protected name protected category public function construct string name string category mountain sheep this name name this category category public function setname string name this name name public function getname return this name public function setcategory string category this category category public function getcategory return this category then it can be cloned like belowphp original new sheep jolly echo original getname jolly echo original getcategory mountain sheep clone and modify what is required cloned clone original cloned setname dolly echo cloned getname dolly echo cloned getcategory mountain sheep also you could use the magic method clone to modify the cloning behavior when to use when an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning üíç singleton real world example there can only be one president of a country at a time the same president has to be brought to action whenever duty calls president here is singleton in plain words ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created wikipedia says in software engineering the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object this is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system singleton pattern is actually considered an anti pattern and overuse of it should be avoided it is not necessarily bad and could have some valid use cases but should be used with caution because it introduces a global state in your application and change to it in one place could affect in the other areas and it could become pretty difficult to debug the other bad thing about them is it makes your code tightly coupled plus mocking the singleton could be difficult programmatic example to create a singleton make the constructor private disable cloning disable extension and create a static variable to house the instance php final class president private static instance private function construct hide the constructor public static function getinstance president if self instance self instance new self return self instance private function clone disable cloning private function wakeup disable unserialize then in order to usephp president1 president getinstance president2 president getinstance var dump president1 president2 true structural design patterns in plain words structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other or yet another explanation would be they help in answering how to build a software component wikipedia says in software engineering structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities adapter bridge composite decorator facade flyweight proxy üîå adapter real world example consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer in order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer in this case card reader is an adapter another example would be the famous power adapter a three legged plug cant be connected to a two pronged outlet it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another in plain words adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class wikipedia says in software engineering the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface it is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code programmatic example consider a game where there is a hunter and he hunts lions first we have an interface lion that all types of lions have to implement php interface lion public function roar class africanlion implements lion public function roar class asianlion implements lion public function roar and hunter expects any implementation of lion interface to hunt php class hunter public function hunt lion lion lion roar now lets say we have to add a wilddog in our game so that hunter can hunt that also but we cant do that directly because dog has a different interface to make it compatible for our hunter we will have to create an adapter that is compatible php this needs to be added to the game class wilddog public function bark adapter around wild dog to make it compatible with our game class wilddogadapter implements lion protected dog public function construct wilddog dog this dog dog public function roar this dog bark and now thewilddogcan be used in our game usingwilddogadapter php wilddog new wilddog wilddogadapter new wilddogadapter wilddog hunter new hunter hunter hunt wilddogadapter üö° bridge real world example consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow the user to change the theme what would you do create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the users preferences bridge pattern allows you to do the second i e in plain words bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy wikipedia says the bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently programmatic example translating our webpage example from above here we have the webpage hierarchy php interface webpage public function construct theme theme public function getcontent class about implements webpage protected theme public function construct theme theme this theme theme public function getcontent return about page in this theme getcolor class careers implements webpage protected theme public function construct theme theme this theme theme public function getcontent return careers page in this theme getcolor and the separate theme hierarchyphp interface theme public function getcolor class darktheme implements theme public function getcolor return dark black class lighttheme implements theme public function getcolor return off white class aquatheme implements theme public function getcolor return light blue and both the hierarchiesphp darktheme new darktheme about new about darktheme careers new careers darktheme echo about getcontent about page in dark black echo careers getcontent careers page in dark black üåø composite real world example every organization is composed of employees each of the employees has the same features i e has a salary has some responsibilities may or may not report to someone may or may not have some subordinates etc in plain words composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner wikipedia says in software engineering the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern the composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object the intent of a composite is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part whole hierarchies implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly programmatic example taking our employees example from above here we have different employee types php interface employee public function construct string name float salary public function getname string public function setsalary float salary public function getsalary float public function getroles array class developer implements employee protected salary protected name protected roles public function construct string name float salary this name name this salary salary public function getname string return this name public function setsalary float salary this salary salary public function getsalary float return this salary public function getroles array return this roles class designer implements employee protected salary protected name protected roles public function construct string name float salary this name name this salary salary public function getname string return this name public function setsalary float salary this salary salary public function getsalary float return this salary public function getroles array return this roles then we have an organization which consists of several different types of employees php class organization protected employees public function addemployee employee employee this employees employee public function getnetsalaries float netsalary 0 foreach this employees as employee netsalary employee getsalary return netsalary and then it can be used as php prepare the employees john new developer john doe 12000 jane new designer jane doe 15000 add them to organization organization new organization organization addemployee john organization addemployee jane echo net salaries organization getnetsalaries net salaries 27000 ‚òï decorator real world example imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services now how do you calculate the bill to be charged you pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost here each type of service is a decorator in plain words decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class wikipedia says in object oriented programming the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object either statically or dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class the decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the single responsibility principle as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern programmatic example lets take coffee for example first of all we have a simple coffee implementing the coffee interface php interface coffee public function getcost public function getdescription class simplecoffee implements coffee public function getcost return 10 public function getdescription return simple coffee we want to make the code extensible to allow options to modify it if required lets make some add ons decorators php class milkcoffee implements coffee protected coffee public function construct coffee coffee this coffee coffee public function getcost return this coffee getcost 2 public function getdescription return this coffee getdescription milk class whipcoffee implements coffee protected coffee public function construct coffee coffee this coffee coffee public function getcost return this coffee getcost 5 public function getdescription return this coffee getdescription whip class vanillacoffee implements coffee protected coffee public function construct coffee coffee this coffee coffee public function getcost return this coffee getcost 3 public function getdescription return this coffee getdescription

somecoffee echo somecoffee getcost 20 echo somecoffee getdescription simple coffee milk whip vanilla üì¶ facade real world example how do you turn on the computer hit the power button you say that is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen this simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade in plain words facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem wikipedia says a facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code such as a class library programmatic example taking our computer example from above here we have the computer class php class computer public function getelectricshock echo ouch public function makesound echo beep beep public function showloadingscreen echo loading public function bam echo ready to be used public function closeeverything echo bup bup bup buzzzz public function sooth echo zzzzz public function pullcurrent echo haaah here we have the facadephp class computerfacade protected computer public function construct computer computer this computer computer public function turnon this

now to use the facadephp computer new computerfacade new computer computer turnon ouch beep beep loading ready to be used computer turnoff bup bup buzzz haah zzzzz üçÉ flyweight real world example did you ever have fresh tea from some stall they often make more than one cup that you demanded and save the rest for any other customer so to save the resources e g gas etc flyweight pattern is all about that i e sharing in plain words it is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects wikipedia says in computer programming flyweight is a software design pattern a flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory programmatic example translating our tea example from above first of all we have tea types and tea maker php anything that will be cached is flyweight types of tea here will be flyweights class karaktea acts as a factory and saves the tea class teamaker protected availabletea public function make preference if empty this availabletea preference this availabletea preference new karaktea return this availabletea preference then we have the teashop which takes orders and serves them php class teashop protected orders protected teamaker public function construct teamaker teamaker this teamaker teamaker public function takeorder string teatype int table this orders table this teamaker make teatype public function serve foreach this orders as table tea echo serving tea to table table and it can be used as below php teamaker new teamaker shop new teashop teamaker shop takeorder less sugar 1 shop takeorder more milk 2 shop takeorder without sugar 5 shop serve serving tea to table 1 serving tea to table 2 serving tea to table 5 üé± proxy real world example have you ever used an access card to go through a door there are multiple options to open that door i e it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security the doors main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality let me better explain it using the code example below in plain words using the proxy pattern a class represents the functionality of another class wikipedia says a proxy in its most general form is a class functioning as an interface to something else a proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object or can provide additional logic in the proxy extra functionality can be provided for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked programmatic example taking our security door example from above firstly we have the door interface and an implementation of door php interface door public function open public function close class labdoor implements door public function open echo opening lab door public function close echo closing the lab door then we have a proxy to secure any doors that we wantphp class secureddoor protected door public function construct door door this door door public function open password if this authenticate password this door open else echo big no it aint possible public function authenticate password return password ecr t public function close this door close and here is how it can be usedphp door new secureddoor new labdoor door open invalid big no it aint possible door open ecr t opening lab door door close closing lab door yet another example would be some sort of data mapper implementation for example i recently made an odm object data mapper for mongodb using this pattern where i wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method call all the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case offindorfindonedata was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead ofcursor behavioral design patterns in plain words it is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects what makes them different from structural patterns is they dont just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing communication between them or in other words they assist in answering how to run a behavior in software component wikipedia says in software engineering behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns by doing so these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication chain of responsibility command iterator mediator memento observer visitor strategy state template method üîó chain of responsibility real world example for example you have three payment methods a b and c setup in your account each having a different amount in it a has 100 usd b has 300 usd and c having 1000 usd and the preference for payments is chosen as a then b then c you try to purchase something that is worth 210 usd using chain of responsibility first of all account a will be checked if it can make the purchase if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken if not request will move forward to account b checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler here a b and c are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is chain of responsibility in plain words it helps building a chain of objects request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler wikipedia says in object oriented design the chain of responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain programmatic example translating our account example above first of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts php abstract class account protected successor protected balance public function setnext account account this successor account public function pay float amounttopay if this canpay amounttopay echo sprintf paid s using s php eol amounttopay get called class elseif this successor echo sprintf cannot pay using s proceeding php eol get called class this successor pay amounttopay else throw new exception none of the accounts have enough balance public function canpay amount bool return this balance amount class bank extends account protected balance public function construct float balance this balance balance class paypal extends account protected balance public function construct float balance this balance balance class bitcoin extends account protected balance public function construct float balance this balance balance now lets prepare the chain using the links defined above i e bank paypal bitcoin php lets prepare a chain like below bank paypal bitcoin first priority bank if bank cant pay then paypal if paypal cant pay then bit coin bank new bank 100 bank with balance 100 paypal new paypal 200 paypal with balance 200 bitcoin new bitcoin 300 bitcoin with balance 300 bank setnext paypal paypal setnext bitcoin lets try to pay using the first priority i e bank bank pay 259 output will be cannot pay using bank proceeding cannot pay using paypal proceeding paid 259 using bitcoin üëÆ command real world example a generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant you i e client ask the waiter i e invoker to bring some food i e command and waiter simply forwards the request to chef i e receiver who has the knowledge of what and how to cook another example would be you i e client switching on i e command the television i e receiver using a remote control invoker in plain words allows you to encapsulate actions in objects the key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver wikipedia says in object oriented programming the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time this information includes the method name the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters programmatic example first of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action that could be performed php receiver class bulb public function turnon echo bulb has been lit public function turnoff echo darkness then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and then we have a set of commandsphp interface command public function execute public function undo public function redo command class turnon implements command protected bulb public function construct bulb bulb this bulb bulb public function execute this bulb turnon public function undo this bulb turnoff public function redo this execute class turnoff implements command protected bulb public function construct bulb bulb this bulb bulb public function execute this bulb turnoff public function undo this bulb turnon public function redo this execute then we have an invoker with whom the client will interact to process any commandsphp invoker class remotecontrol public function submit command command command execute finally lets see how we can use it in our clientphp bulb new bulb turnon new turnon bulb turnoff new turnoff bulb remote new remotecontrol remote submit turnon bulb has been lit remote submit turnoff darkness command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them if the final command is successfully executed all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the undo on all the executed commands ‚ûø iterator real world example an old radio set will be a good example of iterator where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels or take an example of mp3 player or a tv set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels songs or radio stations in plain words it presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation wikipedia says in object oriented programming the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the containers elements the iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers in some cases algorithms are necessarily container specific and thus cannot be decoupled programmatic example in php it is quite easy to implement using spl standard php library translating our radio stations example from above first of all we have radiostation php class radiostation protected frequency public function construct float frequency this frequency frequency public function getfrequency float return this frequency then we have our iterator php use countable use iterator class stationlist implements countable iterator var radiostation stations protected stations var int counter protected counter public function addstation radiostation station this stations station public function removestation radiostation toremove toremovefrequency toremove getfrequency this stations array filter this stations function radiostation station use toremovefrequency return station getfrequency toremovefrequency public function count int return count this stations public function current radiostation return this stations this counter public function key return this counter public function next this counter public function rewind this counter 0 public function valid bool return isset this stations this counter and then it can be used asphp stationlist new stationlist stationlist addstation new radiostation 89 stationlist addstation new radiostation 101 stationlist addstation new radiostation 102 stationlist addstation new radiostation 103 2 foreach stationlist as station echo station getfrequency php eol stationlist removestation new radiostation 89 will remove station 89 üëΩ mediator real world example a general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent in this case network provider is mediator in plain words mediator pattern adds a third party object called mediator to control the interaction between two objects called colleagues it helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other because now they dont need to have the knowledge of each others implementation wikipedia says in software engineering the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact this pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the programs running behavior programmatic example here is the simplest example of a chat room i e mediator with users i e colleagues sending messages to each other first of all we have the mediator i e the chat room php interface chatroommediator public function showmessage user user string message mediator class chatroom implements chatroommediator public function showmessage user user string message time date m d y h i sender user getname echo time sender message then we have our users i e colleagues php class user protected name protected chatmediator public function construct string name chatroommediator chatmediator this name name this chatmediator chatmediator public function getname return this name public function send message this chatmediator showmessage this message and the usagephp mediator new chatroom john new user john doe mediator jane new user jane doe mediator john send hi there jane send hey output will be feb 14 10 58 john hi there feb 14 10 58 jane hey üíæ memento real world example take the example of calculator i e originator where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory i e memento so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons i e caretaker in plain words memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner wikipedia says the memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state undo via rollback usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality programmatic example lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want first of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state php class editormemento protected content public function construct string content this content content public function getcontent return this content then we have our editor i e originator that is going to use memento object php class editor protected content public function type string words this content this content words public function getcontent return this content public function save return new editormemento this content public function restore editormemento memento this content memento getcontent and then it can be used as php editor new editor type some stuff editor type this is the first sentence editor type this is second save the state to restore to this is the first sentence this is second saved editor save type some more editor type and this is third output content before saving echo editor getcontent this is the first sentence this is second and this is third restoring to last saved state editor restore saved editor getcontent this is the first sentence this is second üòé observer real world example a good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job opportunity in plain words defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state all its dependents are notified wikipedia says the observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object called the subject maintains a list of its dependents called observers and notifies them automatically of any state changes usually by calling one of their methods programmatic example translating our example from above first of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting php class jobpost protected title public function construct string title this title title public function gettitle return this title class jobseeker implements observer protected name public function construct string name this name name public function onjobposted jobpost job do something with the job posting echo hi this name new job posted job gettitle then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribephp class employmentagency implements observable protected observers protected function notify jobpost jobposting foreach this observers as observer observer onjobposted jobposting public function attach observer observer this observers observer public function addjob jobpost jobposting this notify jobposting then it can

own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here just let them know of a place and they can visit it visitor pattern lets you do just that it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork in plain words visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them wikipedia says in object oriented programming and software engineering the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates a practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures it is one way to follow the open closed principle programmatic example lets take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them sound lets translate this using visitor pattern php visitee interface animal public function accept animaloperation operation visitor interface animaloperation public function visitmonkey monkey monkey public function visitlion lion lion public function visitdolphin dolphin dolphin then we have our implementations for the animalsphp class monkey implements animal public function shout echo ooh oo aa aa public function accept animaloperation operation operation visitmonkey this class lion implements animal public function roar echo roaaar public function accept animaloperation operation operation visitlion this class dolphin implements animal public function speak echo tuut tuttu tuutt public function accept animaloperation operation operation visitdolphin this lets implement our visitorphp class speak implements animaloperation public function visitmonkey monkey monkey monkey shout public function visitlion lion lion lion roar public function visitdolphin dolphin dolphin dolphin speak and then it can be used as php monkey new monkey lion new lion dolphin new dolphin speak new speak monkey accept speak ooh oo aa aa lion accept speak roaaar dolphin accept speak tuut tutt tuutt we could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals but now we will not have to change them for example lets say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i e php class jump implements animaloperation public function visitmonkey monkey monkey echo jumped 20 feet high on to the tree public function visitlion lion lion echo jumped 7 feet back on the ground public function visitdolphin dolphin dolphin echo walked on water a little and disappeared and for the usagephp jump new jump monkey accept speak ooh oo aa aa monkey accept jump jumped 20 feet high on to the tree lion accept speak roaaar lion accept jump jumped 7 feet back on the ground dolphin accept speak tuut tutt tuutt dolphin accept jump walked on water a little and disappeared üí° strategy real world example consider the example of sorting we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow in order to tackle this we implemented quick sort but now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets it was very slow for smaller datasets in order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets bubble sort will be used and for larger quick sort in plain words strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation wikipedia says in computer programming the strategy pattern also known as the policy pattern is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithms behavior to be selected at runtime programmatic example translating our example from above first of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations php interface sortstrategy public function sort array dataset array class bubblesortstrategy implements sortstrategy public function sort array dataset array echo sorting using bubble sort do sorting return dataset class quicksortstrategy implements sortstrategy public function sort array dataset array echo sorting using quick sort do sorting return dataset and then we have our client that is going to use any strategy php class sorter protected sorter public function construct sortstrategy sorter this sorter sorter public function sort array dataset array return this sorter sort dataset and it can be used asphp dataset 1 5 4 3 2 8 sorter new sorter new bubblesortstrategy sorter sort dataset output sorting using bubble sort sorter new sorter new quicksortstrategy sorter sort dataset output sorting using quick sort üí¢ state real world example imagine you are using some drawing application you choose the paint brush to draw now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i e if you have chosen red color it will draw in red if blue then it will be in blue etc in plain words it lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes wikipedia says the state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object oriented way with the state pattern a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the patterns superclass the state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the patterns interface programmatic example lets take an example of text editor it lets you change the state of text that is typed i e if you have selected bold it starts writing in bold if italic then in italics etc first of all we have our state interface and some state implementations php interface writingstate public function write string words class uppercase implements writingstate public function write string words echo strtoupper words class lowercase implements writingstate public function write string words echo strtolower words class defaulttext implements writingstate public function write string words echo words then we have our editorphp class texteditor protected state public function construct writingstate state this state state public function setstate writingstate state this state state public function type string words this state write words and then it can be used asphp editor new texteditor new defaulttext editor type first line editor setstate new uppercase editor type second line editor type third line editor setstate new lowercase editor type fourth line editor type fifth line output first line second line third line fourth line fifth line üìí template method real world example suppose we are getting some house built the steps for building might look like prepare the base of house build the walls add roof add other floors the order of these steps could never be changed i e you cant build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone in plain words template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes wikipedia says in software engineering the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation deferring some steps to subclasses it lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithms structure programmatic example imagine we have a build tool that helps us test lint build generate build reports i e code coverage reports linting report etc and deploy our app on the test server first of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm php abstract class builder template method final public function build this test this lint this assemble this deploy abstract public function test abstract public function lint abstract public function assemble abstract public function deploy then we can have our implementations php class androidbuilder extends builder public function test echo running android tests public function lint echo linting the android code public function assemble echo assembling the android build public function deploy echo deploying android build to server class iosbuilder extends builder public function test echo running ios tests public function lint echo linting the ios code public function assemble echo assembling the ios build public function deploy echo deploying ios build to server and then it can be used as php androidbuilder new androidbuilder androidbuilder build output running android tests linting the android code assembling the android build deploying android build to server iosbuilder new iosbuilder iosbuilder build output running ios tests linting the ios code assembling the ios build deploying ios build to server üö¶ wrap up folks and that about wraps it up i will continue to improve this so you might want to watch star this repository to revisit also i have plans on writing the same about the architectural patterns stay tuned for it üë¨ contribution report issues open pull request with improvements
