locust links website locust io documentation docs locust io support questions slack signup description locust is an easy to use distributed user load testing tool it is intended for load testing web sites or other systems and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle the idea is that during a test a swarm of locusts will attack your website the behavior of each locust or test user if you will is defined by you and the swarming process is monitored from a web ui in real time this will help you battle test and identify bottlenecks in your code before letting real users in locust is completely event based and therefore its possible to support thousands of concurrent users on a single machine in contrast to many other event based apps it doesnt use callbacks instead it uses light weight processes through gevent each locust swarming your site is actually running inside its own process or greenlet to be correct this allows you to write very expressive scenarios in python without complicating your code with callbacks features write user test scenarios in plain old python no need for clunky uis or bloated xml—just code as you normally would based on coroutines instead of callbacks your code looks and behaves like normal blocking python code distributed scalable supports hundreds of thousands of users locust supports running load tests distributed over multiple machines being event based even one locust node can handle thousands of users in a single process part of the reason behind this is that even if you simulate that many users not all are actively hitting your system often users are idle figuring out what to do next requests per second number of users online web based ui locust has a neat html js that shows all relevant test details in real time and since the ui is web based its cross platform and easily extendable can test any system even though locust is web oriented it can be used to test almost any system just write a client for what ever you wish to test and swarm it with locusts its super easy hackable locust is very small and very hackable and we intend to keep it that way all heavy lifting of evented i o and coroutines are delegated to gevent the brittleness of alternative testing tools was the reason we created locust documentation more info and documentation can be found at https docs locust io questions help for questions about how to use locust feel free to stop by the slack or ask questions on stack overflow tagged locust bug reporting or feature requests open a github issue and follow the template listed there authors carl byström cgbystrom on twitter jonatan heyman jonatanheyman on twitter joakim hamrén jahaaja hugo heyman hugoheyman license open source licensed under the mit license see license file for details supported python versions locust supports python 2 7 3 4 3 5 and 3 6
