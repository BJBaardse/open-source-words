scrcpy v1 2 this application provides display and control of android devices connected on usb or over tcp ip it does not require any root access it works on gnu linux windows and macos requirements the android part requires at least api 21 android 5 0 you need adb it is available in the android sdk platform tools or packaged in your distribution android adb tools on windows if you use the prebuilt application it is already included otherwise just download the platform tools and extract the following files to a directory accessible from your path adb exe adbwinapi dll adbwinusbapi dll make sure you enabled adb debugging on your device s the client requires ffmpeg and libsdl2 on windows they are included in the prebuilt application build and install system specific steps linux install the required packages from your package manager debian ubuntu bash runtime dependencies sudo apt install ffmpeg libsdl2 2 0 0 client build dependencies sudo apt install make gcc pkg config meson \ libavcodec dev libavformat dev libavutil dev \ libsdl2 dev server build dependencies sudo apt install openjdk 8 jdk fedora bash enable rpm fusion free sudo dnf install https download1 rpmfusion org free fedora rpmfusion free release rpm e fedora noarch rpm client build dependencies sudo dnf install sdl2 devel ffms2 devel meson gcc make server build dependencies sudo dnf install java arch linux two aur packages have been created by users scrcpy scrcpy prebuiltserver windows for windows for simplicity prebuilt archives with all the dependencies including adb are available scrcpy win32 v1 2 zip sha 256 a1fe1de67ec75dcf970ca5d97a04c26ff0f2d61871f2ef51b6f2f0bf666966b2 scrcpy win64 v1 2 zip sha 256 35ae3bcee51771e7c51b8a8be87aef2295c9f267606a7cf83ebb0a4d583ef536 instead you may want to build it manually cross compile from linux this is the preferred method and the way the release is built from debian install mingw bash sudo apt install mingw w64 mingw w64 tools you also need the jdk to build the server bash sudo apt install openjdk 8 jdk then generate the releases bash make f makefile crosswindows it will generate win32 and win64 releases into dist in msys2 from windows you need msys2 to build the project from an msys2 terminal install the required packages bash runtime dependencies pacman s mingw w64 x86 64 sdl2 \ mingw w64 x86 64 ffmpeg client build dependencies pacman s mingw w64 x86 64 make \ mingw w64 x86 64 gcc \ mingw w64 x86 64 pkg config \ mingw w64 x86 64 meson for a 32 bits version replace x86 64 by i686 bash runtime dependencies pacman s mingw w64 i686 sdl2 \ mingw w64 i686 ffmpeg client build dependencies pacman s mingw w64 i686 make \ mingw w64 i686 gcc \ mingw w64 i686 pkg config \ mingw w64 i686 meson java 7 is not available in msys2 so if you plan to build the server install it manually and make it available from the path bash export path java home bin path mac os the application is available in homebrew just install it bash brew install scrcpy instead you may want to build it manually install the packages bash runtime dependencies brew install sdl2 ffmpeg client build dependencies brew install pkg config meson additionally if you want to build the server install java 8 from caskroom and make it avaliable from the path bash brew tap caskroom versions brew cask install java8 export java home usr libexec java home version 1 8 export path java home bin path docker see pierlon scrcpy docker common steps install the android sdk android studio and set android home to its directory for example bash export android home android sdk clone the project bash git clone https github com genymobile scrcpy cd scrcpy then build bash meson x buildtype release strip db lto true cd x ninja you can test it from here bash ninja run or you can install it on the system bash sudo ninja install without sudo on windows this installs two files usr local bin scrcpy usr local share scrcpy scrcpy server jar just remove them to uninstall the application prebuilt server since the server binary that will be pushed to the android device does not depend on your system and architecture you may want to use the prebuilt binary instead scrcpy server v1 2 jar sha 256 cb39654ed2fda3d30ddff292806950ccc5c394375ea12b974f790c7f38f61f60 in that case the build does not require java or the android sdk download the prebuilt server somewhere and specify its path during the meson configuration bash meson x buildtype release strip db lto true \ dprebuilt server path to scrcpy server jar cd x ninja sudo ninja install run at runtime adb must be accessible from your path if everything is ok just plug an android device and execute bash scrcpy it accepts command line arguments listed by bash scrcpy help for example to decrease video bitrate to 2mbps default is 8mbps bash scrcpy b 2m to limit the video dimensions e g if the device is 2540×1440 but the host screen is smaller or cannot decode such a high definition bash scrcpy m 1024 if several devices are listed in adb devices you must specify the serial bash scrcpy s 0123456789abcdef to show physical touches while scrcpy is running bash scrcpy t to run without installing bash run x options where x is your build directory shortcuts action shortcut switch fullscreen mode ctrl f resize window to 1 1 pixel perfect ctrl g resize window to remove black borders
