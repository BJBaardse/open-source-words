can have different heights vertical lists or widths horizontal lists compatible with semantic table reordering table pattern compatible with react portal portal pattern custom drag handles you can drag a whole item by just a part of it a droppable list can be a scroll container without a scrollable parent or be the child of a scroll container that also does not have a scrollable parent independent nested lists a list can be a child of another list but you cannot drag items from the parent list into a child list server side rendering compatible plays well with nested interactive

libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within react most notable of these is the amazing react dnd it does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the wildly inconsistent html5 drag and drop feature react beautiful dnd is a higher level abstraction specifically built for vertical and horizontal lists within that subset of functionality react beautiful dnd offers a powerful natural and beautiful drag and drop experience however it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by react dnd so this library might not be for you depending on what your use case is driving philosophy physicality the core design idea of react beautiful dnd is physicality we want users to feel like they are moving physical objects around application 1 no instant movement it is a fairly standard drag and drop pattern for things to disappear and reappear in response to the users drag for a more natural drag we animate the movement of items as they need to move out of the way while dragging to more clearly show a drags effect we also animate the drop of an item so that it animates into its new home position at no point is an item instantly moved anywhere ‚Äî regardless of whether it is dragging or not application 2 knowing when to move it is quite common for drag and drop interactions to be based on the position that user started the drag from in react beautiful dnd a dragging items impact is based on its centre of gravity ‚Äî regardless of where a user grabs an item from a dragging items impact follows similar rules to a set of scales ‚öñÔ∏è here are some rules that are followed to allow for a natural drag experience even with items of flexible height a list is dragged over when the centre position of a dragging item goes over one of the boundaries of the list a resting drag item will move out of the way of a dragging item when the centre position of the dragging item goes over the edge of the resting item put another way once the centre position of an item a goes over the edge of another item b b moves out of the way application 3 no drop shadows drop shadows are useful in an environment where items and their destinations snap around however with react beautiful dnd it should be obvious where things will be dropping based on the movement of items this might be changed in the future but the experiment is to see how far we can get without any of these affordances application 4 maximise interactivity react beautiful dnd works really hard to avoid as many periods of non interactivity as possible the user should feel like they are in control of the interface and not waiting for an animation to finish before they can continue to interact with the interface however there is a balance that needs to be made between correctness and power in order to make everybodys lives more sane here are the only situations where some things are not interactive from when a user cancels a drag to when the drop animation completes on cancel there are lots of things moving back to where they should be if you grab an item in a location that is not its true home then the following drag will be incorrect starting a drag on an item that is animating its own drop for simplicity this is the case it is actually quite hard to grab something while it is animating home it could be coded around but it seems like an edge case that would add a lot of complexity keep in mind that these periods of inactivity may not always exist application 5 no drag axis locking for now the library does not support drag axis locking aka drag rails this is where the user is restricted to only dragging along one axis the current thinking is this breaks the physical metaphor we are going for and sends a message to the user that they are interacting with a piece of software rather than moving physical objects around it is possible to ensure that a user can only drop in a single list by using props type and isdropdisabled you can also do some visual treatment to the list ondragstart to show the user that this is the only place they can interact with application 6 natural cross list movement rather than using an index based approach for keyboard movement between lists react beautiful dnd performs cross list movement based on inertia gravity and collisions you can find out more about how this works by reading the blog natural keyboard movement between lists carefully designed animations with things moving a lot it would be easy for the user to become distracted by the animations or for them to get in the way we have tweaked the various animations to ensure the right balance of guidance performance and interactivity dropping when you drop a dragging item its movement is based on physics thanks react motion this results in the drop feeling more weighted and physical moving out of the way items that are moving out of the way of a dragging item do so with a css transition rather than physics this is to maximise performance by allowing the gpu to handle the movement the css animation curve has been designed to communicate getting out of the way how it is composed a warm up period to mimic a natural response time a small phase to quickly move out of the way a long tail so that people can read any text that is being animated in the second half of the animation animation curve used when moving out of the way caring about the interaction details focus management react beautiful dnd does not create any wrapper elements this means that it will not impact the usual tab flow of a document for example if you are wrapping an anchor tag then the user will tab to the anchor directly and not an element surrounding the anchor whatever element you wrap will be given a tab index to ensure that users can tab to the element to perform keyboard dragging auto scrolling when a user drags a draggable near the edge of a container we automatically scroll the container as we are able to in order make room for the draggable a container is either a droppable that is scrollable or has a scroll parent or the window mouse and touch keyboard it also works in multi list configurations with all input types mouse and touch keyboard for mouse and touch inputs üê≠üì± when the center of a draggable gets within a small distance from the edge of a container we start auto scrolling as the user gets closer to the edge of the container we increase the speed of the auto scroll this acceleration uses an easing function to exponentially increase the rate of acceleration the closer we move towards the edge we reach a maximum rate of acceleration a small distance from the true edge of a container so that the user does not need to be extremely precise to obtain the maximum scroll speed this logic applies for any edge that is scrollable the distances required for auto scrolling are based on a percentage of the height or width of the container for vertical and horizontal scrolling respectively by using percentages rather than raw pixel values we are able to have a great experience regardless of the size and shape of your containers mouse wheel and trackpads in addition to auto scrolling we also allow users to scroll the window or a droppable manually using their mouse wheel or trackpad üëå a note about big draggables if the draggable is bigger than a container on the axis you are trying to scroll we will not permit scrolling on that axis for example if you have a draggable that is longer than the height of the window we will not auto scroll vertically however we will still permit scrolling to occur horizontally ios auto scroll shake üì±ü§ï when auto scrolling on an ios browser webkit the draggable noticeably shakes this is due to a bug with webkit that has no known work around we tried for a long time to work around the issue if you are interesting in seeing this improved please engage with the webkit issue for keyboard dragging üéπ we also correctly update the scroll position as required when keyboard dragging in order to move a draggable into the correct position we can do a combination of a droppable scroll window scroll and manual movements to ensure the draggable ends up in the correct position in response to user movement instructions this is boss üî• this is amazing for users with visual impairments as they can correctly move items around in big lists without needing to use mouse positioning accessibility traditionally drag and drop interactions have been exclusively a mouse or touch interaction this library ships with support for drag and drop interactions using only a keyboard this enables power users to drive their experience entirely from the keyboard as well as opening up these experiences to users who would have been excluded previously we provide fantastic support for screen readers to assist users with visual or other impairments we ship with english messaging out of the box üì¶ however you are welcome to override these messages by using the announce function that it provided to all of the dragdropcontext hook functions see our screen reader guide for a guide on crafting useful screen reader messaging example screen reader behaviour mouse dragging sloppy clicks and click prevention üê±üéÅ when a user presses the mouse down on an element we cannot determine if the user was clicking or dragging also sometimes when a user clicks they can move the cursor slightly ‚Äî a sloppy click so we only start a drag once the user has moved beyond a certain distance with the mouse down the drag threshold ‚Äî more than they would if they were just making a sloppy click if the drag threshold is not exceeded then the user interaction behaves just like a regular click if the drag threshold is exceeded then the interaction will be classified as a drag and the standard click behaviour will not occur this allows consumers to wrap interactive elements such as an anchor and have it be both a standard anchor as well as a draggable item in a natural way üê±üéÅ is a schrodingers cat joke to see more indepth information about how we impact standard browser events see our how we use dom events guide keyboard shortcuts mouse dragging when a drag is not occurring react beautiful dnd does not impact any of the standard keyboard interactions it has no listeners bound when a drag is occurring with a mouse the user is able to execute the following keyboard shortcuts escape esc cancel the drag during a mouse drag the following standard keyboard events are prevented to prevent a bad experience tab tab ‚Üπ preventing tabbing enter ‚èé preventing submission other than these explicitly prevented keyboard events all standard keyboard events should work as expected keyboard dragging react beautiful dnd supports dragging with only a keyboard we have audited how our keyboard shortcuts interact with standard browser keyboard interactions when the user is not dragging they can use their keyboard as they normally would while dragging we override and disable certain browser shortcuts such as tab to ensure a fluid experience for the user to see more indepth information about how we impact standard browser events see our how we use dom events guide keyboard shortcuts keyboard dragging when a drag is not occurring the user will be able to navigate through the draggables on a page using the standard tab tab ‚Üπ key to move forward through the tabbable elements and shift tab shift tab ‚Üπ to move backwards we achieve this by adding a tab index to the draggable when a draggable has focus the spacebar space will lift a draggable this will start the drag once a drag is started the following keyboard shortcuts can be used spacebar space drop the draggable escape esc cancel the drag the following commands are also available but they depend on the type of droppable that the draggable is currently in within a vertical list up arrow ‚Üë move a draggable upwards in a droppable down arrow ‚Üì move a draggable downwards in a droppable right arrow ‚Üí move a draggable to a droppable to the right of the current droppable move to new list left

tab tab ‚Üπ preventing tabbing enter ‚èé preventing submission touch dragging react beautiful dnd supports dragging on touch devices such as mobiles and tablets recorded on iphone 6s understanding intention tap force press scroll and drag when a user presses their finger or other input on a draggable we are not sure if they where intending to tap force press scroll the container or drag as much as possible react beautiful dnd aims to ensure that a users default interaction experience remains unaffected to see more indepth information about how we impact standard browser events see our how we use dom events guide starting a drag long press a user can start a drag by holding their finger üëá on an element for a small period of time üïë long press tap support if the user lifts their finger before the timer is finished then we release the event to the browser for it to determine whether to perform the standard tap click action this allows you to have a draggable that is both clickable such as a anchor as well as draggable if the item was dragged then we block the tap action from occurring native scrolling support if we detect a touchmove before the long press timer expires we cancel the pending drag and allow the user to scroll normally this means that the user needs to be fairly intentional and precise with their grabbing once the first touchmove occurs we have to either opt in or out of native scrolling if the long press timer has not expired allow native scrolling and prevent dragging if the long press timer has expired a drag has started and we prevent native scrolling force press support safari only if the user force presses on the element before they have moved the element even if a drag has already started then the drag is cancelled and the standard force press action occurs for an anchor this is a website preview vibration this is merely an idea it is up to you to add this if you want this behavior if you like you could also trigger a vibration event when the user picks up a draggable this can provide tactile feedback that the user is doing something it currently is only supported in chrome on android js class app extends react component ondragstart good times if window navigator vibrate window navigator vibrate 100 multi drag we have created a multi drag pattern that you can build on top of react beautiful dnd in order to support dragging multiple draggable items at once preset styles we apply a number of non visible styles to facilitate the dragging experience we do this using combination of styling targets and techniques it is a goal of the library to provide unopinioned styling however we do apply some reasonable cursor styling on drag handles by default this is designed to make the library work as simply as possible out of the box if you want to use your own cursors you are more than welcome to all you need to do is override our cursor style rules by using a rule with higher specificity here are the styles that are applied at various points in the drag lifecycle in every phase always drag handle styles applied to drag handle element using the data react beautiful dnd drag handle attribute a long press on anchors usually pops a content menu that has options for the link such as open in new tab because long press is used to start a drag we need to opt out of this behavior css webkit touch callout none webkit based browsers add a grey overlay to anchors when they are active we remove this tap overlay as it is confusing for users more information css webkit tap highlight color rgba 0 0 0 0 avoid the pull to refresh action and delayed anchor focus on android chrome css touch action manipulation always droppable styles applied to droppable element using the data react beautiful dnd droppable attribute opting out of the browser feature which tries to maintain the scroll position when the dom changes above the fold we already correctly maintain the scroll position the automatic overflow anchor behavior leads to incorrect scroll positioning post drop css overflow anchor none phase resting phase resting drag handle styles applied to drag handle element using the data react beautiful dnd drag handle attribute adding a cursor style to let the user know this element is draggable you are welcome to override this css cursor grab phase dragging phase dragging drag handle element styles applied using the data react beautiful dnd drag handle attribute an optimisation to avoid processing pointer events while dragging also used to allow scrolling through a drag handle with a track pad or mouse wheel css pointer events none phase dragging draggable element styles applied using the data react beautiful dnd draggable attribute this is what we use to control draggables that need to move out of the way of a dragging draggable css transition string styles applied using inline styles this is described by the type draggablestyle phase dragging body element we apply a cursor while dragging to give user feedback that a drag is occurring you are welcome to override this a good point to do this is the ondragstart event css cursor grabbing to prevent the user selecting text as they drag apply this style css user select none phase dropping phase dropping drag handle element styles applied using the data react beautiful dnd drag handle attribute we apply the grab cursor to all drag handles except the drag handle for the dropping draggable at this point the user is able to drag other draggables if they like css cursor grab phase dropping draggable same as dragging phase phase user cancel when a user explicitly cancels a drag this is the same as phase dropping however we do not apply a cursor grab to the drag handle during a user initiated cancel we do not allow the dragging of other items until the drop animation is complete preset styles are vendor prefixed all styles applied are vendor prefixed correctly to meet the requirements of our supported browser matrix this is done by hand to avoid adding to react beautiful dnds size by including a css in js library installation package manager bash yarn yarn add react beautiful dnd npm npm install react beautiful dnd save distribution bundle a universal module definition bundle is published on npm under the dist folder for consumption we publish the following files dist react beautiful dnd js dist react beautiful dnd min js minified bundle these bundles list react as an external which needs to be provided this is done to reduce the size of the bundle and prevent consumers from loading react multiple times you can provide react through your module system or simply by having react on the window you can use the umd to run react beautiful dnd directly in the browser html peer dependency lib change x

use drag and drop you need to have the part of your react tree that you want to be able to use drag and drop in wrapped in a dragdropcontext it is advised to just wrap your entire application in a dragdropcontext having nested dragdropcontexts is not supported you will be able to achieve your desired conditional dragging and dropping using the props of droppable and draggable you can think of dragdropcontext as having a similar purpose to the react redux provider component props js type hooks optional ondragstart ondragstarthook ondragupdate ondragupdatehook always required ondragend

occurred this information can be helpful in crafting more useful messaging in the hookprovided announce function synchronous reordering because this library does not control your state it is up to you to synchronously reorder your lists based on the result dropresult here is what you need to do if the destination is null all done if source droppableid equals destination droppableid you need to remove the item from your list and insert it at the correct position if source droppableid does not equal destination droppableid then you need to remove the draggable from the source droppableid list and add it into the correct position of the destination droppableid list persisting a reorder if you need to persist a reorder to a remote data store update the list synchronously on the client and fire off a request in the background to persist the change if the remote save fails it is up to you how to communicate that to the user and update or not update the list best practices for hooks block updates during a drag it is highly recommended that while a user is dragging that you block any state updates that might impact the amount of draggables and droppables or their dimensions please listen to ondragstart and block updates to the draggables and droppables until you receive at ondragend when the user starts dragging we take a snapshot of all of the dimensions of the applicable draggable and droppable nodes if these change during a drag we will not know about it how do you block updates update blocking will look different depending on how you manage your data it is probably best to explain by example lets say you are using react component state to manage the state of your application your application state is tied to a rest endpoint that you poll every thirty seconds for data updates during a drag you should not apply any server updates that could effect what is visible this could mean stop your server poll during a drag ignore any results from server calls during a drag do not call this setstate in your component with the new data no update blocking can lead to bad times here are a few poor user experiences that can occur if you change things during a drag if you increase the amount of nodes then the library will not know about them and they will not be moved when the user would expect them to be if you decrease the amount of nodes then there might be gaps and unexpected movements in your lists if you change the dimensions of any node then it can cause the changed node as well as others to move at incorrect times if you remove the node that the user is dragging then the drag will instantly end if you change the dimension of the dragging node then other things will not move out of the way at the correct time ondragstart and ondragend pairing we try very hard to ensure that each ondragstart event is paired with a single ondragend event however there maybe a rogue situation where this is not the case if that occurs it is a bug currently there is no mechanism to tell the library to cancel a current drag externally droppable droppable components can be dropped on by a draggable they also contain draggables a draggable must be contained within a droppable js import droppable from react beautiful dnd provided snapshot i am a droppable provided placeholder droppable props droppableid a required droppableid string that uniquely identifies the droppable for the application please do not change this prop especially during a drag type an optional typeid string that can be used to simply accept a class of draggable for example if you use the type person then it will only allow draggables of type person to be dropped on itself draggables of type task would not be able to be dropped on a droppable with type person if no type is provided it will be set to default currently the type of the draggables within a droppable must be the same this restriction might be loosened in the future if there is a valid use case isdropdisabled an optional flag to control whether or not dropping is currently allowed on the droppable you can use this to implement your own conditional dropping logic it will default to false direction the direction in which items flow in this droppable options are vertical default and horizontal ignorecontainerclipping when a droppable is inside a scrollable container its area is constrained so that you can only drop on the part of the droppable that you can see setting this prop opts out of this behavior allowing you to drop anywhere on a droppable even if its visually hidden by a scrollable parent the default behavior is suitable for most cases so odds are youll never need to use this prop but it can be useful if youve got very long draggables inside a short scroll container keep in mind that it might cause some unexpected behavior if you have multiple droppables inside scroll containers on the same page children function the react children of a droppable must be a function that returns a

information on using innerref see our using innerref guide provided placeholder this is used to create space in the droppable as needed during a drag this space is needed when a user is dragging over a list that is not the home list please be sure to put the placeholder inside of the component for which you have provided the ref we need to increase the size of the droppable itself provided

backgroundcolor snapshot isdraggingover blue grey provided droppableprops i am a droppable provided placeholder div droppable conditionally dropping droppables can only be dropped on by draggables who share the same type this is a simple way of allowing conditional dropping if you do not provide a type for the droppable then it will only accept draggables which also have the default type draggables and droppables both will have their types set to default when none is provided there is currently no way to set multiple types or a type wildcard that will accept draggables of multiple any types this could be added if there is a valid use case using the isdropdisabled prop you can conditionally allow dropping this allows you to do arbitrarily complex conditional transitions this will only be considered if the type of the droppable matches the type of the currently dragging draggable you can disable dropping on a droppable altogether by always setting isdropdisabled to true you can do this to create a list that is never able to be dropped on but contains draggables technically you do not need to use type and do all of your conditional drop logic with the isdropdisabled function the type parameter is a convenient shortcut for a common use case scroll containers this library supports dragging within scroll containers dom elements that have overflow auto or overflow scroll the only supported use cases are the droppable can itself be a scroll container with no scrollable parents the droppable has one scrollable parent where a scrollable parent refers to a scroll container that is not the window itself empty droppables it is recommended that you put a min height on a vertical droppable or a min width on a horizontal droppable otherwise when the droppable is empty there may not be enough of a target for draggable being dragged with touch or mouse inputs to be over the droppable recommended droppable performance optimisation when a user drags over or stops dragging over a droppable we re render the droppable with an updated droppablestatesnapshot isdraggingover value this is useful for styling the droppable however by default this will cause a render of all of the children of the droppable which might be 100s of draggables this can result in a noticeable frame rate drop to avoid this problem we recommend that you create a component that is the child of a droppable whos responsibility it is to avoid rendering children if it is not required here is an example of how you could do this js import react component from react class student extends component student person render renders out a draggable student class innerlist extends component students person do not re render if the students list has not changed shouldcomponentupdate nextprops props if this props students nextprops students return false return true you could also not do your own shouldcomponentupdate check and just extend from react purecomponent render return this props students map student person class students extends component render return provided droppableprovided snapshot droppablestatesnapshot provided placeholder by using the approach you are able to make style changes to a droppable when it is being dragged over but you avoid re rendering all of the children unnecessarily keep in mind that if you are using react purecomponent that your component will not respond to changes in the context unfortunately we are unable to apply this optimisation for you it is a byproduct of using the function as child pattern draggable draggable components can be dragged around and dropped onto droppables a draggable must always be contained within a droppable it is possible to reorder a draggable within its home droppable or move to another droppable it is possible because a droppable is free to control what it allows to be dropped on it every draggable has a drag handle a drag handle is the element that the user interacts with in order to drag a draggable a drag handle can be a the draggable element itself or a child of the draggable js import draggable from react beautiful dnd provided snapshot my draggable note when the library moves to react 16 this will be cleaned up a little bit as we will be able to return the placeholder as a sibling to your child function without you needing to create a wrapping element draggable props draggableid a required draggableid string that uniquely identifies the draggable for the application please do not change this prop especially during a drag index a required number that matches the order of the draggable in the droppable it is simply the index of the draggable in the list the index needs to be unique within a droppable but does not need to be unique between droppables typically the index value will

contract of this library that it owns the positioning logic of the dragging element this includes properties such as top right bottom left and transform the library may change how it positions things and which properties it uses without performing a major version bump it is also recommended that you do not apply your own transition property to the dragging element warning position fixed react beautiful dnd uses position fixed to position the dragging element this is quite robust and allows for you to have position relative absolute fixed parents however unfortunately position fixed is impacted by transform such as transform rotate 10deg this means that if you have a transform on one of the parents of a draggable then the positioning logic will be incorrect while dragging lame for most consumers this will not be an issue to get around this you can use react portal we do not enable this functionality by default as it has performance problems we have a using a portal guide explaining the performance problem in more detail and how you can set up your own react portal if you want to focus retention when moving between lists when moving a draggable from one list to another the default browser behaviour is for the drag handle element to loose focus this is because the old element is being destroyed and a new one is being created the loss of focus is not good when dragging with a keyboard as the user is then unable to continue to interact with the element to improve this user experience we automatically give a drag handle focus when it was unmounted at the end of a drag it had focus it is enabled when mounted no other elements have gained browser focus before the drag handle has mounted extending draggableprops style if you are using inline styles you are welcome to extend the draggableprops style object you are also welcome to apply the draggableprops style object using inline styles and use your own styling solution for the component itself such as styled components if you are overriding inline styles be sure to do it after you spread the provided draggableprops or the spread will override your inline style js draggable draggable draggable 1

provided innerref provided draggableprops style style drag me div draggable avoid margin collapsing between draggables margin collapsing is one of those really hard parts of css for our purposes if you have one draggable with a margin bottom 10px and the next draggable has a margin top 12px these margins will collapse and the resulting margin will be the greater of the two 12px when we do our calculations we are currently not accounting for margin collapsing if you do want to have a margin on the siblings wrap them both in a div and apply the margin to the inner div so they are not direct siblings draggables should be visible siblings it is an assumption that draggables are visible siblings of one another there can be other elements in between but these elements should not take up any additional space you probably will not do this anyway but just calling it out to be super clear js direct siblings ‚úÖ not direct siblings but are visible siblings ‚úÖ spacer elements ‚ùå i will break things spacing on non sibling wrappers ‚ùå provided draghandleprops draghandleprops every draggable has a drag handle this is what is used to drag the whole draggable often this will be the same node as the draggable but sometimes it can be a child of the draggable draghandleprops need to be applied to the node that you want to be the drag handle this is a number of props that need to be applied to the draggable node the simplest approach is to spread the props onto the draggable node provided draghandleprops however you are also welcome to monkey patch these props if you also need to respond to them draghandleprops will be null when isdragdisabled is set to true draghandleprops type information js type draghandleprops onfocus void onblur void onmousedown event mouseevent void onkeydown

dragged or if it is drop animating both active dragging and the drop animation are considered part of the drag isdragging boolean set to true if a draggable is drop animating not every drag and drop interaction as a drop animation there is no drop animation when a draggable is already in its final position when dropped this is commonly the case when dragging with a keyboard isdropanimating boolean what droppable if any the draggable is currently over draggingover droppableid the children function is also provided with a small amount of state relating to the current drag state this can be optionally used to enhance your component a common use case is changing the appearance of a draggable while it is being dragged note if you want to change the cursor to something like grab you will need to add the style to the draggable see extending draggableprops style above js provided snapshot const style backgroundcolor snapshot isdragging blue grey provided draggableprops style return div ref provided innerref provided draggableprops provided draghandleprops style style drag me div draggable placeholder when dragging a draggable we leave behind a placeholder react element to maintain space in the droppable in order to prevent it from collapsing the placeholder mimics the styling and layout including width height margin tagname and display to ensure the list dimensions remain unaffected while dragging it will be inserted by react beautiful dnd as a direct sibling to the react node returned by the draggable children function adding an onclick handler to a draggable or a drag handle you are welcome to add your own onclick handler to a draggable or a drag handle which might be the same element onclick events handlers will always be called if a click occurred if we are preventing the click then we the event defaultprevented property will be set to true we prevent click events from occurring when the user was dragging an item see sloppy clicks and click prevention for more information interactive child elements within a draggable it is possible for your draggable to contain interactive elements by default we block dragging on these elements by doing this we allow those elements to function in the usual way here is the list of interactive elements that we block dragging from by default input button textarea select option optgroup video audio contenteditable any elements that are contenteditable or are within a contenteditable container you can opt out of this behavior by adding the disableinteractiveelementblocking prop to a draggable however it is questionable as to whether you should be doing so because it will render the interactive element unusable if you need to conditionally block dragging from interactive elements you can add the disableinteractiveelementblocking prop to opt out of the default blocking and monkey patch the draghandleprops draghandleprops event handlers to disable dragging as required resetservercontext the resetservercontext function should be used when server side rendering ssr it ensures context state does not persist across multiple renders on the server which would result in client server markup mismatches after multiple requests are rendered on the server use it before calling the server side render method js import resetservercontext from react beautiful dnd import rendertostring from react dom server resetservercontext rendertostring flow usage react beautiful dnd is typed using flowtype this greatly improves internal consistency within the codebase we also expose a number of public types which will allow you to type your javascript if you would like to if you are not using flowtype this will not inhibit you from using the library it is just extra safety for those who want it

using them is as simple as js import type droppableprovided from react beautiful dnd typescript if you are using typescript you can use the community maintained definitelytyped type definitions installation instructions sample application with flow types we have created a sample application which exercises the flowtypes it is a super simple react project based on react create app you can use this as a reference to see how to set things up correctly engineering health typed this codebase is typed with flowtype to promote greater internal consistency and more resilient code tested this code base employs a number of different testing strategies including unit performance and integration tests testing various aspects of the system helps to promote its quality and stability while code coverage is not a guarantee of code health it is a good indicator this code base currently sits at 90 coverage performance this codebase is designed to be extremely performant it is part of its dna it is designed to perform the smallest amount of updates possible you can have a read about performance work done for react beautiful dnd here rethinking drag and drop dragging react performance forward
