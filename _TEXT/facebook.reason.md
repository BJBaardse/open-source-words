reason simple fast type safe code that leverages the javascript ocaml ecosystems getting started community contributing documentations go to https github com reasonml reasonml github io to contribute to the reason documentation codebase see the src folders readme installation for programmatic usage if youre not using reason programmatically disregard this section and see the getting started guide above this is for using reasons refmt as a third party library javascript api we expose a refmt js for you to use on the web again for local development please use the native refmt that comes with the installation here its an order of magnitude faster than the js version dont use the js version unless you know what youre doing lets keep our ecosystem fast please aaaanyways to install refmt js npm install reason heres the api with pseudo type annotations parsere code string astandcomments parse reason code parserei code string astandcomments parse reason interface code printre data astandcomments string print reason code printrei data astandcomments string print reason interface code parseml code parsemli code printml data printmli data same as above but for the ocaml syntax the type string is self descriptive the type astandcomments returned by the parse functions is an opaque data structure you will only use it as input to the print functions for example js const refmt require reason convert the ocaml syntax to reason syntax const ast refmt parseml let f a 1 const result refmt printre ast console log result prints let f a 1 the parse functions potentially throw an error of this shape js message string location can be undefined location all 1 indexed startline number inclusive startlinestartchar number inclusive endline number inclusive endlineendchar number exclusive note refmt js requires the node module fs which of course isnt available on the web if using webpack to avoid the missing module error put node fs empty into webpack config js see https webpack js org configuration node other node core libraries for more information refmt js is minified for you through closure compiler with an accompanying refmt map the size is 2 3mb but dont get fooled it gzips down to just 345kb this way you can carry it around in your own blog and use it to create interactive refmt playground without worrying about imposing bandwidth overhead to your readers again keep our ecosystem fast and lean native api were spoiled with more apis on the native side to use reason from opam as a native library you have these functions so reason toolchain re implementation with comments reason toolchain re interface with comments reason toolchain re print interface with comments reason toolchain ml implementation with comments etc the ml parsing functions might throw syntaxerr error error the re parsing functions might throw this docs on location t here in addition to syntaxerr error error example usage ocaml let ast and comments lexing from string let f a 1 reason toolchain re implementation with comments convert reason back to ocaml syntax thatll show these reason users let ocaml syntax reason toolchain ml print implementation with comments format str formatter ast and comments format flush str formatter license see reason license in license txt works that are forked from other projects are under their original licenses credit the general structure of refmt repo was copied from whitequarks m17n project including parts of the readme that instruct how to use this with the opam toolchain thank you ocaml
