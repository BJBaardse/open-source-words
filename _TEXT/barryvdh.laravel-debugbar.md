laravel debugbar note for v3 debugbar is now enabled by requiring the package but still needs app debug true by default for laravel 5 5 please use the 2 4 branch this is a package to integrate php debug bar with laravel 5 it includes a serviceprovider to register the debugbar and attach it to the output you can publish assets and configure it through laravel it bootstraps some collectors to work with laravel and implements a couple custom datacollectors specific for laravel it is configured to display redirects and jquery ajax requests shown in a dropdown read the documentation for more configuration options note use the debugbar only in development it can slow the application down because it has to gather data so when experiencing slowness try disabling some of the collectors this package includes some custom collectors querycollector show all queries including binding timing routecollector show information about the current route viewcollector show the currently loaded views optionally display the shared data eventscollector show all events laravelcollector show the laravel version and environment disabled by default symfonyrequestcollector replaces the requestcollector with more information about the request response logscollector show the latest log entries from the storage logs disabled by default filescollector show the files that are included required by php disabled by default configcollector display the values from the config files disabled by default cachecollector display all cache events disabled by default bootstraps the following collectors for laravel logcollector show all log messages swiftmailcollector and swiftlogcollector for mail and the default collectors phpinfocollector messagescollector timedatacollector with booting and application timing memorycollector exceptionscollector it also provides a facade interface for easy logging messages exceptions and time installation require this package with composer it is recommended to only require the package for development shell composer require barryvdh laravel debugbar dev laravel 5 5 uses package auto discovery so doesnt require you to manually add the serviceprovider the debugbar will be enabled when app debug is true if you use a catch all fallback route make sure you load the debugbar serviceprovider before your own app serviceproviders laravel 5 5 if you dont use auto discovery add the serviceprovider to the providers array in config app php php barryvdh\debugbar\serviceprovider class if you want to use the facade to log messages add this to your facades in app php php debugbar barryvdh\debugbar\facade class the profiler is enabled by default if you have app debug true you can override that in the config debugbar enabled or by setting debugbar enabled in your env see more options in config debugbar php you can also set in your config if you want to include exclude the vendor files also fontawesome highlight js and jquery if you already use them in your site set it to false you can also only display the js or css vendors by setting it to js or css highlight js requires both css js so set to true for syntax highlighting copy the package config to your local config with the publish command shell php artisan vendor publish provider barryvdh\debugbar\serviceprovider lumen for lumen register a different provider in bootstrap app php php if env app debug app register barryvdh\debugbar\lumenserviceprovider class to change the configuration copy the file to your config folder and enable it php app configure debugbar usage you can now add messages using the facade when added using the psr 3 levels debug info notice warning error critical alert emergency php debugbar info object debugbar error error debugbar warning watch out… debugbar addmessage another message mylabel and start stop timing php debugbar startmeasure render time for rendering debugbar stopmeasure render debugbar addmeasure now laravel start microtime true debugbar measure my long operation function do something… or log exceptions php try throw new exception foobar catch exception e debugbar addthrowable e there are also helper functions available for the most common calls php all arguments will be dumped as a debug message debug var1 somestring intvalue object start measure render time for rendering stop measure render add measure now laravel start microtime true measure my long operation function do something… if you want you can add your own datacollectors through the container or the facade php debugbar addcollector new debugbar\datacollector\messagescollector my messages or via the app container debugbar app make debugbar debugbar addcollector new debugbar\datacollector\messagescollector my messages by default the debugbar is injected just before body if you want to inject the debugbar yourself set the config option inject to false and use the renderer yourself and follow http phpdebugbar com docs rendering html php renderer debugbar getjavascriptrenderer note not using the auto inject will disable the request information because that is added after the response you can add the default request datacollector in the config as alternative enabling disabling on run time you can enable or disable the debugbar during run time php \debugbar enable \debugbar disable nb once enabled the collectors are added and could produce extra overhead so if you want to use the debugbar in production disable in the config and only enable when needed twig integration laravel debugbar comes with two twig extensions these are tested with rcrowe twigbridge 0 6 x add the following extensions to your twigbridge config extensions php or register the extensions manually php barryvdh\debugbar\twig\extension\debug barryvdh\debugbar\twig\extension\dump barryvdh\debugbar\twig\extension\stopwatch the dump extension will replace the dump function to output variables using the dataformatter the debug extension adds a debug function which passes variables to the message collector instead of showing it directly in the template it dumps the arguments or when empty all context variables twig debug debug user categories the stopwatch extension adds a stopwatch tag similar to the one in symfony silex twigbridge twig stopwatch foo …some things that gets timed endstopwatch
