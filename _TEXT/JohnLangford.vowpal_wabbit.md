wabbit fast online learning code for windows look at readme windows txt prerequisite software these prerequisites are usually pre installed on many platforms however you may need to consult your favorite package manager yum apt macports brew to install missing software boost library with the boost program options library option enabled the zlib compression library headers in linux distros package zlib devel red hat centos or zlib1g dev ubuntu debian lsb release redhat centos redhat lsb core debian lsb release ubuntu youre all set osx not required gnu autotools autoconf automake libtool autoheader et al this is not a strict prereq on many systems notably ubuntu with libboost program options dev installed the provided makefile works fine optional git if you want to check out the latest version of vowpal wabbit work on the code or even contribute code to the main project getting the code you can download the latest version from here the very latest version is always available via github by invoking one of the following for the traditional ssh based git interaction git clone git github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit git you can also try the following ssh url git clone git github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit git for http based git interaction git clone https github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit git compiling you should be able to build the vowpal wabbit on most systems with make make test optional if that fails try autogen sh make make test optional make install note that autogen sh requires automake see the prerequisites above autogen shs command line arguments are passed directly to configure as if they were configure arguments and flags note that autogen sh will overwrite the supplied makefile including the makefiles in sub directories so keeping a copy of the makefiles may be a good idea before running autogen sh if your original makefiles were overwritten by autogen sh calling automake you may always get the originals back from git using git checkout makefile makefile be sure to read the wiki https github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit wiki for the tutorial command line options etc the cluster directory has its own documentation for cluster parallel use and the examples at the end of test runtests give some example flags c optimization the default c compiler optimization flags are very aggressive if you should run into a problem consider creating and running configure with the enable debug option e g configure enable debug or passing your own compiler flags via the optim flags make variable make optim flags o0 g ubuntu debian specific info on ubuntu debian mint and similar the following sequence should work for building the latest from github get libboost program options and zlib apt get install libboost program options dev zlib1g dev get the python libboost bindings python subdir optional apt get install libboost python dev get the vw source git clone git github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit git build cd vowpal wabbit make make test optional make install ubuntu advanced build options clang and static if you prefer building with clang instead of gcc much faster build and slighly faster executable install clang and change the make step slightly apt get install clang make cxx clang a statically linked vw executable that is not sensitive to boost version upgrades and can be safely copied between different linux versions e g even from ubuntu to red hat can be built and tested with make cxx clang static clean vw test ignore warnings debian python 3 binding ensure boost library and c compiler are installed apt get install libboost program options dev zlib1g dev libboost python dev clang make automake set python 3 x and its boost library as default update alternatives install usr bin python

is available via the brew or macports package managers complete brew install of 8 4 brew install vowpal wabbit the homebrew formula for vw is located on github manual install of vowpal wabbit osx dependencies if using brew brew install libtool brew install autoconf brew install automake brew install boost brew install boost python osx dependencies if using macports install glibtool and other gnu autotool friends port install libtool autoconf automake build boost for mac os x 10 8 and below port install boost no single no static openmpi python27 configure cxx stdlib libc configure cxx clang build boost for mac os x 10 9 and above port install boost no single no static openmpi python27 osx manual compile mac os x 10 8 and below configure cxx stdlib libc and configure cxx clang ensure that clang uses the correct c 11 functionality while building boost ordinarily clang relies on the older gnu g 4 2 series header files and stdc library libc is the clang replacement that provides newer c 11 functionality if these flags arent present you will likely encounter compilation errors when compiling vowpalwabbit cbify cc these error messages generally contain complaints about std to string and std unique ptr types missing to compile sh autogen sh enable libc make make test optional osx python binding installation with anaconda when using anaconda as the source for python the default boost libraries used in the makefile need to be adjusted below are the steps needed to install the python bindings for vw this should work for python 2 and 3 adjust the directories to match where anaconda is installed create anaconda environment with boost conda create name vw boost source activate vw git clone https github com johnlangford vowpal wabbit git cd vowpal wabbit edit makefile change boost include to use anaconda env dir anaconda envs vw include change boost library to use anaconda lib dir andaconda envs vw lib cd python python setup py install code documentation to browse the code more easily do make doc and then point your browser to doc html index html note that documentation generates class diagrams using graphviz for best results ensure that it is installed beforehand
