universal table of contents üëá what is it why do we need yet another links basic overview interpolation render props native rendering react native and other targets what is it ü§î a set of simple spring physics based primitives as in building blocks that should cover most of your ui related animation needs once plain css cant cope any longer forget easings durations timeouts and so on as you fluidly move data from one state to another this isnt meant to solve each and every problem but rather to give you tools flexible enough to confidently cast ideas into moving interfaces why do we need yet another üßê react spring is a cooked down fork of christopher chedeaus animated which is used in react native by default it is trying to bridge it with cheng lous react motion although both are similarily spring physics based they are still polar opposites declarative primitives interpolations performance react motion ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ùå animated ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚úÖ ‚úÖ react spring ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ react spring builds upon animateds foundation making it leaner and more flexible it inherits react motions declarative api and goes to great lengths to simplify it it has lots of useful primitives can interpolate mostly everything and last but not least can animate by committing directly to the dom instead of re rendering a component frame by frame for a more detailed explanation read why react needed yet another animation library links üîó examples and codesandboxes click for a combined example repository you can install as well as a collection of code sandboxes to toy around with online api overview if you ever plan to use this library this should be a must read it will go a little deeper into the primitives and how native rendering can make a large performance impact full api reference for annotated prop types good for finding out about all the obscure props that i dont want to bore you with but which might come in handy you never know basic overview üî≠ springs demo a spring will move data from one state to another it remembers the current state value changes are always fluid jsx import spring from react spring styles i will fade in mount unmount transitions demo transition watches elements as they mount and unmount it helps you to animate these changes jsx import transition from react spring item key from opacity 0 height 0 enter opacity 1 height 20 leave opacity 0 height 0 pointerevents none items map item styles item text 2 state and 1 state reveals demo given a single child instead of a list you can toggle between two components jsx import transition from react spring toggle componenta componentb if you need to toggle a single child that is also possible toggle component trails and staggered animations demo trail animates the first child of a list of elements the rest follow the spring of their previous sibling jsx import trail from react spring item key items map item styles item text keyframes demo keyframes allow you to chain compose and orchestrate animations by creating predefined slots the resulting primitive behaves like the primitive it stems from it can receive all generic properties like native or from etc you make it animate by passing the state props which receives the named slot jsx import keyframes config from react spring you can create keyframes for springs trails and transitions const container keyframes spring single props show to opacity 1 chained animations arrays showandhide to opacity 1 to opacity 0 functions with side effects wiggle async call await call to x 100 config config wobbly await delay 1000 await call to x 0 config config gentle styles hello parallax and page transitions demo parallax allows you to declaratively create page scroll based animations jsx import parallax parallaxlayer from react spring first page second page time duration based implementations and addons demo youll find varying implementations under dist addons for now theres a time based animation as well common easings and ioses harmonic oscillator spring all primitives understand the impl property which you can use to switch implementations jsx import timinganimation easing from react spring dist addons interpolation üéõ you can interpolate almost everything from numbers colors names rgb rgba hsl hsla paths as long as the number of points match otherwise use custom interpolation percentages units arrays and string patterns you can also set non animatable string values and even auto is valid jsx spring to scale toggle 1 2 start toggle abc rgb 10 20 30 end toggle seagreen rgba 0 0 0 0 5 stop toggle 0 50 rotate toggle 0deg 45deg shadow toggle 0 2px 2px 0px rgba 0 0 0 0 12 0 20px 20px 0px rgba 0 0 0 0 5 path toggle m20 380 l380 380 l380 380 z m20 20 l20 380 l380 380 z vector toggle 1 2 50 100 20 30 1 100 pointerevents toggle all none height toggle auto 0 render props ‚õë the api is driven by render props we offer both render and children as well as prop forwardwing unrecognized props will be spread over the receiving component you can use it like always all the above examples or in various patterns for instance higher order render props jsx const header children bold styles bold children children hello there native rendering üöÄ most libs animate by having react recalculate the component tree on every frame here it attempts to animate a component consisting of 300 sub components plowing through the frame budget and causing jank react spring with the native property renders the component only once from then on the animation will be applied directly to the dom in a requestanimationframe loop similar to how gsap and d3 do it jsx import spring animated from react spring styles i will fade in native rendering comes with a few caveats you should know about before using it more about that here try going native in all situations where you can the benefits are worth it react native and other targets üéí the default export points to react dom if you want to animate react native refer to dist native and dist universal for any other target each target defines platform specific constants colors units etc the universal target is the least specific in react native you can still use the native keyword for more performance create your own animated components by calling into the animated function jsx import spring animated from react spring dist native
