arduino arduino is an open source physical computing platform based on a simple i o board and a development environment that implements the processing wiring language arduino can be used to develop stand alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer e g flash processing and maxmsp the boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled the open source ide can be downloaded for free at https www arduino cc en main software for more information see the website at https www arduino cc or the forums at https forum arduino cc you can also follow arduino on twitter at https twitter com arduino or like arduino on facebook at https www facebook com official arduino to report a bug in the software or to request a simple enhancement go to https github com arduino arduino issues more complex requests and technical discussion should go on the arduino developers mailing list https groups google com a arduino cc forum forum developers if youre interested in modifying or extending the arduino software we strongly suggest discussing your ideas on the developers mailing list before starting to work on them that way you can coordinate with the arduino team and others giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release https groups google com a arduino cc forum forum developers installation detailed instructions for installation in popular operating systems for linux https www arduino cc en guide linux see also the arduino playground page https playground arduino cc learning linux for macos x https www arduino cc en guide macosx for windows https www arduino cc en guide windows credits arduino is an open source project supported by many the arduino team is composed of massimo banzi david cuartielles tom igoe and david a mellis arduino uses gnu avr gcc toolchain gcc arm embedded toolchain avr libc avrdude bossac openocd and code from processing and wiring icon and about image designed by todo
