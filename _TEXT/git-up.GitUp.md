gitup work quickly safely and without headaches the git interface youve been missing all your life has finally arrived git recently celebrated its 10 years anniversary but most engineers are still confused by its intricacy 3 of the top 5 questions of all time on stack overflow are git related since git turns even simple actions into mystifying commands “git add” to stage versus “git reset head” to unstage anyone its no surprise users waste time get frustrated distract the rest of their team for help or worse screw up their repo gitup is a bet to invent a new git interaction model that lets engineers of all levels work quickly safely and without headaches its unlike any other git client out there from the way its built it interacts directly with the git database on disk to the way it works you manipulate the repository graph instead of manipulating commits with gitup you get a truly efficient git client for mac a live and interactive repo graph edit reorder fixup merge commits… unlimited undo redo of almost all operations even rebases and merges time machine like snapshots for 1 click rollbacks to previous repo states features that dont even exist natively in git like a visual commit splitter or a unified reflog browser instant search across the entire repo including diff contents a ridiculously fast ui often faster than the command line gitup was created by swisspol in late 2014 as a bet to reinvent the way developers interact with git after several months of work it was made available in pre release early 2015 and reached the top of hacker news along with being featured by product hunt and daring fireball 30 000 lines of code later gitup reached 1 0 mid august 2015 and was released open source as a gift to the developer community getting started learn all about gitup and download the latest release from http gitup co read the docs and use github issues for support feedback releases notes are available at https github com git up gitup releases builds tagged with a v e g v1 2 3 are released on the stable channel while builds tagged with a b e g b1234 are only released on the continuous channel you can change the update channel used by gitup in the app preferences to build gitup yourself simply run the command git clone recursive https github com git up gitup git in terminal then open the gitup gitup xcodeproj xcode project and hit run important if you do not have an apple id with a developer account for code signing mac apps the build will fail with a code signing error simply delete the code signing identity build setting of the application target to work around the issue gitupkit gitup is built as a thin layer on top of a reusable generic git toolkit called gitupkit this means that you can use that same gitupkit framework to build your very own git ui gitupkit has a very different goal than objectivegit instead of offering extensive raw bindings to libgit2 gitupkit only uses a minimal subset of libgit2 and reimplements everything else on top of it it has its own rebase engine for instance this allows it to expose a very tight and consistent api that completely follows obj c conventions and hides away the libgit2 complexity and sometimes inconsistencies gitupkit adds on top of that a number of exclusive and powerful features from undo redo and time machine like snapshots to entire drop in ui components architecture the gitupkit source code is organized as 2 independent layers communicating only through the use of public apis base layer depends on foundation only and is compatible with os x and ios core wrapper around the required minimal functionality of libgit2 on top of which is then implemented all the git functionality required by gitup note that gitup uses a slightly customized fork of libgit2 extensions categories on the core classes to add convenience features implemented only using the public apis ui layer depends on appkit and is compatible with os x only interface low level view classes e g gigraphview to render the gitup map view utilities interface utility classes e g the base view controller class giviewcontroller components reusable single view view controllers e g gidiffcontentsviewcontroller to render a diff views high level reusable multi views view controllers e g giadvancedcommitviewcontroller to implement the entire gitup advanced commit view important if the preprocessor constant debug is defined to a non zero value when building gitupkit this is the default when building in debug configuration a number of extra consistency checks are enabled at run time as well as extra logging be aware that this overhead can significantly affect performance gitupkit api using the gitupkit api should be pretty straightforward since it is organized by functionality e g repository branches commits interface components etc and a best effort has been made to name functions clearly regarding the core apis the best way to learn them is to peruse the associated unit tests for instance see the branch tests for the branch api here is some sample code to get you started error handling is left as an exercise to the reader opening and browsing a

of code in appdelegate applicationdidfinishlaunching through gitupkit this basic app also gets for free unlimited undo redo unified and side by side diffs text selection and copy keyboard shortcuts etc this source code also demonstrates how to use some other gitupkit view controllers as well as building a customized one complete example 2 gitdiff gitdiff demonstrates how to create a view controller that displays a live updating diff between head and the workdir à la git diff head complete example 3 gity gity is a gitx clone built using gitupkit and less than 200 lines of code complete example 4 igit igit is a test ios app that simply uses gitupkit to clone a github repo and perform a commit contributing see contributing md credits swisspol concept and code wwayneee ui design jayeb
