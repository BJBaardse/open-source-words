estimator inspired by password crackers through pattern matching and conservative estimation it recognizes and weighs 30k common passwords common names and surnames according to us census data popular english words from wikipedia and us television and movies and other common patterns like dates repeats aaa sequences abcd keyboard patterns qwertyuiop and l33t speak consider using zxcvbn as an algorithmic alternative to password composition policy — it is more secure flexible and usable when sites require a minimal complexity score in place of annoying rules like passwords must contain three of lower upper numbers symbols more secure policies often fail both ways allowing weak passwords p ssword1 and disallowing strong passwords more flexible zxcvbn allows many password styles to flourish so long as it detects sufficient complexity — passphrases are rated highly given enough uncommon words keyboard patterns are ranked based on length and number of turns and capitalization adds more complexity when its unpredictable more usable zxcvbn is designed to power simple rule free interfaces that give instant feedback in addition to strength estimation zxcvbn includes minimal targeted verbal feedback that can help guide users towards less guessable passwords for further detail and motivation please refer to the usenix security 16 paper and presentation at dropbox we use

bundle js webpack mymodule js webpack bundle js but we recommend against bundling zxcvbn via tools like browserify and webpack for three reasons minified and gzipped zxcvbn is still several hundred kilobytes significantly grows bundle size most sites will only need zxcvbn on a few pages registration password reset most sites wont need zxcvbn immediately upon page load since zxcvbn is typically called in response to user events like filling in a password theres ample time to fetch zxcvbn js after initial html css js loads and renders see the performance section below for tips on loading zxcvbn stand alone tangentially if you want to build your own standalone consider tweaking the browserify pipeline used to generate dist zxcvbn js shell browserify debug standalone zxcvbn \ t coffeeify extension coffee \ t uglifyify \ src main coffee exorcist dist zxcvbn js map dist zxcvbn js debug adds an inline source map to the bundle exorcist pulls it out into dist zxcvbn js map standalone zxcvbn exports a global zxcvbn when commonjs amd isnt detected t coffeeify extension coffee compiles coffee to js before bundling this is convenient as it allows js modules to import from coffee modules and vice versa instead of this transform one could also compile everything to js first npm run prepublish and point browserify to lib instead of src t uglifyify minifies the bundle through uglifyjs maintaining proper source mapping manual installation download zxcvbn js add to your html html script type text javascript src path to zxcvbn js script usage try zxcvbn interactively to see these docs in action javascript zxcvbn password user inputs zxcvbn takes one required argument a password and returns a result object with several properties coffee result guesses estimated guesses needed to crack password result guesses log10 order of magnitude of result guesses result crack times seconds dictionary of back of the envelope crack time estimations in seconds based on a few scenarios online attack on a service that ratelimits password auth attempts online throttling 100 per hour online attack on a service that doesnt ratelimit or where an attacker has outsmarted ratelimiting online no throttling 10 per second offline attack assumes multiple attackers proper user unique salting and a slow hash function w moderate work factor such as bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2 offline slow hashing 1e4 per second offline attack with user unique salting but a fast hash function like sha 1 sha 256 or md5 a wide range of reasonable numbers anywhere from one billion one trillion guesses per second depending on number of cores and machines ballparking at 10b sec offline fast hashing 1e10 per second result crack times display same keys as result crack times seconds with friendlier display string values less than a second 3 hours centuries etc result score integer from 0 4 useful for implementing a strength bar 0 too guessable risky password guesses 10 3 1 very guessable protection from throttled online attacks guesses 10 6 2 somewhat guessable protection from unthrottled online attacks guesses 10 8 3 safely unguessable moderate protection from offline slow hash scenario guesses 10 10 4 very unguessable strong protection from offline slow hash scenario guesses 10 10 result feedback verbal feedback to help choose better passwords set when score 2 result feedback warning explains whats wrong eg this is a top 10 common password not always set sometimes an empty string result feedback suggestions a possibly empty list of suggestions to help choose a less guessable password eg add another word or two result sequence the list of patterns that zxcvbn based the guess calculation on result calc time how long it took zxcvbn to calculate an answer in milliseconds the optional user inputs argument is an array of strings that zxcvbn will treat as an extra dictionary this can be whatever list of strings you like but is meant for user inputs from other fields of the form like name and email that way a password that includes a users personal information can be heavily penalized this list is also good for site specific vocabulary — acme brick co might want to include acme brick acmebrick etc performance runtime latency zxcvbn operates below human perception of delay for most input 5 20ms for 25 char passwords on modern browsers cpus 100ms for passwords around 100 characters to bound runtime latency for really long passwords consider sending zxcvbn only the first 100 characters or so of user input script load latency zxcvbn js bundled and minified is about 400kb gzipped or 820kb uncompressed most of which is dictionaries consider these tips if youre noticing page load latency on your site make sure your server is configured to compress static assets for browsers that support it nginx tutorial apache iis tutorial then try one of these alternatives put your script src zxcvbn js tag at the end of your html just before the closing body tag this ensures your page loads and renders before the browser fetches and loads zxcvbn js the downside with this approach is zxcvbn becomes available later than had it been included in head — not an issue on most signup pages where users are filling out other fields first if youre using requirejs try loading zxcvbn js separately from your main bundle something to watch out for if zxcvbn js is required inside a keyboard handler waiting for user input the entire script might be loaded only after the user presses their first key creating nasty latency avoid this by calling your handler once upon page load independent of user input such that the requirejs call runs earlier use the html5 async script attribute downside doesnt work in ie7 9 or opera mini include an inline script in head that asynchronously loads zxcvbn js in the background advantage over 3 it works in older browsers javascript cross browser asynchronous script loading for zxcvbn adapted from http friendlybit com js
