lottie for web android ios and react native lottie is a mobile library for web and ios that parses adobe after effects animations exported as json with bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile for the first time designers can create and ship beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand they say a picture is worth 1 000 words so here are 13 000 view documentation faq help examples and more at airbnb io lottie plugin installation option 1 recommended download it from from aescripts aeplugins http aescripts com bodymovin option 2 or get it from the

or get it directly from the ae plugin clicking on get player demo see a basic implementation here examples see examples on codepen how it works heres a video tutorial explaining how to export a basic animation and load it in an html page after effects open your ae project and select the bodymovin extension on window extensions bodymovin a panel will open with a compositions tab listing all of your project compositions select the composition you want to export select a destination folder click render look for the exported json file if you had images or ai layers on your animation there will be an images folder with the exported files html get the lottie js file from the build player folder for the latest build include the js file on your html remember to gzip it for production html script src js lottie js type text javascript script you can call lottie loadanimation to start an animation it takes an object as a unique param with animationdata an object with the exported animation data path the relative path to the animation object animationdata and path are mutually exclusive loop true false number autoplay true false it will start playing as soon as it is ready name animation name for future reference renderer svg canvas html to set the renderer container the dom element on which to render the animation it returns the animation instance you can control with play pause setspeed etc js lottie loadanimation container element the dom element that will contain the animation renderer svg loop true autoplay true path data json the path to the animation json composition settings check this wiki page for an explanation for each setting https github com airbnb lottie web wiki composition settings usage animation instances have these main methods play stop pause setlocationhref href href usually pass as location href its useful when you experience mask issue in safari where your url does not have symbol setspeed speed speed 1 is normal speed gotoandstop value isframe value numeric value isframe defines if first argument is a time based value or a frame based default false gotoandplay value isframe value numeric value isframe defines if first argument is a time based value or a frame based default false setdirection direction direction 1 is forward 1 is reverse playsegments segments forceflag segments array can contain 2 numeric values that will be used as first and last frame of the animation or can contain a sequence of arrays each with 2 numeric values forceflag boolean if set to false it will wait until the current segment is complete if true it will update values immediately setsubframe usesubframes usesubframes if false it will respect the original ae fps if true it will update on every requestanimationframe with intermediate values default is true destroy getduration inframes inframes if true returns duration in frames if false in seconds additional methods updatetextdocumentdata updates a text layers data more info lottie has 8 global methods that will affect all animations lottie play with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie stop with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie setspeed first argument speed 1 is normal speed with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie setdirection first argument direction 1 is normal direction with 1 optional parameter name to target a specific animation lottie searchanimations looks for elements with class lottie or bodymovin lottie loadanimation explained above returns an animation instance to control individually lottie destroy to destroy and release resources the dom element will be emptied lottie registeranimation you can register an element directly with registeranimation it must have the data animation path attribute pointing at the data json url lottie setquality default high set high medium low or a number 1 to improve player performance in some animations as low as 2 wont show any difference events oncomplete onloopcomplete onenterframe onsegmentstart you can also use addeventlistener with the following events complete loopcomplete enterframe segmentstart config ready when initial config is done data ready when all parts of the animation have been loaded data failed when part of the animation can not be loaded loaded images when all image loads have either succeeded or errored domloaded when elements have been added to the dom destroy other loading options if you want to use an existing canvas to draw you can pass an extra object renderersettings with the following configuration js lottie loadanimation container element the dom element renderer svg loop true autoplay true animationdata animationdata the animation data renderersettings context canvascontext the canvas context scalemode noscale clearcanvas false progressiveload false boolean only svg renderer loads dom elements when needed might speed up initialization for large number of elements hideontransparent true boolean only svg renderer hides elements when opacity reaches 0 defaults to true classname some css class name doing this you will have to handle the canvas clearing after each frame another way to load animations is adding specific attributes to a dom element you have to include a div and set its class to lottie if you do it before page load it will automatically search for all tags with the class lottie or you can call lottie searchanimations after page load and it will search all elements with the class lottie add the data json to a folder relative to the html create a div that will contain the animation required a class called lottie a data animation path attribute with relative path to the data json optional a data anim loop attribute a data name attribute to specify a name to target play controls specifically example html div style width 1067px height 600px class lottie data animation path animation data anim loop true data name ninja div preview you can preview or take an svg snapshot of the animation to use as poster after you render your animation you can take a snapshot of any frame in the animation and save it to your disk i recommend to pass the svg through an svg optimizer like https jakearchibald github io svgomg and play around with their settings recommendations files if you have any images or ai layers that you havent converted to shapes i recommend that you convert them so they get exported as vectors right click each layer and do create shapes from vector layers they will be saved to an images folder relative to the destination json folder beware not to overwrite an existing folder on that same location performance this is real time rendering although it is pretty optimized it always helps if you keep your ae project to what is necessary more optimizations are on their way but try not to use huge shapes in ae only to mask a small part of it too many nodes will also affect performance help if you have any animations that dont work or want me to export them dont hesitate to write im really interested in seeing what kind of problems the plugin has my email is hernantorrisi gmail com ae feature support the script supports precomps shapes solids images null objects texts it supports masks and inverted masks maybe other modes will come but it has a huge performance hit it supports time remapping the script supports shapes rectangles ellipses and stars expressions check the wiki page for more info not supported image sequences videos and audio are not supported no negative layer stretching no idea why but stretching a layer messes with all the data development npm install or bower install first npm start notes if you want to modify the parser or the player there are some gulp commands that can simplify the task look at the great animations exported on codepen see examples on codepen gzipping the animation jsons and the player have a huge reduction on the filesize i recommend doing it if you use it for a project issues for missing mask in safari browser please anim setlocationhref locationhref before animation is generated it usually caused by usage of base tag in html see above for description of setlocationhref
