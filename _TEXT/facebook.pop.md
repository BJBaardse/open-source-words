pop is an extensible animation engine for ios tvos and os x in addition to basic static animations it supports spring and decay dynamic animations making it useful for building realistic physics based interactions the api allows quick integration with existing objective c or swift codebases and enables the animation of any property on any object its a mature and well tested framework that drives all the animations and transitions in paper installation pop is available on cocoapods just add the following to your project podfile ruby pod pop 1 0 bugs are first fixed in master and then made available via a designated release if you tend to live on the bleeding edge you can use pop from master with the following podfile entry ruby pod pop git https github com facebook pop git framework manual by adding the project to your project and adding pop embedded framework to the embedded binaries section on the general tab of your apps target you can set up pop in seconds this also enables import pop syntax with header modules note because of some awkward limitations with xcode embedded binaries must share the same name as the module and must have framework as an extension this means that youll see three pop frameworks when adding embedded binaries one for os x one for tvos and one for ios youll need to be sure to add the right one they appear identically in the list but note the list is populated in order of targets you can verify the correct one was chosen by checking the path next to the framework listed in the format configuration platform e g debug iphoneos note 2 this method does not currently play nicely with workspaces since targets can only depend on and embed products from other targets in the same project it only works when pop xcodeproj is added as a subproject to the current targets project otherwise youll need to manually set the build ordering in the scheme and copy in the product static library manual alternatively you can add the project to your workspace and adopt the provided configuration files or manually copy the files under the pop subdirectory into your project if installing manually ensure the c standard library is also linked by including lc to your project linker flags usage pop adopts the core animation explicit animation programming model use by including the following import objective c objective c import or if youre using the embedded framework objective c import pop swift swift import pop start stop update to start an animation add it to the object you wish to animate objective c objective c popspringanimation

referencing the key specified on start objective c objective c layer pop removeanimationforkey mykey swift swift layer pop removeanimation forkey mykey the key can also be used to query for the

animated types there are four concrete animation types spring decay basic and custom spring animations can be used to give objects a delightful bounce in this example we use a spring animation to

by creating a new instance of the class in this example we declare a custom volume property objective c objective c prop popanimatableproperty propertywithname com foo radio volume initializer

declaring custom properties see popanimatableproperty h debugging here are a few tips when debugging pop obeys the simulators toggle slow animations setting try enabling it to slow down animations and more easily observe interactions consider naming your animations this will allow you to more easily identify them when referencing them either via logging or in the debugger objective c objective c anim name springopen swift swift anim name springopen each animation comes with an associated tracer the tracer allows you to record all animation related events in a fast and efficient manner allowing you to query and analyze them after animation completion the below example starts the tracer and configures it to log all events on animation completion objective c objective c

popanimationtracer h for more details testing pop has extensive unit test coverage to install test dependencies navigate to the root pop directory and type sh pod install assuming cocoapods is installed this will include the necessary ocmock dependency to the unit test targets scenekit due to scenekit requiring ios 8 and os x 10 9 pops scenekit extensions arent provided out of box unfortunately weakly linked frameworks cannot be used due to issues mentioned in the xcode 6 1 release notes to remedy this you can easily opt in to use scenekit simply add this to the preprocessor
