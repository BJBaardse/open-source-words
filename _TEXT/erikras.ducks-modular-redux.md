ducks redux reducer bundles i find as i am building my redux app one piece of functionality at a time i keep needing to add actiontypes actions reducer tuples for each use case i have been keeping these in separate files and even separate folders however 95 of the time its only one reducer actions pair that ever needs their associated actions to me it makes more sense for these pieces to be bundled together in an isolated module that is self contained and can even be packaged easily into a library the proposal example see also common js example javascript widgets js actions const load my app widgets load const create my app widgets create const update my app widgets update const remove my app widgets remove reducer export default function reducer state action switch action type do reducer stuff default return state action creators export function loadwidgets return type load export function createwidget widget return type create widget export function updatewidget widget return type update widget export function removewidget widget return type remove widget side effects only as applicable e g thunks epics etc export function getwidget return dispatch get widget then widget dispatch updatewidget widget rules a module must export default a function called reducer must export its action creators as functions must have action types in the form npm module or app reducer action type may export its action types as upper snake case if an external reducer needs to listen for them or if it is a published reusable library these same guidelines are recommended for actiontype action reducer bundles that are shared as reusable redux libraries name java has jars and beans ruby has gems i suggest we call these reducer bundles ducks as in the last syllable of redux usage you can still do javascript import combinereducers from redux import as reducers from ducks index const rootreducer combinereducers reducers export default rootreducer you can still do javascript import as widgetactions from ducks widgets and it will only import the action creators ready to be passed to bindactioncreators actually itll also import default which will be the reducer function itll add an action creator named default that wont work if thats a problem for you you should enumerate each action creator when importing there will be some times when you want to export something other than an action creator thats okay too the rules dont say that you can only export action creators when that happens youll just have to enumerate the action creators that you want not a big deal javascript import loadwidgets createwidget updatewidget removewidget from ducks widgets bindactioncreators loadwidgets createwidget updatewidget removewidget dispatch example react redux universal hot example uses ducks see src redux modules todomvc using ducks battlecry generators there are configurable battlecry generators ready to be downloaded and help scaffolding ducks sh npm install g battlecry cry download erikras ducks modular redux cry init duck run cry help to check more info about the generators available implementation the migration to this code structure was painless and i foresee it reducing much future development misery although its completely feasable to implement it without any extra library there are some tools that might help you extensible duck implementation of the ducks proposal with this library you can create reusable and extensible ducks saga duck implementation of the ducks proposal in typescript with sagas in mind results in reusable and extensible ducks redux duck helper function to create redux modules using the ducks modular redux proposal modular redux thunk a ducks inspired package to help organize actions reducers and selectors together with built in redux thunk support for async actions molecular js set of utilities to ease the development of modular state management patterns with redux also known as ducks ducks reducer function to combine ducks object reducers into one reducer equivalent to combinereducers and function ducks middleware to combine ducks object middleware into one single middleware compatible with applymiddleware simple duck class based implementation of modules system inspired by ducks modular redux all oop benefits like inheritance and composition support combining of duck module classes and regular reducer functions using combinemodules function please submit any feedback via an issue or a tweet to erikras it will be much appreciated happy coding erik rasmussen translation 한국어 中文 türkçe photo credit to airwolfhound
