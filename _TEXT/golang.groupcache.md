groupcache summary groupcache is a caching and cache filling library intended as a replacement for memcached in many cases for api docs and examples see http godoc org github com golang groupcache comparison to memcached like memcached groupcache shards by key to select which peer is responsible for that key unlike memcached groupcache does not require running a separate set of servers thus massively reducing deployment configuration pain groupcache is a client library as well as a server it connects to its own peers comes with a cache filling mechanism whereas memcached just says sorry cache miss often resulting in a thundering herd of database or whatever loads from an unbounded number of clients which has resulted in several fun outages groupcache coordinates cache fills such that only one load in one process of an entire replicated set of processes populates the cache then multiplexes the loaded value to all callers does not support versioned values if key foo is value bar key foo must always be bar there are neither cache expiration times nor explicit cache evictions thus there is also no cas nor increment decrement this also means that groupcache supports automatic mirroring of super hot items to multiple processes this prevents memcached hot spotting where a machines cpu and or nic are overloaded by very popular keys values is currently only available for go its very unlikely that i bradfitz will port the code to any other language loading process in a nutshell a groupcache lookup of get foo looks like on machine 5 of a set of n machines running the same code is the value of foo in local memory because its super hot if so use it is the value of foo in local memory because peer 5 the current peer is the owner of it if so use it amongst all the peers in my set of n am i the owner of the key foo e g does it consistent hash to 5 if so load it if other callers come in via the same process or via rpc requests from peers they block waiting for the load to finish and get the same answer if not rpc to the peer thats the owner and get the answer if the rpc fails just load it locally still with local dup suppression users groupcache is in production use by dl google com its original user parts of blogger parts of google code parts of google fiber parts of google production monitoring systems etc presentations see http talks golang org 2013 oscon dl slide help use the golang nuts mailing list for any discussion or questions
