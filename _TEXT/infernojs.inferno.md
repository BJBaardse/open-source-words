inferno is an insanely fast react like library for building high performance user interfaces on both the client and server description the main objective of the inferno project is to provide the fastest possible runtime performance for web applications inferno excels at rendering real time data views or large dom trees the performance is achieved through multiple optimizations for example infernos own jsx plugin creates monomorphic createvnode calls instead of createelement infernos diff process uses bitwise flags to memoize the shape of objects child nodes are normalized only when needed special jsx flags can be used during compile time to optimize runtime performance at application level many micro optimizations features component driven one way data flow architecture react like api concepts and component lifecycle events partial synthetic event system normalizing events for better cross browser support infernos linkevent feature removes the need to use arrow functions or binding event callbacks isomorphic rendering on both client and server with inferno server unlike react and preact inferno has lifecycle events on functional components unlike preact and other react like libraries inferno has controlled components for input select textarea elements components can be rendered outside their current html hierarchy using createportal api support for older browsers without any polyfills defaulthooks for functional components this way re defining lifecycle events per usage can be avoided browser support since version 4 we have started running our test suite without any polyfills inferno is now part of saucelabs open source program and we use their service for executing the tests infernojs natively supports the browsers listed below migration to v4 list of breaking changes can be found from here benchmarks ui bench dbmonster js web frameworks benchmark round 6 isomorphic ui benchmark 1k components code example lets start with some code as you can see inferno intentionally keeps the same design ideas as react regarding components one way data flow and separation of concerns in these examples jsx is used via the inferno jsx babel plugin to provide a simple way to express inferno virtual dom you do not need to use jsx its completely optional you can use hyperscript or createelement like react does keep in mind that compile time optimizations are available only for jsx jsx import render from inferno const message hello world render document getelementbyid app furthermore inferno also uses es6 components like react jsx import render component from inferno class mycomponent extends component constructor props super props this state counter 0 render return header counter is at this state counter render document getelementbyid app because performance is an important aspect of this library we want to show you how to optimize your application even further in the example below we optimize diffing process by using jsx hasvnodechildren to predefine children shape compile time then we create text vnode using createtextvnode all child flags are documented here jsx import createtextvnode render component from inferno class mycomponent extends component constructor props super props this state counter 0 render return header createtextvnode counter is at this state counter render document getelementbyid app tear down to tear down inferno application you need to render null on root element rendering null will trigger unmount lifecycle hooks for whole vdom tree and remove global event listeners it is important to unmount unused vnode trees to free browser memory jsx import createtextvnode render component from inferno const rootelement document getelementbyid app start the application render rootelement tear down render null rootelement more examples if you have built something using inferno you can add them here simple clock jsfiddle getting started the best way to get started with inferno is by using create inferno app alternatively you can try any of the following the inferno boilerplate for a very simple setup for a more advanced example demonstrating how inferno might be used we recommend trying out inferno starter project by nightwolfz for using inferno to build a mobile app try inferno mobile starter project by rudy zidan for typescript support and bundling with

sure you read more about inferno compat before using it third party state libraries inferno now has bindings available for some of the major state management libraries out there redux via inferno redux mobx via inferno mobx cerebral via cerebral view inferno jsx inferno has its own jsx babel plugin differences from react inferno is much smaller in size 8kb vs 45kb gzip this means inferno is faster to transfer over the network but more importantly it is much faster to parse – this makes a big impact on mobile inferno is considerably faster than react this doesnt apply to benchmarks only but to real world applications that companies have converted to inferno from react as well ranging from 40 110 performance improvement with inferno 1 0 no other react like library gets close to this performance gain over react inferno doesnt have a fully synthetic event system like react does inferno has a partially synthetic event system instead opting to only delegate certain events such as onclick inferno doesnt support react native inferno was only designed for the browser server with the dom in mind inferno doesnt support string refs – although this can be enabled using inferno compat we dont recommend using them since they are the source of many memory leaks and performance issues in real world apps stick with function callback refs instead inferno includes render on the main core package rather than have an infernodom package like react does we used to do it that way but we found people simply didnt like it given we dont support native furthermore by not splitting them we improved performance and bundle sizes inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components this is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than es2015 classes inferno is able to use the react dev tools extensions for chrome firefox etc to provide the same level of debugging experience to the inferno user via inferno devtools differences from preact inferno is larger in size 8kb vs 3kb gzip this means that preact should parse faster than inferno – if only slightly inferno has a partial synthetic event system resulting in better performance via delegation of certain events inferno is much faster than preact in rendering updating and removing elements from the dom inferno diffs against virtual dom rather than the real dom except when loading from server side rendered content which means it can make drastic improvements unfortunately diffing against the real dom has a 30 40 overhead cost in operations inferno fully supports controlled components for input select textarea elements this prevents lots of edgecases where the virtual dom is not the source of truth it should always be preact pushes the source of truth to the dom itself inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components this is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than es2015 classes event system like react inferno also uses a light weight synthetic event system in certain places although both event systems differ massively infernos event system provides highly efficient delegation and an event helper called linkevent one major difference between inferno and react is that inferno does not rename events or change how they work by default inferno only specifies that events should be camel cased rather than lower case lower case events will bypass infernos event system in favour of using the native event system supplied by the browser for example when detecting changes on an input element in react youd use onchange with inferno youd use oninput instead the native dom event is oninput available synthetic events are onclick ondblclick onmousemove onmousedown onmouseup onsubmit onkeypress onkeydown onkeyup oninput onchange onfocusin onfocusout linkevent package inferno linkevent is a helper function that allows attachment of props state context or other data to events without needing to bind them or use arrow functions closures this is extremely useful when dealing with events in functional components below is an example jsx import linkevent from inferno function handleclick props event props validatevalue event target value function mycomponent props return this is an example of using it with es2015 classes jsx import linkevent component from inferno function handleclick instance event instance setstate data event target value class mycomponent extends component render return linkevent offers better performance than binding an event in a class constructor and using arrow functions so use it where possible controlled components in html form elements such as input textarea and select typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input in inferno mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components and only updated with setstate we can combine the two by making the inferno state be the single source of truth then the inferno component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input an input form element whose value is controlled by inferno in this way is called a controlled component inferno top level api render package inferno javascript import render from inferno render document getelementbyid app render a virtual node into the dom in the supplied container given the supplied virtual dom if the virtual node was previously rendered into the container this will perform an update on it and only mutate the dom as necessary to reflect the latest inferno virtual node warning if the container element is not empty before rendering the content of the container will be overwritten on the initial render createrenderer package inferno createrenderer creates an alternative render function with a signature matching that of the first argument passed to a reduce scan function this allows for easier integration with reactive programming libraries like rxjs and most javascript import createrenderer from inferno import scan map from most const renderer createrenderer note vnodes represents a stream of virtual dom node updates scan renderer document getelementbyid app vnodes see inferno most fp demo for an example of how to build an app architecture around this createelement package inferno create element creates an inferno vnode using a similar api to that found with reacts createelement javascript import component render

their first argument is the props passed through from their parent createvnode package inferno js import createvnode from inferno createvnode flags type classname children childflags props key ref createvnode is used to create html elements virtual node object typically createelement package inferno create element h package inferno hyperscript or jsx are used to create vnodes for inferno but under the hood they all use createvnode below is an example of createvnode usage javascript import vnodeflags childflags from inferno vnode flags import createvnode createtextvnode render from inferno const vnode createvnode vnodeflags htmlelement div example createtextvnode hello world childflags hasvnodechildren hello world render vnode container createvnode arguments explained flags number is a value from vnodeflags this is a numerical value that tells inferno what the vnode describes on the page type string is tagname for element for example div classname string is the class attribute it is separated from props because it is the most commonly used property children vnode vnode is one or array of vnodes to be added as children for this vnode childflags number is a value from childflags this tells inferno shape of the children so normalization process can be skipped props object is object containing all other properties fe onclick method data attribute hello community key string

vnode this package has same api as react cloneelement javascript import clonevnode from inferno clone vnode clonevnode vnode props children clone and return a new inferno vnode using a vnode as the starting point the resulting vnode will have the original vnodes props with the new props merged in shallowly new children will replace existing children key and ref from the original vnode will be preserved clonevnode is almost equivalent to jsx vnode type vnode props props children vnode type an example of using clonevnode javascript import clonevnode createvnode render from inferno import

container whose html contents were rendered by inferno server inferno will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup finddomnode package inferno compat this feature has been moved from inferno to inferno compat in v4 forward no options are needed anymore note we recommend using a ref callback on a component to find its instance rather than using finddomnode finddomnode cannot be used on functional components if a component has been mounted into the dom this returns the corresponding native browser dom element this method is useful for reading values out of the dom such as form field values and performing dom measurements in most cases you can attach a ref to the dom node and avoid using finddomnode at all when render returns null or false finddomnode returns null

please note class components es2015 classes from inferno do not support the same lifecycle events they have their own lifecycle events that work as methods on the class itself development vs production modes by default inferno will run in development mode development mode provides extra checks and better error messages at the cost of slower performance and larger code to parse when using inferno in a production environment it is highly recommended that you turn off development mode running inferno on node js ensure the environment variable process env node env is set to production building inferno for use in a browser when running inferno on the browser using webpack or rollup a replacement will need to occur during your build webpack use the following configuration in your webpack build for production build js plugins new webpack defineplugin process env node env json stringify production when you are building for development you may want to use inferno dev esm js dev module dist index dev esm js file that build version has extra level of validation for development purposes you can use it by adding following code to your webpack config js resolve when doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno alias inferno dirname node modules inferno dist index dev esm js rollup use the following configuration in your rollup build js const replace require rollup plugin replace js plugins replace process env node env json stringify production when you are building for development you may want to use inferno dev esm js dev module dist index dev esm js file that build version has extra level of validation for development purposes you can use it by adding following code to your rollup config js const alias require rollup plugin alias plugins when doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno alias inferno dirname node modules inferno dist index dev esm js custom namespaces inferno always wants to deliver great performance in order to do so it has to make intelligent assumptions about the state of the dom and the elements available to mutate custom namespaces conflict with this idea and change the schema of how different elements and attributes might work so inferno makes no attempt to support namespaces instead svg namespaces are automatically applied to elements and attributes based on their tag name community there is an inferno slack you can join via inferno slack herokuapp com contributors this project exists thanks to all the people who
