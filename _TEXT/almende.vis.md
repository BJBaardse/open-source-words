vis js vis js is a dynamic browser based visualization library the library is designed to be easy to use handle large amounts of dynamic data and enable manipulation of the data the library consists of the following components dataset and dataview a flexible key value based data set add update and remove items subscribe on changes in the data set a dataset can filter and order items and convert fields of items dataview a filtered and or formatted view on a dataset graph2d plot data on a timeline with lines or barcharts graph3d display data in a three dimensional graph network display a network force directed graph with nodes and edges timeline display different types of data on a timeline the vis js library was initially developed by almende b v badges install install via npm npm install vis install via bower bower install vis link via cdnjs http cdnjs com or download the library from the github project https github com almende vis git load to use a component include the javascript and css files of vis in your web page html doctype html html head script src webroot vis dist vis js script link href webroot vis dist vis css rel stylesheet type text css head body script type text javascript load a visualization script body html or load vis js using require js note that vis css must be loaded too js require config paths vis path to vis dist require vis function math load a visualization a timeline can be instantiated as js var timeline new vis timeline container data options where container is an html element data is an array with data or a dataset and options is an optional object with configuration options for the component example a basic example on loading a timeline is shown below more examples can be found in the examples directory of the project html doctype html timeline basic demo body html font family sans serif var container document getelementbyid visualization var data id 1 content item 1 start 2013 04 20 id 2 content item 2 start 2013 04 14

timeline container data options build to build the library from source clone the project from github git clone git github com almende vis git the source code uses the module style of node require and module exports to organize dependencies to install all dependencies and build the library run npm install in the root of the project cd vis npm install then the project can be build running npm run build to automatically rebuild on changes in the source files once can use npm run watch this will both build and minify the library on changes minifying is relatively slow so when only the non minified library is needed one can use the watch dev script instead npm run watch dev custom builds the folder dist contains bundled versions of vis js for direct use in the browser these bundles contain all the visualizations and include external dependencies such as hammer js and moment js the source code of vis js consists of commonjs modules which makes it possible to create custom bundles using tools like browserify or webpack this can be bundling just one visualization like the timeline or bundling vis js as part of your own browserified web application note that hammer js version 2 is required as of v4 prerequisites before you can do a build install node js and npm on your system https nodejs org install the following modules using npm browserify babelify and uglify js sudo npm install g browserify babelify uglify js download or clone the vis js project git clone https github com almende vis git install the dependencies of vis js by running npm install in the root of the project cd vis npm install examples of custom builds example 1 bundle only a single visualization type for example to create a bundle with just the timeline and dataset create an index file named custom js in the root of the project containing js exports dataset require lib dataset exports timeline require lib timeline timeline then create a custom bundle using browserify like browserify custom js t babelify presets es2015 o dist vis custom js s vis this will generate a custom bundle vis custom js which exposes the namespace vis containing only dataset and timeline the generated bundle can be minified using uglifyjs uglifyjs dist vis custom js o dist vis custom min js the custom bundle can now be loaded like html doctype html html head script src dist vis custom min js script link href dist vis min css rel stylesheet type text css head body body html example 2 exclude external libraries the default bundle vis js is standalone and includes external dependencies such as hammer js and moment js when these libraries are already loaded by the application vis js does not need to include these dependencies itself too to build a custom bundle of vis js excluding moment js and hammer js run browserify in the root of the project browserify index js t babelify presets es2015 o dist vis custom js s vis x moment x hammerjs this will generate a custom bundle vis custom js which exposes the namespace vis and has moment js and hammer js excluded the generated bundle can be minified with uglifyjs uglifyjs dist vis custom js o dist vis custom min js the custom bundle can now be loaded as html doctype html load external dependencies load vis js example 3 bundle vis js as part of your commonjs application when writing a web application with commonjs modules vis js can be packaged automatically into the application create a file app js containing js var moment require moment var dataset require vis lib dataset var timeline require vis lib timeline timeline var container document getelementbyid visualization var data new dataset id 1 content item 1 start moment 2013 04 20 id 2 content item 2 start moment 2013 04 14 id 3 content item 3 start moment 2013 04 18 id 4 content item 4 start moment 2013 04 16 end moment 2013 04 19 id 5 content item 5 start moment 2013 04 25 id 6 content item 6 start moment 2013 04 27 var options var timeline new timeline container data options the application can be bundled and minified browserify app js o dist app bundle js t babelify uglifyjs dist app bundle js o dist app bundle min js and loaded into a webpage html doctype html html head link href node modules vis dist vis min css rel stylesheet type text css head body div id visualization div script src dist app bundle min js script body html example 4 integrate vis js components directly in your webpack build you can integrate e g the timeline component directly in you webpack build therefor you can e g import the component files from root direcory starting with index js import dataset timeline from vis index timeline graph2d var container document getelementbyid visualization var data new dataset var timeline new timeline container data to get this to work youll need to add some babel loader setting to your webpack config js module module rules test node modules \\\ vis \\\ \ js loader babel loader query cachedirectory true presets babel preset es2015 map require resolve plugins transform es3 property literals 2452 transform es3 member expression literals 2566 transform runtime 2566 there is also an demo project showing the integration of vis js using webpack test to test the library install the project dependencies once npm install then run the tests npm run test license copyright c 2010 2017 almende b v and
