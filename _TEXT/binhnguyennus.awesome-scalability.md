high scalability high availability high stability high performance and high intelligence back end designs an updated and curated list of selected readings to illustrate best practices in building high scalability high availability high stability high performance and high intelligence back end systems concepts are explained in the articles of prominent engineers and credible references case studies are taken from battle tested systems that serve millions to billions of users if your back end went slow traffic light understand your problems scalability problem fast for a single user but slow under heavy load or performance problem slow for a single user by reviewing some design principles and checking how scalability and performance problems are solved at tech companies the section of intelligence are created for those who work with data and machine learning at big data and deep learning scale if your back end went down construction even if you lose all one day you can build all over again if you retain your calm thuan pham vietnamese refugee cto of uber technologies inc so keep calm and mind the availability and stability matters if you have an incomming system design interview ocean look at some interview notes and real world architectures with completed diagrams to get a comprehensive view before designing your system on whiteboard you can check some talks of engineers from tech giants to know how they build scale and optimize their systems there are some selected books for you most of them are free good luck four leaf clover if you are building your dream team ferris wheel the goal of scaling team is not growing team size but increasing team output and value you can find out how tech companies reach that goal in various aspects hiring management
