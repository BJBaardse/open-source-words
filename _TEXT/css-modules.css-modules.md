css modules a css module is a css file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default all urls url and imports are in module request format xxx and xxx means relative xxx and xxx yyy means in modules folder i e in node modules css modules compile to a low level interchange format called icss or interoperable css but are written like normal css files css style css classname color green when importing the css module from a js module it exports an object with all mappings from local names to global names js import styles from style css import classname from style css element innerhtml naming for local class names camelcase naming is recommended but not enforced this is recommended because the common alternative kebab casing may cause unexpected behavior when trying to access style class name as a dot notation you can still work around kebab case with bracket notation eg style class name but style classname is cleaner exceptions global switches to global scope for the current selector respective identifier global xxx respective keyframes global xxx declares the stuff in parenthesis in the global scope similarly local and local for local scope if the selector is switched into global mode global mode is also activated for the rules this allows us to make animation abc local example locala global global b global c local locald locale global d composition its possible to compose selectors css classname color green background red otherclassname composes classname color yellow there can be multiple composes rules but composes rules must be before other rules extending works only for local scoped selectors and only if the selector is a single class name when a class name composes another class name the css module exports both class names for the local class this can add up to multiple class names its possible to compose multiple classes with composes classnamea classnameb dependencies composing from other files its possible to compose class names from other css modules css otherclassname composes classname from style css note that when composing multiple classes from different files the order of appliance is undefined make sure to not define different values for the same property in multiple class names from different files when they are composed in a single class note that composing should not form a circular dependency elsewise its undefined whether properties of a rule override properties of a composed rule the module system may emit an error best if classes do a single thing and dependencies are hierarchic composing from global class names its possible to compose from global class names css otherclassname composes globalclassname from global usage with preprocessors preprocessors can make it easy to define a block global or local i e with less js less global global class name color green why modular and reusable css no more conflicts explicit dependencies no global scope examples css modules webpack demo outpunk postcss modules example theming css modules browserify demo x team starting css modules history 04 2015 placeholders feature in css loader webpack allows local scoped selectors later renamed to local scope by sokra 05 2015 postcss local scope enables local scope by default see blog post by markdalgleish 05 2015 extends feature in css loader allow to compose local or imported class names by sokra 05 2015 first css modules spec document and github organization with sokra markdalgleish and geelen 06 2015 extends renamed to composes 06 2015 postcss transformations to transform css modules into an intermediate format icss 06 2015 spec for icss as common implementation format for multiple module systems by geelen 06 2015 implementation for jspm by geelen and guybedford 06 2015 implementation for browserify by joshwnj joshgillies and markdalgleish 06 2015 webpacks css loader implementation updated to latest spec by sokra implementations webpack webpacks css loader in module mode replaces every local scoped identifier with a global unique name hashed from module name and local identifier by default and exports the used identifier extending adds the source class name s to the exports extending from other modules first imports the other module and then adds the class name s to the exports server side and static websites postcss modules allows to use css modules for static builds and the server side with ruby php or any other language or framework
