photoview photoview aims to help produce an easily usable implementation of a zooming android imageview dependency add this in your root build gradle file not your module build gradle file gradle allprojects repositories maven url https jitpack io then add the library to your module build gradle gradle dependencies implementation com github chrisbanes photoview latest release here features out of the box zooming using multi touch and double tap scrolling with smooth scrolling fling works perfectly when used in a scrolling parent such as viewpager allows the application to be notified when the displayed matrix has changed useful for when you need to update your ui based on the current zoom scroll position allows the application to be notified when the user taps on the photo usage there is a sample provided which shows how to use the library in a more advanced way but for completeness here is all that is required to get photoview working xml com github chrisbanes photoview photoview android id id photo view android layout width match parent android layout height match parent java photoview photoview photoview findviewbyid r id photo view photoview setimageresource r drawable image thats it issues with viewgroups there are some viewgroups ones that utilize onintercepttouchevent that throw exceptions when a photoview is placed within them most notably viewpager and drawerlayout this is a framework issue that has not been resolved in order to prevent this exception which typically occurs when you zoom out take a look at hackydrawerlayout and you can see the solution is to simply catch the exception any viewgroup which uses onintercepttouchevent will also need to be extended and exceptions caught use the hackydrawerlayout as a template of how to do so the basic implementation is java public class hackyproblematicviewgroup extends problematicviewgroup public hackyproblematicviewgroup context context super context override public boolean onintercepttouchevent motionevent ev try return super onintercepttouchevent ev catch illegalargumentexception e uncomment if you really want to see these errors e printstacktrace return false usage with fresco due to the complex nature of fresco this library does not currently support fresco see this project as an alternative solution subsampling support this library aims to keep the zooming implementation simple if you are looking for an implementation that supports subsampling check out this project license copyright 2017 chris banes licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
