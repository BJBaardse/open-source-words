this version of calligraphy has reached its end of life and is no longer maintained please migrate to calligraphy 3 calligraphy custom fonts in android an ok way are you fed up of custom views to set fonts or traversing the viewtree to find textviews yeah me too getting started dependency include the dependency download aar groovy dependencies compile uk co chrisjenx calligraphy 2 3 0 add fonts add your custom fonts to assets all font definitions are relative to this path assuming that you are using gradle you should create the assets directory under src main in your project directory if it does not already exist as its popular to use multi project build with gradle the path is usually app src main assets where app is the project name you might consider creating a fonts subdirectory in the assets directory as in examples usage xml textview fontpath fonts myfont ttf note the missing namespace this is intentional installation define your default font using calligraphyconfig in your application class in the oncreate method java override public void oncreate super oncreate calligraphyconfig initdefault new calligraphyconfig builder setdefaultfontpath fonts roboto robotoregular ttf setfontattrid r attr fontpath build note you dont need to define calligraphyconfig but the library will apply no default font and use the default attribute of r attr fontpath inject into context wrap the activity context java override protected void attachbasecontext context newbase super attachbasecontext calligraphycontextwrapper wrap newbase youre good to go usage custom font per textview xml textview android text string hello world android layout width wrap content android layout height wrap content fontpath fonts roboto bold ttf note popular ides android studio intellij will likely mark this as an error despite being correct you may want to add tools ignore missingprefix to either the view itself or its parent viewgroup to avoid this youll need to add the tools namespace to have access to this ignore attribute xmlns tools http schemas android com tools see https code google com p android issues detail id 65176 custom font in textappearance xml style name textappearance

resolution the calligraphyfactory looks for the font in a pretty specific order for the most part its very similar to how the android framework resolves attributes 1 view xml attr defined here will always take priority 2 style xml attr defined here is checked next 3 textappearance xml attr is checked next the only caveat to this is if you have a font defined in the style and a textattribute defined in the view the style attribute is picked first 4 theme if defined this is used 5 default if defined in the calligraphyconfig this is used of none of the above are found or if one of the above returns an invalid font why not piggyback off of fontfamily attribute we originally did but it conflicted with users wanting to actually use that attribute you now have to define a custom attribute why no jar we needed to ship a custom id with calligraphy to improve the font injection flow this unfortunately means that it has to be an aar but youre using gradle now anyway right multiple typefaces per textview spannables it is possible to use multiple typefaces inside a textview this isnt new concept to android this could be achieved using something like the following code java spannablestringbuilder sbuilder new spannablestringbuilder sbuilder append hello bold this append i use calligraphy default textview font create the typeface you want to apply to certain text calligraphytypefacespan typefacespan new calligraphytypefacespan typefaceutils load getassets fonts roboto bold ttf apply typeface to the spannable 0 6 hello this can of course by dynamic sbuilder setspan typefacespan 0 6 spanned span exclusive exclusive settext sbuilder textview buffertype spannable of course this is just an example your mileage may vary exceptions pitfalls to our knowledge try grep r e void set typeface there are two standard android widgets that have multiple methods to set typefaces they are android support v7 widget switchcompat android widget switch both have a method called setswitchtypeface that sets the typeface within the switch e g on off yes no settypeface sets the typeface of the label you will need to create your own subclass that overrides settypeface and calls both super settypeface and super setswitchtypeface collaborators mironov nsk https github com mironov nsk roman zhilich https github com romanzhilich smuldr https github com
