asciinema terminal session recorder and the best companion of asciinema org quick intro asciinema lets you easily record terminal sessions and replay them in a terminal as well as in a web browser install latest version other installation options sudo pip3 install asciinema record your first session asciinema rec first cast now replay it with double speed asciinema play s 2 first cast or with normal speed but with idle time limited to 2 seconds asciinema play i 2 first cast you can pass i 2 to asciinema rec as well to set it permanently on a recording idle time limiting makes the recordings much more interesting to watch try it if you want to watch and share it on the web upload it asciinema upload first cast the above uploads it to asciinema org which is a default asciinema server instance and prints a secret link you can use to watch your recording in a web browser you can record and upload in one step by omitting the filename asciinema rec youll be asked to confirm the upload when the recording is done so nothing is sent anywhere without your consent these were the basics but theres much more you can do the following sections cover installation usage and hosting of the recordings in more detail installation python package asciinema is available on pypi and can be installed with pip python 3 with setuptools required sudo pip3 install asciinema this is the recommended way of installation which gives you the latest released version native packages asciinema is included in repositories of most popular package managers on mac os x linux and freebsd look for package named asciinema see the list of available packages snap supported linux distros if you run ubuntu or other snap supported linux distribution you can install asciinema with snap install asciinema classic the snap contains all necessary dependencies required to run asciinema and will get automatically updated when a new version is pushed to the store docker image asciinema docker image is based on ubuntu 16 04 and has the latest version of asciinema recorder pre installed docker pull asciinema asciinema when running it dont forget to allocate a pseudo tty t keep stdin open i and mount config directory volume v docker run rm ti v home config asciinema root config asciinema asciinema asciinema default command run in a container is asciinema rec theres not much software installed in this image though in most cases you may want to install extra programs before recording one option is to derive new image from this one start your custom dockerfile with from asciinema asciinema another option is to start the container with bin bash as the command install extra packages and manually start asciinema rec docker run rm ti v home config asciinema root config asciinema asciinema asciinema bin bash root 6689517d99a1 apt get install foobar root 6689517d99a1 asciinema rec running latest version from source code checkout if none of the above works for you just clone the repo and run asciinema straight from the checkout clone the repo git clone https github com asciinema asciinema git cd asciinema if you want latest stable version git checkout master if you want current development version git checkout develop then run it with python3 m asciinema version usage asciinema is composed of multiple commands similar to git apt get or brew when you run asciinema with no arguments help message is displayed listing all available commands with their options rec filename record terminal session by running asciinema rec filename you start a new recording session the command process that is recorded can be specified with c option see below and defaults to shell which is what you want in most cases recording finishes when you exit the shell hit ctrl d or type exit if the recorded process is not a shell then recording finishes when the process exits if the filename argument is omitted then after asking for confirmation the resulting asciicast is uploaded to asciinema server by default to asciinema org where it can be watched and shared if the filename argument is given then the resulting recording called asciicast is saved to a local file it can later be replayed with asciinema play filename and or uploaded to asciinema server with asciinema upload filename asciinema rec 1 is added to recorded process environment variables this can be used by your shells config file bashrc zshrc to alter the prompt or play a sound when the shell is being recorded available options stdin enable stdin keyboard recording see below append append to existing recording raw save raw stdout output without timing information or other metadata overwrite overwrite the recording if it already exists c command command specify command to record defaults to shell e env var names list of environment variables to capture defaults to shell term t title title specify the title of the asciicast i idle time limit sec limit recorded terminal inactivity to max sec seconds y yes answer yes to all prompts e g upload confirmation q quiet be quiet suppress all notices warnings implies y stdin recording allows for capturing of all characters typed in by the user in the currently recorded shell this may be used by a player e g asciinema player to display pressed keys because its basically a key logging scoped to a single shell instance its disabled by default and has to be explicitly enabled via stdin option play filename replay recorded asciicast in a terminal this command replays given asciicast as recorded by rec command directly in your terminal following keyboard shortcuts are available space toggle pause step through a recording a frame at a time when paused ctrl c exit playing from a local file asciinema play path to asciicast cast playing from http

max sec seconds s speed factor playback speed can be fractional for the best playback experience it is recommended to run asciinema play in a terminal of dimensions not smaller than the one used for recording as theres no transcoding of control sequences for new terminal size cat filename print full output of recorded asciicast to a terminal while asciinema play filename replays the recorded session using timing information saved in the asciicast asciinema cat filename dumps the full output including all escape sequences to a terminal immediately asciinema cat existing cast output txt gives the same result as recording via asciinema rec raw output txt upload filename upload recorded asciicast to asciinema org site this command uploads given asciicast recorded by rec command to asciinema org where it can be watched and shared asciinema rec demo cast asciinema play demo cast asciinema upload demo cast is a nice combo if you want to review an asciicast before publishing it on asciinema org auth link your install id with your asciinema org user account if you want to manage your recordings change title theme delete at asciinema org you need to link your install id with asciinema org user account this command displays the url to open in a web browser to do that you may be asked to log in first install id is a random id uuid v4 generated locally when you run asciinema for the first time and saved at home config asciinema install id its purpose is to connect local machine with uploaded recordings so they can later be associated with asciinema org account this way we decouple uploading from account creation allowing them to happen in any order a new install id is generated on each machine and system user account you use asciinema on so in order to keep all recordings under a single asciinema org account you need to run asciinema auth on all of those machines asciinema versions prior to 2 0 confusingly referred to install id as api token hosting the recordings on the web as mentioned in the usage rec section above if the filename argument to asciinema rec is omitted then the recorded asciicast is uploaded to asciinema org you can watch it there and share it via secret url if you prefer to host the recordings yourself you can do so by either recording to a file asciinema rec demo cast and using asciinemas standalone web player in your html page or setting up your own asciinema server instance and setting api url accordingly configuration file you can configure asciinema by creating config file at home config asciinema config configuration is split into sections api record play heres a list of all available options for each section ini api api server url default https asciinema org if you run your own instance of asciinema server then set its address here it can also be overriden by setting asciinema api url environment variable url https asciinema example com record command to record default shell command bin bash l

replayed terminal inactivity to max n seconds default off idle time limit 1 a very minimal config file could look like that ini record idle time limit 2 config directory location can be changed by setting asciinema config home environment variable if xdg config home is set on linux then asciinema uses xdg config home asciinema instead of home config asciinema asciinema versions prior to 1 1 used home asciinema if you have it there you should mv home asciinema home config asciinema contributing if you want to contribute to this project check out contributing page authors developed with
