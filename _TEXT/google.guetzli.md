introduction guetzli is a jpeg encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high visual quality guetzli generated images are typically 20 30 smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg guetzli generates only sequential nonprogressive jpegs due to faster decompression speeds they offer building on posix systems get a copy of the source code either by cloning this repository or by downloading an archive and unpacking it install libpng if using your operating system package manager install development versions of the packages if the distinction exists on ubuntu do apt get install libpng dev on fedora do dnf install libpng devel on arch linux do pacman s libpng on alpine linux do apk add libpng dev run make and expect the binary to be created in bin release guetzli on windows get a copy of the source code either by cloning this repository or by downloading an archive and unpacking it install visual studio 2015 and vcpkg install libpng using vcpkg \vcpkg install libpng cause the installed packages to be available system wide \vcpkg integrate install if you prefer not to do this refer to vcpkgs documentation open the visual studio project enclosed in the repository and build it on macos to install using homebrew 1 install homebrew 2 brew install guetzli to install using the repository 1 get a copy of the source code either by cloning this repository or by downloading an archive and unpacking it 2 install homebrew or macports 3 install libpng using homebrew brew install libpng using macports port install libpng you may need to use sudo 4 run the following command to build the binary in bin release guetzli if you installed using homebrew simply use make if you installed using macports use cflags i opt local include ldflags l opt local lib make with bazel theres also a bazel build configuration provided if you have bazel installed you can also compile guetzli by running bazel build c opt guetzli using note guetzli uses a large amount of memory you should provide 300mb of memory per 1mpix of the input image note guetzli uses a significant amount of cpu time you should count on using about 1 minute of cpu per 1 mpix of input image note guetzli assumes that input is in srgb profile with a gamma of 2 2 guetzli will ignore any color profile metadata in the image to try out guetzli you need to build or download the guetzli binary the binary reads a png or jpeg image and creates an optimized jpeg image bash guetzli quality q verbose original png output jpg guetzli quality q verbose original jpg output jpg note that guetzli is designed to work on high quality images you should always prefer providing uncompressed input images e g that havent been already compressed with any jpeg encoders including guetzli while it will work on other images too results will be poorer you can try compressing an enclosed sample high quality image you can pass a quality q parameter to set quality in units equivalent to libjpeg quality you can also pass a verbose flag to see a trace of encoding attempts made please note that jpeg images do not support alpha channel transparency if the input is a png with an alpha channel it will be overlaid on black background before encoding
