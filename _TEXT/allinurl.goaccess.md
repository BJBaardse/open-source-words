goaccess what is it goaccess is an open source real time web log analyzer and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal on ast nix systems or through your browser it provides fast and valuable http statistics for system administrators that require a visual server report on the fly more info at https goaccess io features goaccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the x terminal features include completely real time all panels and metrics are timed to be updated every 200 ms on the terminal output and every second on the html output minimal configuration needed you can just run it against your access log file pick the log format and let goaccess parse the access log and show you the stats track application response time track the time taken to serve the request extremely useful if you want to track pages that are slowing down your site nearly all web log formats goaccess allows any custom log format string predefined options include apache nginx amazon s3 elastic load balancing cloudfront etc incremental log processing need data persistence goaccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on disk b tree database only one dependency goaccess is written in c to run it you only need ncurses as a dependency thats it it even features its own web socket server â€” http gwsocket io visitors determine the amount of hits visitors bandwidth and metrics for slowest running requests by the hour or date metrics per virtual host have multiple virtual hosts server blocks a panel that displays which virtual host is consuming most of the web server resources color scheme customizable tailor goaccess to suit your own color taste schemes either through the terminal or by simply applying the stylesheet on the html output support for large datasets goaccess features an on disk b tree storage for large datasets where it is not possible to fit everything in memory docker support ability to build goaccess docker image from upstream you can still fully configure it by using volume mapping and editing goaccess conf see docker section below nearly all web log formats goaccess allows any custom log format string predefined options include but not limited to amazon cloudfront download distribution amazon simple storage service s3 aws elastic load balancing combined log format xlf elf apache nginx common log format clf apache google cloud storage apache virtual hosts squid native format w3c format iis why goaccess goaccess was designed to be a fast terminal based log analyzer its core idea is to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time without needing to use your browser great if you want to do a quick analysis of your access log via ssh or if you simply love working in the terminal while the terminal output is the default output it has the capability to generate a complete self contained real time html report as well as a json and csv report you can see it more of a monitor command tool than anything else installation build from release goaccess can be compiled and used on nix systems download extract and compile goaccess with wget https tar goaccess io goaccess 1 2 tar gz tar xzvf

not all distributions will have the lastest version of goaccess available debian ubuntu apt get install goaccess note it is likely this will install an outdated version of goaccess to make sure that youre running the latest stable version of goaccess see alternative option below official goaccess debian ubuntu repository echo deb https deb goaccess io lsb release cs main sudo tee a etc apt sources list d goaccess list wget o https deb goaccess io gnugpg key sudo apt key add sudo apt get update sudo apt get install goaccess note for on disk support trusty or wheezy run sudo apt get

different prefix if you like or if you run as non root user mkdir p srv goaccess data html before running your own goaccess docker container first create a config file in srv goaccess data you can start one from scratch or use the one from config goaccess conf as a starting point and change it as needed a minimal config file for a real time html report requires at least the following options log format log file output and real time html for example for apaches combined log format log format combined log file srv logs access log output srv report index html real time html true if you want to expose goaccess on a different port on the host machine you have to set the ws url option in the config file e g ws url ws example com 8080 or for secured connections tls ssl please ensure your configuration file contains the following lines ssl cert srv data domain crt ssl key srv data domain key ws url wss example com 8080 once you have your configuration file all set clone the repo git clone https github com allinurl goaccess git goaccess cd and then build and run the image as follows docker build t allinurl goaccess docker run restart always d p 7890 7890 \ v srv goaccess data srv data \ v srv goaccess html srv report \ v var log apache2 srv logs \ name goaccess allinurl goaccess if you you made changes to the config file after building the image you dont have to rebuild from scratch simply restart the container docker restart goaccess and restart the container as follows docker run restart always d p 8080 7890 \ v srv goaccess data srv data \ v srv goaccess html srv report \ v var log apache srv logs \ name goaccess allinurl goaccess if you had already run the container you may have to stop and remove it first docker stop goaccess docker rm goaccess note it is possible to specify a different command and command line options to run in the container directly on the docker command line e g docker run restart always d p 8080 7890 \ v srv goaccess data srv data \ v srv goaccess html srv report \ v var log apache srv logs \ name goaccess allinurl goaccess \ goaccess no global config config file srv data goaccess conf \ ws url example org 8080 output srv report index html \ log file srv logs access log the container and image can be completely removed as follows docker stop goaccess docker rm goaccess docker rmi allinurl goaccess there is also a prebuilt docker image that can be run without cloning the git repository docker run restart always d p 8080 7890 \ v srv goaccess data srv data \ v srv goaccess logs srv logs \ v srv goaccess html srv report \ name goaccess allinurl goaccess storage there are three storage options that can be used with goaccess choosing one will depend on your environment and needs default hash tables in memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting the dataset size to the amount of available physical memory by default goaccess uses in memory hash tables if your dataset can fit in memory then this will perform fine it has very good memory usage and pretty good performance tokyo cabinet on disk b tree use this storage method for large datasets where it is not possible to fit everything in memory the b tree database is slower than any of the hash databases since data has to be committed to disk however using an ssd greatly increases the performance you may also use this storage method if you need data persistence to quickly load statistics at a later date tokyo cabinet on memory hash database an alternative to the default hash tables it uses generic typing and thus its performance in terms of memory and speed is average command line config options see options that can be supplied to the command or specified in the configuration file if specified in the configuration file long options need to be used without prepending usage examples note piping data into goaccess wont prompt a log date time configuration dialog you will need to previously define it in your configuration file or in the command line getting started to output to a terminal and generate an interactive report goaccess access log to generate an html report goaccess access log a report html to generate a json report goaccess access log a d o json report json to generate a csv file goaccess access log no csv summary o csv report csv goaccess also allows great flexibility for real time filtering and parsing for instance to quickly diagnose issues by monitoring logs since goaccess was started tail f access log goaccess and even better to filter while maintaining opened a pipe to preserve real time analysis we can make use of tail f and a matching pattern tool such as grep awk sed etc tail f access log grep i line buffered firefox goaccess log format combined or to parse from the beginning of the file while maintaining the pipe opened and applying a filter tail f n 0 access log grep i line buffered firefox goaccess o report html real time html multiple log files there are several ways to parse multiple logs with goaccess the simplest is to pass multiple log files to the command line goaccess access log access log 1 its even possible to parse files from a pipe while reading regular files cat access log 2 goaccess access log access log 1 note the single dash is appended to the command line to let goaccess know that it should read from the pipe now if we want to add more flexibility to goaccess we can do a series of pipes for instance if we would like to process all compressed log files access log gz in addition to the current log file we can do zcat access log gz goaccess access log note on mac os x use gunzip c instead of zcat real time html output goaccess has the ability the output real time data in the html report you can even email the html file since it is composed of a single file with no external file dependencies how neat is that the process of generating a real time html report is very similar to the process of creating a static report only real time html is needed to make it real time goaccess access log o usr share nginx html your site report html real time html to view the report you can navigate to http your site report html by default goaccess will use the host name of the generated report optionally you can specify the url to which the clients browser will connect to see https goaccess io faq for a more detailed example goaccess access log o report html real time html ws url goaccess io by default goaccess listens on port 7890 to use a different port other than 7890 you can specify it as make sure the port is opened goaccess access log o report html real time html port 9870 and to bind the websocket server to a different address other than 0 0 0 0 you can specify it as goaccess access log o report html real time html addr 127 0 0 1 note to output real time data over a tls ssl connection you need to use ssl cert cert crt and ssl key priv key filtering working with dates another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log the following will get all http requests starting on 05 dec 2010 until the end of the file sed n 05\ dec\ 2010 p access log goaccess a or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day sed n date d\ b\ y d 1 week ago p access log goaccess a if we want to parse only a certain time frame from date a to date b we can do sed n 5\ nov\ 2010 5\ dec\ 2010 p access log goaccess a virtual hosts assuming your log contains the virtual host field for instance vhost io 80 8 8 4 4 02 mar 2016 08 14 04 0600 get shop http 1 1 200 615 googlebot image 1 0 and you would like to append the virtual host to the request in order to see which virtual host the top urls belong to awk 8 1 8 access log goaccess a to do the same but also use real time filtering and parsing tail f access log unbuffer p awk 8 1 8 goaccess a to exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following grep v cat exclude vhost list file vhost access log goaccess files status codes to parse specific pages e g page views html htm php etc within a request awk 7 \ html \ htm \ php access log goaccess note 7 is the request field for the common and combined log format without virtual host if your log includes virtual host then you probably want to use 8 instead its best to check which field you are shooting for e g tail 10 access log awk print 8 or to parse a specific status code e g 500 internal server error awk 9 500 access log goaccess tips also it is worth pointing out that if we want to run goaccess at lower priority we can run it as nice n 19 goaccess f access log a and if you dont want to install it on your server you can still run it from your local machine ssh root server cat var log apache2 access log goaccess a incremental log processing goaccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on disk b tree database it works in the following way a data set must be persisted first with keep db files then the same data set can be loaded with load from disk if new data is passed piped or through a log file it will append it to the original data set to preserve the data at all times keep db files must be used if load from disk is used without keep db files database files will be deleted upon closing the program examples last month access log goaccess access log 1 keep db files then load it with append this month access log and preserve new data goaccess access log load from disk keep db files to read persisted data only without parsing new data goaccess load from disk keep db files contributing any help on goaccess is welcome the most helpful way is to try it out and give feedback feel free to use the github issue tracker and pull requests to discuss and submit code changes enjoy
