textql allows you to easily execute sql against structured text like csv or tsv example session major changes since there has been some time since the initial release of textql ive made some improvements as well as made the project much more modular theres also been a additional performance tweaks and added functionality but this comes at the cost of breaking the original command line flags and changing the install command changes since v1 additions numeric values are automatically recognized in more cases date time datetime values are automatically recognized in reasonable formats see time strings for a list for accepted formats and how to convert from other formats added join support multiple files directories can be loaded by listing them at the end of the command directories are read by reading each file inside and this is non recursive you can list as many files directories as you like added flag output file to save output directly to a file added flag output dlm to modify the output delimiter added short sql syntax for the case of a single table the from table can be dropped from the query for simple selects the select keyword can be dropped from the query this means the v1 command textql sql select from tbl source some file csv can be shortened to textql sql some file csv changes the flag outputheader was renamed to output header removals dropped the ability to override table names this makes less sense after the automatic tablename generation based on filename joins and shorter sql syntax changes removed source any files paths at the end of the command are used as well as piped in data bug fixes writing to a directory no longer fails silently key differences between textql and sqlite importing sqlite import will not accept stdin breaking unix pipes textql will happily do so textql supports quote escaped delimiters sqlite does not textql leverages the sqlite in memory database feature as much as possible and only touches disk if asked is it any good yes requirements go 1 4 or later install latest release on homebrew os x bash brew install textql build from source bash go get u github com dinedal textql docker first build the image bash docker build t textql now use that image mounting your current directory into the container bash docker run rm it v pwd tmp textql rest of command alias you can add the following alias to your system to provide quick access to textql bash alias textql docker run rm it v pwd tmp textql usage bash textql console save to path path output file path output dlm delimter output header pretty quiet header dlm delimter sql sql statements path console after all statements are run open sqlite3 repl with this data dlm string input delimiter character between fields dlm tab for tab dlm 0x to specify a character code in hex default header treat input files as having the first row as a header row output dlm string output delimiter character between fields output dlm tab for tab dlm 0x to specify a character code in hex default output file file filename to write output to if empty no output is written default stdout output header display column names in output quiet surpress logging pretty pretty print output save to file sqlite3 db is left on disk at this file sql string sql statement s to run on the data version print version and exit license new mit license copyright c 2015 2016 paul bergeron http pauldbergeron com see license for details
