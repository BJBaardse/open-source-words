raspberry pi qnap ios openwrt chrome os openbsd termux if you have successfully tested this script on others systems or platforms please let me know running as cron job dropbox uploader relies on a different configuration file for each system user the default configuration file location is home dropbox uploader this means that if you setup the script with your user and then you try to run a cron job as root it wont work so when running this script using cron please keep in mind the following remember to setup the script with the user used to run the cron job always specify the full script path when running it e g path to dropbox uploader sh use always the f option to specify the full configuration file path because sometimes in the cron environment the home folder path is not detected correctly e g f home youruser dropbox uploader my advice is for security reasons to not share the same configuration file with different users how to setup a proxy to use a proxy server just set the
