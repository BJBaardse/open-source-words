flex flex flipboard explorer is a set of in app debugging and exploration tools for ios development when presented flex shows a toolbar that lives in a window above your application from this toolbar you can view and modify nearly every piece of state in your running application give yourself debugging superpowers inspect and modify views in the hierarchy see the properties and ivars on any object dynamically modify many properties and ivars dynamically call instance and class methods observe detailed network request history with timing headers and full responses add your own simulator keyboard shortcuts view system log messages e g from nslog access any live object via a scan of the heap view the file system within your apps sandbox browse sqlite realm databases in the file system trigger 3d touch in the simulator using the control shift and command keys explore all classes in your app and linked systems frameworks public and private quickly access useful objects such as uiapplication sharedapplication the app delegate the root view controller on the key window and more dynamically view and modify nsuserdefaults values unlike many other debugging tools flex runs entirely inside your app so you dont need to be connected to lldb xcode or a different remote debugging server it works well in the simulator and on physical devices usage in the ios simulator you can use keyboard shortcuts to activate flex f will toggle the flex toolbar hit the key for a full list of shortcuts you can also show flex programatically short version objc objective c flexmanager sharedmanager

modify views once a view is selected you can tap on the info bar below the toolbar to present more details about the view from there you can modify properties and call methods network history when enabled network debugging allows you to view all requests made using nsurlconnection or nsurlsession settings allow you to adjust what kind of response bodies get cached and the maximum size limit of the response cache you can choose to have network debugging enabled automatically on app launch this setting is persisted across launches all objects on the heap flex queries malloc for all the live allocated memory blocks and searches for ones that look like objects you can see everything from here simulator keyboard shortcuts default keyboard shortcuts allow you to activate the flex tools scroll with the arrow keys and close modals using the escape key you can also add custom keyboard shortcuts via flexmananger registersimulatorshortcutwithkey modifiers action description file browser view the file system within your apps sandbox flex shows file sizes image previews and pretty prints json and plist files you can copy text and image files to the pasteboard if you want to inspect them outside of your app sqlite browser sqlite database files with either db or sqlite extensions or realm database files can be explored using flex the database browser lets you view all tables and individual tables can be sorted by tapping column headers 3d touch in the simulator using a combination of the command control and shift keys you can simulate different levels of 3d touch pressure in the simulator each key contributes 1 3 of maximum possible force note that you need to move the touch slightly to get pressure updates system library exploration go digging for all things public and private to learn more about a class you can create an instance of it and explore its default state nsuserdefaults editing flex allows you to edit defaults that are any combination of strings numbers arrays and dictionaries the input is parsed as json if other kinds of objects are set for a defaults key i e nsdate you can view them but not edit them learning from other apps the code injection is left as an exercise for the reader innocent installation flex requires an app that targets ios 7 or higher cocoapods flex is available on cocoapods simply add the following line to your podfile ruby pod flex 2 0 configurations debug carthage add the following to your cartfile github flipboard flex 2 0 manual manually add the files in classes to your xcode project excluding flex from release app store builds flex makes it easy to explore the internals of your app so it is not something you should expose to your users fortunately it is easy to exclude flex files from release builds the strategies differ depending on how you integrated flex in your project and are described below at the places in your code where you integrate flex do a if debug check to ensure the tool is only accessible in your debug builds and to avoid errors in your release builds for more help with integrating flex see the example project flex added with cocoapods cocoapods automatically excludes flex from release builds if you only specify the debug configuration for flex in your podfile flex added with carthage if you are using carthage only including the flex framework in debug builds is easy do not add flex framework to the embedded binaries of your target as it would otherwise be included in all builds therefore also in release ones instead add project dir carthage build ios to your target framework search paths this setting might already be present if you already included other frameworks with carthage this makes it possible to import the flex framework from your source files it does not harm if this setting is added for all configurations but it should at least be added for the debug one add a run script phase to your target inserting it after the existing link binary with libraries phase for example and which will embed flex framework in debug builds only shell if configuration debug then usr local bin carthage copy frameworks fi finally add srcroot carthage build ios flex framework as input file of this script phase flex files added manually to a project in xcode navigate to the build settings tab of your project click the plus and select add user defined setting name the setting excluded source file names for your release configuration set the value to flex this will exclude all files with the prefix flex from compilation leave the value blank for your debug configuration additional notes when setting fields of type id or values in nsuserdefaults flex attempts to parse the input string as json this allows you to use a combination of strings numbers arrays and dictionaries if you want to set a string value it must be wrapped in quotes for ivars or properties that are explicitly typed as nsstrings quotes are not required you may want to disable the exception breakpoint while using flex certain functions that flex uses throw exceptions when they get input they cant handle i e nsgetsizeandalignment flex catches these to avoid crashing but your breakpoint will get hit if it is active thanks credits flex builds on ideas and inspiration from open source tools that came before it the following resources have been particularly helpful dcintrospect view hierarchy debugging for the ios simulator ponydebugger network core data and view hierarchy debugging using the chrome developer tools interface mike ash well written informative blog posts on all things obj c and more the links below were very useful for this project maobjcruntime lets build key value coding arm64 and you rhobjectivebeagle a tool for scanning the heap for live objects it should be noted that the source code of rhobjectivebeagle was not consulted due to licensing concerns heap find cpp an example of enumerating malloc blocks for finding objects on the heap gist from samdmarshall another example of enumerating malloc blocks non pointer isa an explanation of changes to the isa field on ios for arm64 and mention of the useful objc debug isa class mask
