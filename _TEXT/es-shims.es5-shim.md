es5 shim es5 shim js and es5 shim min js monkey patch a javascript context to contain all ecmascript 5 methods that can be faithfully emulated with a legacy javascript engine note as es5 shim js is designed to patch the native javascript engine it should be the library that is loaded first es5 sham js and es5 sham min js monkey patch other es5 methods as closely as possible for these methods as closely as possible to es5 is not very close many of these shams are intended only to allow code to be written to es5 without causing run time errors in older engines in many cases this means that these shams cause many es5 methods to silently fail decide carefully whether this is what you want note es5 sham js requires es5 shim js to be able to work properly tests the tests are written with the jasmine bdd test framework to run the tests navigate to tests or simply npm install and npm test shims complete tests array prototype every array prototype filter array prototype foreach array

object create for the case of simply begetting an object that inherits prototypically from another this should work fine across legacy engines warning the second argument is passed to object defineproperties which will probably fail either silently or with extreme prejudice warning object getprototypeof this will return undefined in some cases it uses proto if its available failing that it uses constructor prototype which depends on the constructor property of the objects prototype having not been replaced if your object was created like this it wont work function foo foo prototype because the prototype reassignment destroys the constructor property this will work for all objects that were created using object create implemented with this library warning object getownpropertynames this method uses object keys so it will not be accurate on legacy engines object issealed returns false in all legacy engines for all objects which is conveniently guaranteed to be accurate object isfrozen returns false in all legacy engines for all objects which is conveniently guaranteed to be accurate object isextensible works like a charm by trying very hard to extend the object then redacting the extension may fail warning object getownpropertydescriptor the behavior of this shim does not conform to es5 it should probably not be used at this time until its behavior has been reviewed and been confirmed to be useful in legacy engines warning object defineproperty in the worst of circumstances ie 8 provides a version of this method that only works on dom objects this sham will not be installed the given version of defineproperty will throw an exception if used on non dom objects in slightly better circumstances this method will silently fail to set writable enumerable and configurable properties providing a getter or setter with get or set on a descriptor will silently fail on engines that lack definegetter and definesetter which include all versions of ie https github com es shims es5 shim issues issue 5 warning object defineproperties this uses the object defineproperty shim object seal silently fails on all legacy engines this should be fine unless you are depending on the safety and security provisions of this method which you cannot possibly obtain in legacy engines object freeze silently fails on all legacy engines this should be fine
