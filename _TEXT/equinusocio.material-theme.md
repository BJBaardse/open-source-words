this project is no longer under active development since sublime text is an obsolete software for me compared to other editors please consider material theme for visual studio code read the deprecation note this repo will keep approving prs from contributors this theme brings the material design visual language to your sublime text 3 if you have problems first search for a similiar issue and then report a new one please read the known issues section before reporting a new one any issue that does not use the issue template and any issue related to the known issues section will be automatically closed deprecation note i was a sublime text user for years for years sublime text 2 has not received updates it was totally abandoned by is author until wbond and others start working on it after 3 years of v3 beta and only bugfixing i can consider it an obsolete commercial software now v3 is out and there are not new features out of the bos st is like a commercial nodepad is not hard to think a 80 commercial software that is 80 cracked or used in free mode no modern languages integrations built in you have to hope that some developer build an extension no linters integrations no automplete across files for css html js typescript etc without some ram eater extensions lack of functionalities like markdown preview svg preview tasks git theme engine obsolete and very hard to manage closed community with not support and many other issues visual studio code atom or intellij have a lot of built in features and vsc and atom are free open source with a huge community and monthly useful updates with vsc or intellij you need extension to extend the software not to build it with st you install the basic text editor and you have to install a lot of extensions to make it a bit useful it is fast yes but because it does not have anything vsc free open source and followed community lot of improvements and features released every month a lot of integrations with modern languages out of the box fast git integration tasks integration debug integration many others you think that sublime text is a good editor ok you can still pay 80 for it or use it as a free editor and
