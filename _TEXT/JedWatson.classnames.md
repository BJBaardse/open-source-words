classnames a simple javascript utility for conditionally joining classnames together install with npm bower or yarn npm sh npm install classnames save bower sh bower install classnames save yarn note that yarn add automatically saves the package to the dependencies in package json sh yarn add classnames use with node js browserify or webpack js var classnames require classnames classnames foo bar foo bar alternatively you can simply include index js on your page with a standalone script tag and it will export a global classnames method or define the module if you are using requirejs project philosophy we take the stability and performance of this package seriously because it is run millions of times a day in browsers all around the world updates are thoroughly reviewed for performance impacts before being released and we have a comprehensive test suite classnames follows the semver standard for versioning there is also a changelog usage the classnames function takes any number of arguments which can be a string or object the argument foo is short for foo true if the value associated with a given key is falsy that key wont be included in the output js classnames foo bar foo bar classnames foo bar true foo bar classnames foo bar true foo bar classnames foo bar false classnames foo true bar true foo bar classnames foo true bar true foo bar lots of arguments of various types classnames foo bar true duck false baz quux true foo bar baz quux other falsy values are just ignored classnames null false bar undefined 0 1 baz null bar 1 arrays will be recursively flattened as per the rules above js var arr b c true d false classnames a arr a b c dynamic class names with es2015 if youre in an environment that supports computed keys available in es2015 and babel you can use dynamic class names js let buttontype primary classnames btn buttontype true usage with react js this package is the official replacement for classset which was originally shipped in the react js addons bundle one of its primary use cases is to make dynamic and conditional classname props simpler to work with especially more so than conditional string manipulation so where you may have the following code to generate a classname prop for a button in react js var button react createclass render var btnclass btn if this state ispressed btnclass btn pressed else if this state ishovered btnclass btn over return button classname btnclass this props label button you can express the conditional classes more simply as an object js var classnames require classnames var button react createclass render var btnclass classnames btn true btn pressed this state ispressed btn over this state ispressed this state ishovered return this props label because you can mix together object array and string arguments supporting optional classname props is also simpler as only truthy arguments get included in the result js var btnclass classnames btn this props classname btn pressed this state ispressed btn over this state ispressed this state ishovered alternate dedupe version there is an alternate version of classnames available which correctly dedupes classes and ensures that falsy classes specified in later arguments are excluded from the result set this version is slower about 5x so it is offered as an opt in to use the dedupe version with node js browserify or webpack js var classnames require classnames dedupe classnames foo foo bar foo bar classnames foo foo false bar true bar for standalone global amd use include dedupe js in a script tag on your page alternate bind version for css modules if you are using css modules or a similar approach to abstract class names and the real classname values that are actually output to the dom you may want to use the bind variant note that in es2015 environments it may be better to use the dynamic class names approach documented above js var classnames require classnames bind var styles foo abc bar def baz xyz var cx classnames bind styles var classname cx foo bar baz true abc def xyz real world example js components submit button js import component from react import classnames from classnames bind import styles from submit button css let cx classnames bind styles export default class submitbutton extends component render let text this props store submissioninprogress processing submit let classname cx base true inprogress this props store submissioninprogress error this props store erroroccurred disabled this props form valid return text polyfills needed to support older browsers classnames 2 0 0 array isarray see mdn for details about unsupported older browsers e g ie8 and a simple polyfill object keys see mdn for details about unsupported older browsers e g ie8 and a simple polyfill this is only used in dedupe js license mit copyright c 2017 jed watson
