netdata new to netdata here is a live demo http my netdata io netdata is a system for distributed real time performance and health monitoring it provides unparalleled insights in real time of everything happening on the system it runs including applications such as web and database servers using modern interactive web dashboards netdata is fast and efficient designed to permanently run on all systems physical virtual servers containers iot devices without disrupting their core function netdata runs on linux freebsd and macos user base docker pulls since may 16th 2016 the date the global public netdata registry was released in the last 24 hours news mar 27th 2018 netdata v1 10 0 released new web server a lot faster and more secure updated all javascript libraries to their latest versions fixed compatibility issues now netdata chart can now be embedded on atlassian confluence pages and remain fully interactive new plugins btrfs visualize btrfs allocation with alarms bcache monitor hybrid setups hdd ssd ceph nginx plus libreswan monitor the traffic of ipsec tunnels traefik icecast ntpd httpcheck monitor any remote web server portcheck monitor any remote tcp port spring boot monitor java spring boot apps dnsdist linux hugepages improved plugins statsd web log cgroups for containers and vms monitoring netdata now supports systemd nspawn and kubernetes fixed security issue with cgroup network linux memory diskspace network interfaces postgres rabbitmq apps plugin now it also tracks swap usage per process haproxy uptime ksm kernel memory debupper mdstat software raid elasticsearch apcupsd dhcpd fronius stiebeletron new alarm notification methods alerta irc post on irc channels and dozens more improvements enhancements features and compatibility fixes features stunning interactive bootstrap dashboards mouse and touch friendly in 2 themes dark light amazingly fast responds to all queries in less than 0 5 ms per metric even on low end hardware highly efficient collects thousands of metrics per server per second with just 1 cpu utilization of a single core a few mb of ram and no disk i o at all sophisticated alerting hundreds of alarms out of the box supports dynamic thresholds hysteresis alarm templates multiple role based notification methods such as email slack com flock com pushover net pushbullet com telegram org twilio com messagebird com kavenegar com extensible you can monitor anything you can get a metric for using its plugin api anything can be a netdata plugin bash python perl node js java go ruby etc embeddable it can run anywhere a linux kernel runs even iot and its charts can be embedded on your web pages too customizable custom dashboards can be built using simple html no javascript necessary zero configuration auto detects everything it can collect up to 5000 metrics per server out of the box zero dependencies it is even its own web server for its static web files and its web api zero maintenance you just run it it does the rest scales to infinity requiring minimal central resources several operating modes autonomous host monitoring headless data collector forwarding proxy store and forward proxy central multi host monitoring in all possible configurations each node may have different metrics retention policy and run with or without health monitoring time series back ends supported can archive its metrics on graphite opentsdb prometheus json document dbs in the same or lower detail lower to prevent it from congesting these servers due to the amount of data collected what does it monitor netdata collects several thousands of metrics per device all these metrics are collected and visualized in real time almost all metrics are auto detected without any configuration this is a list of what it currently monitors cpu usage interrupts softirqs frequency total and per core cpu states memory ram swap and kernel memory usage ksm kernel samepage merging numa disks per disk i o operations backlog

level overview of netdata feature set and architecture click it to to interact with it it has direct links to documentation installation use our automatic installer to build and install it on your system it should run on any linux system including iot it has been tested on alpine arch linux centos debian fedora gentoo opensuse pld linux redhat enterprise linux suse ubuntu interaction with netdata after installation you can interact with netdata using cli and web dashboards the default port of dashboard is 19999 to access the web dashboard on localhost use http localhost 19999
