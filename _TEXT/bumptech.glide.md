glide view glides documentation 简体中文文档 report an issue with glide glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for android that wraps media decoding memory and disk caching and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface glide supports fetching decoding and displaying video stills images and animated gifs glide includes a flexible api that allows developers to plug in to almost any network stack by default glide uses a custom httpurlconnection based stack but also includes utility libraries plug in to googles volley project or squares okhttp library instead glides primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible but glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch resize and display a remote image download for detailed instructions and requirements see glides download and setup docs page you can download a jar from githubs releases page or use gradle gradle

glide check out the documentation for pages on a variety of topics and see the javadocs for glide v3 see the wiki simple use cases with glides generated api will look something like this java for a

myimageview status version 4 is now released and stable updates are currently released at least monthly with new features and bug fixes comments bugs questions pull requests are always welcome please read contributing md on how to report issues compatibility minimum android sdk glide v4 requires a minimum api level of 14 compile android sdk glide v4 requires you to compile against api 26 or later if you need to support older versions of android consider staying on glide v3 which works on api 10 but is not actively maintained okhttp 3 x there is an optional dependency available called okhttp3 integration see the docs page volley there is an optional dependency available called volley integration see the docs page round pictures circleimageview circularimageview roundedimageview are known to have issues with transitiondrawable crossfade with thumbnail or placeholder and animated gifs use a bitmaptransformation circlecrop will be available in v4 or dontanimate to fix the issue huge images maps comic strips glide can load huge images by downsampling them but does not support zooming and panning imageviews as they require special resource optimizations such as tiling to work without outofmemoryerrors build building glide with gradle is fairly straight forward shell git clone https github com bumptech glide git cd glide gradlew jar note make sure your android sdk has the android support repository installed and that your android home environment variable is pointing at the sdk or add a local properties file in the root project with a sdk dir line samples follow the steps in the build section to set up the project and then shell gradlew samples flickr run gradlew samples giphy run gradlew samples svg run gradlew samples contacturi run you may also find precompiled apks on the releases page development follow the steps in the build section to setup the project and then edit the files however you wish android studio cleanly imports both glides source and tests and is the recommended way to work with glide to open the project in android studio go to file menu or the welcome screen click on open navigate to glides root directory select setting
