requirements operating system ruby adapters supported unix linux like ruby 1 9 3 all except rjgit yes unix linux like jruby 1 9 3 compatible rjgit yes windows ruby 1 9 3 all except rjgit no windows jruby 1 9 3 compatible rjgit almost1 notes there are still some bugs and this setup is not ready for production yet you can track the progress at support windows via jruby meta issue installation varies depending on operating system package manager and ruby installation generally you should first install ruby and then gollum ruby is best installed either via rvm or a package manager of choice gollum is best installed via rubygems sudo gem install gollum installation examples for individual systems can be seen here notes whichever ruby implementation youre using gollum ships with the appropriate default git adapter so the above installation procedure is common for both mri and jruby if youre installing from source optionally uninstall any previous versions of gollum sudo gem uninstall aix gollum install bundler navigate to the cloned source of gollum install dependencies sudo bundle install build rake build and install sudo gem install no document pkg gollum gem markups gollum presently ships with support for the following markups markdown rdoc since all markups are rendered by the github markup gem you can easily add support for other markups by additional installation asciidoc sudo gem install asciidoctor creole sudo gem install creole mediawiki sudo gem install wikicloth org sudo gem install org ruby pod requires perl 5 10 the perl command must be available on your command line lower versions should install pod simple from cpan restructuredtext requires python 2 the python2 command must be available on your command line note that gollum will also need you to install docutils for your python 2 installation procedure can again vary depending on operating system and package manager textile sudo gem install redcloth by default gollum ships with the kramdown gem to render markdown however you can use any markdown renderer supported by github markup the thing to remember is that the first installed renderer from the list will be used so for example redcarpet will not be used if github markdown is installed running simply navigate to your git repository wiki via the command line run gollum open http localhost 4567 in your browser this will start up a web server webrick running gollum with a web interface where you can view and edit your wiki running from source git clone https github com gollum gollum cd gollum sudo bundle install may not always be necessary bundle exec bin gollum like that gollum assumes the target wiki git repository is the project repository itself if its not execute bundle exec bin gollum path to wiki

alongside a cas central authentication service sso single sign on server with a bit of tweaking this adds basic user support to gollum to see an example and an explanation navigate over here docker
