for winds tutorials blog posts the following tutorials will not only help you start contributing to winds but also provide inspiration for your next app note were actively working on this portion of the readme to stay up to date with the latest information please signup for the hosted version at https getstream io winds architecting a large react redux codebase building activity streams and newsfeeds on top of stream implementing search with algolia mongodb database schema design design thought process for winds 2 0 pm2 in production environments creating a restful api design with

mercury key your key here note if you are running the test suite you will need to have a test version of the env file inside of the api test directory then run pm2 start process dev json cd app yarn start clone the repo bash git clone git github com getstream winds git install dependencies the following instructions are geared towards mac users who can use brew homebrew to install most dependencies ubuntu users can use apt and windows users will have to install directly from the dependencys site non debian based linux users will probably be able to figure it out on their own cd winds app yarn cd api yarn start mongodb locally winds uses mongodb as the main datastore it contains all users rss feeds podcasts episodes articles and shares if youre on a mac you can install mongodb through homebrew by running brew install mongodb you can also install mongodb from the official mongodb site you can also run mongodb in the background by running brew services start mongodb start redis locally at stream we use redis as an in memory storage for the winds podcast processing and rss processing workers it contains a list of podcasts and rss feeds which the workers pick up and process using the bull messaging system if youre on a mac you can install redis through homebrew by running brew install redis you can also install redis from the official redis site then start redis by running redis server which creates by default a dump rdb file in your current directory and stores a cached version of the database in that location you can also run redis in the background by running brew services start redis loading test data for testing purposes you will want to use the test data located here use mongoimport or mongorestore to import the data there are two username and password combinations for testing username admin admin com password admin username test test com password test you will need to run the flushall command in redis to ensure that the new content is picked up note this will override any local data that you may have please be cautious also this will not create stream follows â€“ please followo feeds manually to generate them stream sign up and create a stream app to contribute to winds sign up for stream to utilize the activity and timeline feeds reminder stream is free for applications with less than 3 000 000 updates per month sign up for stream here create a new stream app find the app id api key and api secret for your new stream app add your stream app id api key and api secret to your env append the stream app id api key and api secret to your env file stream app id your stream app id stream api key your stream api key stream api secret your stream api secret create your stream feed groups once youve signed in create feed groups for your stream app a feed group defines a certain type of feed within your application use the add feed group button to create the following feeds feed group name feed group type podcast flat rss flat user flat timeline flat user episode flat user article flat its fine to enable realtime notifications for each of these feed groups though we wont be using those yet algolia sign up for algolia and create an algolia app and index in addition to stream you also need to sign up for algolia to contribute to winds for the search functionality algolia is free for applications with up to 10k records sign up for algolia here from the applications page click new application and create a new algolia application we recommend something similar to my winds app select the datacenter thats closest to you from the application page select indices and click add new index we recommend something similar to winds main index add your algolia application id search only api key and admin api key to your env file from your app click the api keys button on the left to find your app id and api keys append your algolia application id search only api key and admin api key to your env file to look like this react app algolia app id your algolia app id react app algolia search key your algolia search only api key algolia write key your algolia admin api key start backend services from the root directory run pm2 start process dev json to see logging information for all processes run pm2 logs start frontend electron web app server cd app yarn start running tests winds api server uses mocha as testing framework chai as assertion library sinon as mocking library nock as http mocking library mock require as module mocking library tests are located in api test folder file structure is intentionally mirroring files in api src to simplify matching tests to tested code to run tests cd api yarn run test to run tests with extended stack traces useful when debugging async issues cd api yarn run test deep adding new tests add your code to a file in api test folder preferably mirroring existing file from api src folder refer to mocha documentation for examples of using bdd like dsl for writing tests modules are mocked in api test entry js as mocks have to be installed before any modules are loaded fixtures are loaded via loadfixture function from api test fixtures folder various utility functions are provided in api test util js see other tests for expamles of usage building a production version build a production version of winds by running build sh this creates production ready js files in api dist to run the production js files pm2 start process prod json debugging rss podcast issues unfortunately there is no unified standard for rss go to the api directory and run
