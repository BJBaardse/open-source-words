we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard john f kennedy 1962 welcome to apollos github page apollo is a high performance flexible architecture which accelerates the development testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles for business and partnership please visit our website table of contents getting started prerequisites basic requirements individual version requirements architecture installation documents getting started the apollo team now proudly presents to you the latest version 3 0 apollo 3 0 is loaded with new modules and features but needs to be callibrated and configured perfectly before you take it for a spin please review the prerequisites and installation steps in detail to ensure that you are well equipped to build and launch apollo you could also check out apollos architecture overview for a greater understanding on apollos core technology and platform want to contribute to our code follow this guide prerequisites basic requirements vehicle equipped with by wire system including but not limited to brake by wire steering by wire throttle by wire and shift by wire apollo is currently tested on lincoln mkz a machine with a 4 core processor and 6gb memory minimum ubuntu 14 04 working knowledge of docker please note it is recommended that you install the versions of apollo in the following order 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 the reason behind this recommendation is that you need to confirm whether individual hardware components and modules are functioning correctly and clear various version test cases before progressing to a higher more capable version for your safety and the safety of those around you please note if you do not have a vehicle proceed to the installation without hardware individual version requirements the following diagram highlights the scope and features of each apollo release apollo 1 0 apollo 1 0 also referred to as the automatic gps waypoint following works in an enclosed venue such as a test track or parking lot this installation is necessary to ensure that apollo works perfectly with your vehicle the diagram below lists the various modules in apollo 1 0 for setup hardware industrial pc ipc global positioning system gps inertial measurement unit imu controller area network can card hard drive gps antenna gps receiver software apollo linux kernel based on linux kernel 4 4 32 apollo 1 5 apollo 1 5 is meant for fixed lane cruising with the addition of lidar vehicles with this version now have better perception of its surroundings and can better map its current position and plan its trajectory for safer maneuvering on its lane please note the modules highlighted in yellow are additions or upgrades for version 1 5 for setup all the requirements mentioned in version 1 0 hardware light detection and ranging system lidar asus gtx1080 gpu a8g gaming gpu card software nvidia gpu driver apollo 2 0 apollo 2 0 supports vehicles autonomously driving on simple urban roads vehicles are able to cruise on roads safely avoid collisions with obstacles stop at traffic lights and change lanes if needed to reach their destination please note the modules highlighted in red are additions or upgrades for version 2 0 for setup all the requirements mentioned in versions 1 5 and 1 0 hardware traffic light detection using camera ranging system lidar radar software same as 1 5 apollo 2 5 apollo 2 5 allows the vehicle to autonomously run on geo fenced highways with a camera for obstacle detection vehicles are able to maintain lane control cruise and avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of them please note if you need to test apollo 2 5 for safety purposes please seek the help of the apollo engineering team your safety is our 1 priority and we want to ensure apollo 2 5 was integrated correctly with your vehicle before you hit the road for setup all the requirements mentioned in 2 0 hardware additional camera software same as 2 0 apollo 3 0 apollo 3 0s main focus is to provide a platform for developers to build upon in a closed venue low speed environment vehicles are able to maintain lane control cruise and avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of them for setup hardware ultrasonic sensors apollo sensor unit apollo hardware development platform with additional sensor support and flexibility software guardian monitor additional drivers to support hardware architecture hardware vehicle overview hardware connection overview software overview navigation mode installation fork and then clone apollos github code build and release using docker this step is required launch and run apollo if at this point you do not have a hardware setup please go to without hardware with hardware apollo 1 0
