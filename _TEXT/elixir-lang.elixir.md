elixir is a dynamic functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications for more about elixir installation and documentation check elixirs website compiling from source to run elixir from source clone this repository to your machine compile and test it sh git clone https github com elixir lang elixir git cd elixir make clean test note if you are running on windows this article includes important notes for compiling elixir from source on windows if elixir fails to build specifically when pulling in a new version via git be sure to remove any previous build artifacts by running make clean then make test if tests pass you are ready to move on to the getting started guide or to try interactive elixir by running bin iex in your terminal however if tests fail it is likely you have an outdated erlang otp version elixir requires erlang otp 19 0 or later you can check your erlang otp version by calling erl in the command line you will see some information as follows erlang otp 19 erts 8 0 smp 2 2 async threads 10 kernel poll false if you have properly set up your dependencies and tests still fail you may want to open up a bug report as explained next bug reports for reporting bugs visit our issues tracker and follow the steps for reporting a new issue please disclose security vulnerabilities privately at elixir security googlegroups com proposing new features for proposing new features please start a discussion in the elixir core mailing list keep in mind that it is your responsibility to argue and explain why a feature is useful and how it will impact the codebase and the community once a proposal is accepted it will be added to the issues tracker the issues tracker focuses on actionable items and it holds a list of upcoming enhancements and pending bugs all entries in the tracker are tagged for clarity and to ease collaboration features and bug fixes that have already been merged and will be included in the next release are marked as closed in the issues tracker and are added to the changelog finally remember all interactions in our official spaces follow our code of conduct contributing we welcome everyone to contribute to elixir to do so there are a few things you need to know about the code first elixir code is divided in applications inside the lib folder elixir contains elixirs kernel and stdlib eex template engine that allows you to embed elixir ex unit simple test framework that ships with elixir iex iex elixirs interactive shell logger the built in logger mix elixirs build tool you can run all tests in the root directory with make test and you can also run tests for a specific framework make test name for example make test ex unit if you just changed something in the elixirs standard library you can run only that portion through make test stdlib if you are changing just one file you can choose to compile and run tests only for that particular file for fast development cycles for example if you are changing the string module you can compile it and run its tests as sh bin elixirc lib elixir lib string ex o lib elixir ebin bin elixir lib elixir test elixir string test exs to recompile including erlang modules sh make compile after your changes are done please remember to run the full suite with make test and then mix format to guarantee all files are properly formatted if your contribution fails during the bootstrapping of the language you can rebuild the language from scratch with sh make clean elixir compile similarly if you cant get elixir to compile or the tests to pass after updating an existing checkout run make clean compile you can check the official build status on travis ci more tasks can be found by reading the makefile with tests running and passing you are ready to contribute to elixir and send a pull request we have saved some excellent pull requests we have received in the past in case you are looking for some examples implement enum member – pull request add string valid – pull request implement capture io for exunit – pull request reviewing changes once a pull request is sent the elixir team will review your changes we outline our process below to clarify the roles of everyone involved all pull requests must be approved by two committers before being merged into the repository if any changes are necessary the team will leave appropriate comments requesting changes to the code unfortunately we cannot guarantee a pull request will be merged even when modifications are requested as the elixir team will re evaluate the contribution as it changes committers may also push style changes directly to your branch if you would rather manage all changes yourself you can disable allow edits from maintainers feature when submitting your pull request the elixir team may optionally assign someone to review a pull request if someone is assigned they must explicitly approve the code before another team member can merge it when the review finishes your pull request will be squashed and merged into the repository if you have carefully organized your commits and believe they should be merged without squashing leave a comment building documentation building the documentation requires exdoc to be installed and built alongside elixir sh after cloning and compiling elixir in its parent directory git clone git github com elixir lang ex doc git cd ex doc elixir bin mix do deps get compile cd elixir make docs this will produce documentation sets for elixir mix etc under the doc directory if you are planning to contribute documentation
