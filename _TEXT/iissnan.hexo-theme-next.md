config yml and other options in themes config yml this approach is applicable but has some drawbacks 1 configurations are splited into two pieces 2 users maybe confuse which place should be for options in order to resolve this issue next will take advantage of hexo data files because data files is introduced in hexo 3 so you need upgrade hexo to 3 0 or above to use this feature if you prefer hexo 2 x you can still use the old approach for configurations next is still compatible with hexo 2 x benefits with this feature now you can put all your configurations into one place source data next
