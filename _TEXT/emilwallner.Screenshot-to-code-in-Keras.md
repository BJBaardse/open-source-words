turning design mockups into code with deep learning this is the code for the article turning design mockups into code with deep learning on floydhubs blog within three years deep learning will change front end development it will increase prototyping speed and lower the barrier for building software the field took off last year when tony beltramelli introduced the pix2code paper and airbnb launched sketching interfaces currently the largest barrier to automating front end development is computing power however we can use current deep learning algorithms along with synthesized training data to start exploring artificial front end automation right now in the provided models well teach a neural network how to code a basic html and css website based on a picture of a design mockup well build the neural network in three iterations starting with a hello world version followed by the main neural network layers and ending by training it to generalize a quick overview of the process 1 give a design image to the trained neural network 2 the neural network converts the image into html markup 3 rendered output installation floydhub floydhub is hands down the best option to run models on cloud gpus floydhub com bash pip install floyd cli floyd login git clone https github com emilwallner screenshot to code in keras cd screenshot to code in keras floydhub floyd init projectname floyd run gpu env tensorflow 1 4 data emilwallner datasets imagetocode 2 data data emilwallner datasets html models 1 weights mode jupyter local bash pip install keras pip install tensorflow pip install pillow pip install h5py pip install jupyter git clone https github com emilwallner screenshot to code in keras cd screenshot to code in keras local jupyter notebook go do the desired notebook files that end with ipynb to run the model go to the menu then click on cell run all the final version the bootstrap version is prepared with a small set to test run the model if you want to try it with all the data you need to download the data here https www floydhub com emilwallner datasets imagetocode and specify the correct dir name folder structure bash floydhub folder to run the project on floyhub bootstrap the bootstrap version compiler a compiler to turn the tokens to html css by pix2code hello world the hello world version html the html version resources resources for index file css and images to test index html file html html files to train it on images screenshots for training local local setup bootstrap the bootstrap version compiler a compiler to turn the tokens to html css by pix2code resources eval light 10 test images and markup hello world the hello world version html the html version resources for index file css images and scripts to test index html file html html files to train it on images screenshots for training readme images images for the readme page hello world html bootstrap model weights bootstrap html acknowledgments the code is largely influenced by tony beltramellis pix2code paper code paper the structure and some of the functions are from jason brownlees excellent tutorial
