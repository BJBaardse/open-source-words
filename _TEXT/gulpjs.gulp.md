the streaming build system what is gulp automation gulp is a toolkit that helps you automate painful or time consuming tasks in your development workflow platform agnostic integrations are built into all major ides and people are using gulp with php net node js java and other platforms strong ecosystem use npm modules to do anything you want over 2000 curated plugins for streaming file transformations simple by providing only a minimal api surface gulp is easy to learn and simple to use installation there are a few ways to install gulp v4 0 0 npm install gulp next gulp v4 0 0 alpha 3 npm install gulpjs gulp v4 0 0 alpha 3 gulp v3 9 1 npm install gulp documentation for a getting started guide api docs recipes making a plugin etc check out our docs check out the documentation for v4 0 0 excuse our dust these docs might be behind while we get everything updated please open an issue if something isnt working using the older v3 9 1 check out the documentation at the v3 9 1 tag sample gulpfile js this file will give you a taste of what gulp does js var gulp require gulp var less require gulp less var babel require gulp babel var concat require gulp concat var uglify require gulp uglify var rename require gulp rename var cleancss require gulp clean css var del require del var paths styles src src styles less dest assets styles scripts src src scripts js dest assets scripts not all tasks need to use streams a gulpfile is just another node program and you can use all packages available on npm but it must return either a promise a stream or take a callback and call it function clean you can use multiple globbing patterns as you would with gulp src for example if you are using del 2 0 or above return its promise return del assets define our tasks using plain functions function styles return gulp src paths styles src pipe less pipe cleancss pass in options to the stream pipe rename basename main suffix min pipe gulp dest paths styles dest function scripts return gulp src paths scripts src sourcemaps true pipe babel pipe uglify pipe concat main min js pipe gulp dest paths scripts dest function watch gulp watch paths scripts src scripts gulp watch paths styles src styles you can use commonjs exports module notation to declare tasks exports clean clean exports styles styles exports scripts scripts exports watch watch specify if tasks run in series or parallel using gulp series and gulp parallel var build gulp series clean gulp parallel styles scripts you can still use gulp task to expose tasks gulp task build build define default task that can be called by just running gulp from cli gulp task default build use latest javascript version in your gulpfile node already supports a lot of es2015 to avoid compatibility problem we suggest to install babel and rename your gulpfile js as gulpfile babel js sh npm install save dev babel register babel preset es2015 then create a babelrc file with the preset configuration js presets es2015 and heres the same sample from above written in es2015 js import gulp from gulp import less from gulp less import babel from gulp babel import concat from gulp concat import uglify from gulp uglify import rename from gulp rename import cleancss from gulp clean css import del from del const paths styles src src styles less dest assets styles scripts src src scripts js dest assets scripts for small tasks you can export arrow functions export const clean del assets you can also declare named functions and export them as tasks export function styles return gulp src paths styles src pipe less pipe cleancss pass in options to the stream pipe rename basename main suffix min pipe gulp dest paths styles dest export function scripts return gulp src paths scripts src sourcemaps true pipe babel pipe uglify pipe concat main min js pipe gulp dest paths scripts dest you could even use export as to rename exported tasks function watchfiles gulp watch paths scripts src scripts gulp watch paths styles src styles export watchfiles as watch you can still use gulp task for example to set task names that would otherwise be invalid const build gulp series clean gulp parallel styles scripts gulp task build build export a default task export default build incremental builds you can filter out unchanged files between runs of a task using the gulp src functions since option and gulp lastrun js const paths images src src images jpg jpeg png dest build img function images return gulp src paths images src since gulp lastrun images pipe imagemin optimizationlevel 5 pipe gulp dest paths images dest function watch gulp watch paths images src images task run times are saved in memory and are lost when gulp exits it will only save time during thewatchtask when running theimages task for a second time if you want to compare modification time between files instead we recommend these plugins gulp changed or gulp newer supports many 1 source dest gulp newer example js function images var dest build img return gulp src paths images pipe newer dest pass through newer images only pipe imagemin optimizationlevel 5 pipe gulp dest dest if you cant simply filter out unchanged files but need them in a later phase of the stream we recommend these plugins gulp cached in memory file cache not for operation on sets of files gulp remember pairs nicely with gulp cached gulp remember example js function scripts return gulp src scriptsglob pipe cache scripts only pass through changed files pipe header function do special things to the changed files pipe footer for example add a simple module wrap to each file pipe remember scripts add back all files to the stream pipe concat app js do things that require all files pipe gulp dest public want to contribute anyone can help make this project
