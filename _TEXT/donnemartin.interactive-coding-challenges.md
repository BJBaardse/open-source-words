interactive coding challenges 120 continually updated interactive and test driven coding challenges with anki flashcards challenges focus on algorithms and data structures found in coding interviews each challenge has one or more reference solutions that are fully functional unit tested easy to understand challenges will soon provide on demand incremental hints to help you arrive at the optimal solution notebooks also detail constraints test cases algorithms big o time and space complexities also included are unit tested reference implementations of various data structures and algorithms challenge solutions anki flashcards coding and design the provided anki flashcard deck uses spaced repetition to help you retain key concepts coding deck great for use while on the go design resource the system design primer looking for resources to help you prep for the system design and object oriented design interviews check out the sister repo the system design primer which contains additional anki decks system design deck system design exercises deck object oriented design exercises deck notebook structure each challenge has two notebooks a challenge notebook with unit tests for you to solve and a solution notebook for reference problem statement states the problem to solve constraints describes any constraints or assumptions test cases describes the general and edge test cases that will be evaluated in the unit test algorithm challenge notebook empty refer to the solution notebook algorithm section if you need a hint solution notebook one or more algorithm solution discussions

ipython pip install ipython all as an alternative you can also use the provided requirements txt file pip install r requirements txt for detailed instructions scripts and tools to more optimally set up your development environment check out the dev setup repo for more details on notebook installation follow the directions here more information on ipython jupyter notebooks can be found here nose tests install nose using setuptools distribute easy install nose or pip install nose more information on nose can be found here running challenges notebooks challenges are provided in the form of ipython jupyter notebooks and have been tested with python 2 7 and python 3 x if you need to install ipython jupyter notebook see the notebook installation section this readme contains links to nbviewer which hosts static notebooks of the repos contents to interact with or to modify elements within the dynamic notebooks refer to the instructions below run the notebook of challenges git clone https github com donnemartin interactive coding challenges git cd interactive coding challenges jupyter notebook this will launch your web browser with the list of challenge categories navigate to the challenge notebook you wish to solve run the cells within the challenge notebook cell run all this will result in an expected unit test error solve the challenge and verify it passes the unit test check out the accompanying solution notebook for further discussion to debug your solution with pdb refer to the following ticket note if your solution is different from those listed in the solution notebook consider submitting a pull request so others can benefit from your work review the contributing guidelines for details future development challenges solutions and unit tests are presented in the form of ipython jupyter notebooks notebooks currently contain mostly python solutions tested on both python 2 7 and python 3 x but can be extended to include 40 supported languages repo will be continually updated with new solutions and challenges contributions are welcome contributing contributions are welcome review the contributing guidelines for details on how to submit issues add
