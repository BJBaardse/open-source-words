watch the repository on github follow devdocs on twitter join the mailing list table of contents quick start · vision · app · scraper · commands · contributing · license · questions quick start unless you wish to contribute to the project i recommend using the hosted version at devdocs io its up to date and works offline out of the box devdocs is made of two pieces a ruby scraper that generates the documentation and metadata and a javascript app powered by a small sinatra app devdocs requires ruby 2 5 1 libcurl and a javascript runtime supported by execjs included in os x and windows node js on linux once you have these installed run the following commands git clone https github com freecodecamp devdocs git cd devdocs gem install bundler bundle install bundle exec thor docs download default bundle exec rackup finally point your browser at localhost 9292 the first request will take a few seconds to compile the assets youre all set the thor docs download command is used to download pre generated documentations from devdocss servers e g thor docs download html css you can see the list of available documentations and versions by running thor docs list to update all downloaded documentations run thor docs download installed note there is currently no update mechanism other than git pull origin master to update the code and thor docs download installed to download the latest version of the docs to stay informed about new releases be sure to watch this repository alternatively devdocs may be started as a docker container first build the image git clone https github com freecodecamp devdocs git cd devdocs docker build t thibaut devdocs finally start a devdocs container access http localhost 9292 docker run name devdocs d p 9292 9292 thibaut devdocs vision devdocs aims to make reading and searching reference documentation fast easy and enjoyable the apps main goals are to keep load times as short as possible improve the quality speed and order of search results maximize the use of caching and other performance optimizations maintain a clean and readable user interface be fully functional offline support full keyboard navigation reduce “context switch” by using a consistent typography and design across all documentations reduce clutter by focusing on a specific category of content api reference and indexing only the minimum useful to most developers note devdocs is neither a programming guide nor a search engine all our content is pulled from third party sources and the project doesnt intend to compete with full text search engines its backbone is metadata each piece of content is identified by a unique obvious and short string tutorials guides and other content that dont meet this requirement are outside the scope of the project app the web app is all client side javascript written in coffeescript and powered by a small sinatra sprockets application it relies on files generated by the scraper many of the codes design decisions were driven by the fact that the app uses xhr to load content directly into the main frame this includes stripping the original documents of most of their html markup e g scripts and stylesheets to avoid polluting the main frame and prefixing all css class names with an underscore to prevent conflicts another driving factor is performance and the fact that everything happens in the browser applicationcache which comes with its own set of constraints and localstorage are used to speed up the boot time while memory consumption is kept in check by allowing the user to pick his her own set of documentations the search algorithm is kept simple because it needs to be fast even searching through 100 000 strings devdocs being a developer tool the browser requirements are high on the desktop recent version of chrome firefox or opera safari 8 ie edge 10 on mobile ios 8 android 4 1 windows phone 8 this allows the code to take advantage of the latest dom and html5 apis and make developing devdocs a lot more fun scraper the scraper is responsible for generating the documentation and index files metadata used by the app its written in ruby under the docs module there are currently two kinds of scrapers urlscraper which downloads files via http and filescraper which reads them from the local filesystem they both make copies of html documents recursively following links that match a set of rules and applying all sorts of modifications along the way in addition to building an index of the files and their metadata documents are parsed using nokogiri modifications made to each document include removing content such as the document structure html head etc comments empty nodes etc fixing links e g to remove duplicates replacing all external not scraped urls with their fully qualified counterpart replacing all internal scraped urls with their unqualified and relative counterpart adding content such as a title and link to the original document these modifications are applied via a set of filters using the html pipeline library each scraper includes filters specific to itself one of which is tasked with figuring out the pages metadata the end result is a set of normalized html partials and two json files index offline data because the index files are loaded separately by the app following the users preferences the scraper also creates a json manifest file containing information about the documentations currently available on the system such as their name version update date etc more information about scrapers and filters is available on the wiki available commands the command line interface uses thor to see all commands and options run thor list from the projects root server rackup start the server ctrl c to stop rackup help list server options docs thor docs list list available documentations thor docs download download one or more documentations thor docs manifest create the manifest file used by the app thor docs generate generate scrape a documentation thor docs page generate scrape a documentation page thor docs package package a documentation for use with docs download thor docs clean delete documentation packages console
