numeral js a javascript library for formatting and manipulating numbers website and documentation travis build status master develop npm cdnjs contributing important please create your branch from and submit pull requests to the develop branch all pull requests must include the appropriate tests fork the library install grunt run npm install to install dependencies create a new branch from develop add your tests to the files in tests to test your tests run grunt when all your tests are passing run grunt dist to compile and minify all files submit a pull request to the develop branch formats formats now exist in their own files and act more or less as plugins check out the bytes format for an example of how to create one locales when naming locale files use the iso 639 1 language codes supplemented by iso 3166 1 country codes when necessary locale translations will not be merged without unit tests see the english unit tests for an example changelog 2 0 6 bug fix multi letter currency symbols and spacing added formatting of numbers with leading zeros new format basic point option added scalepercentby100 default true option to turn on off scaling percentages 2 0 4 bug fix
