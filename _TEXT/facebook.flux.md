flux an application architecture for react utilizing a unidirectional data flow getting started start by looking through the guides and examples on github for more resources and api docs check out facebook github io flux how flux works for more information on how flux works check out the flux concepts guide or the in depth overview requirements flux is more of a pattern than a framework and does not have any hard dependencies however we often use eventemitter as a basis for stores and react for our views the one piece of flux not readily available elsewhere is the dispatcher this module along with some other utilities is available here to complete your flux toolbox installing flux flux is available as a npm module so you can add it to your package json file or run npm install flux the dispatcher will be available as flux dispatcher and can be required like this javascript const dispatcher require flux dispatcher take a look at the dispatcher api and some examples flux utils we have also provided some basic utility classes to help get you started with flux these base classes are a solid foundation for a simple flux application but they are not a feature complete framework that will handle all use cases there are many other great flux frameworks out there if these utilities do not fulfill your needs js import reducestore from flux utils class counterstore extends reducestore getinitialstate number return 0 reduce state number action object number switch action type case increment return state 1 case square return state state default return state check out the examples and documentation for more information building flux from a cloned repo clone the repo and navigate into the resulting flux directory then run npm install this will run gulp based build tasks automatically and produce the file flux js which you can then require as a module you could then require the dispatcher like so javascript const dispatcher require path to this directory flux dispatcher the build process also produces de sugared versions of the dispatcher and invariant modules in a lib directory and you can require those modules directly copying them into whatever directory is most convenient for you the flux todomvc and flux chat example applications both do this join the flux community see the contributing file for how to help out license flux is bsd licensed we also provide an additional patent grant
