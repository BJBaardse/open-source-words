icon component its recommended to use pixel sizes that are a multiple of 8 8 16 32 64 etc ion icon font size 64px using the font icon the font icon is compatible with previous versions of ionicons if youre using ionicons for the first time we strongly recommend using the ion icon web component instead an advantage to the font icon file is that all of the icons are in one file a disadvantage to the font icon file is that all of the icons are in one file additionally large font files have a negative impact on a webpages time to first paint in most cases it may be better to request a small number of svgs using the web component method a bonus with the web component is that it uses intersection observer to only request icons which are viewable by the users icons above the fold however if a webpage has to show many icons at once such as this websites homepage which is showing 700 icons on one page the font icon may be a better choice installation to embed the ionicons font icon copy this
