dropzone js is a light weight javascript library that turns an html element into a dropzone this means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it and the file gets uploaded to the server via ajax if you want support please use stackoverflow with the dropzone js tag and not the github issues tracker only post an issue here if you think you discovered a bug or have a feature request please read the contributing guidelines before you start working on dropzone download this is no longer the official repository for dropzone i have switched to gitlab com as the primary location to continue development there are multiple reasons why i am switching from github to gitlab but one of the main reasons are the ridiculous issue tracker that github is providing drowning me in issues that i am unable to categorise or prioritize properly the lack of proper continuous integration and build files i dont want the compiled js files in my repository and people regularly commit changes to the compiled files and create pull requests with them i will write a blog post soon that goes into detail about why i am doing the switch this repository will still remain and always host the most up to date versions of dropzone but only the distribution files mit license
