atlas a powerful android dynamic component framework atlas is an android client side containerization framework we call it android dynamic component framework atlas provides decoupled component and dynamic support atlas covers various issues in the project coding period apk run time and follow up operation and maintenance in the project period atlas enable engineers independent development independent debug because their project were physical isolation in the apk run time atlas has complete component life cycle class isolation and other mechanisms in the operation and maintenance period atlas provide rapid incremental update and rapid upgrade capacity atlas put the work into the project period as much as possible to ensure runtime simple and stable maintenance easy compared with multidex solution atlas not only solved the limitation of the method count 65535 but also clarified the boundary of development provied the powerful capabilities for android development such as parallel iteration rapid development flexible release dynamically update quick fix online failure unlike some android plugin frameworks atlas is a component framework we call it bundle atlas is not a multi process framework you can see there were three main library in this project atlas core atlas update atlas gradle plugin atlas core this is client side core library its job is to install each bundle load the classes and resources on demand when runtime atlas update this is client side update library which provide dexmerge capacity for update or upgrade atlas gradle plugin this is android studio gradle plugin for engineers developing in project period because we change some android default package mechanisms include android aapt atlas aapt use atlas demo doc english 中文 dingtalk im group scan the follow qr code or search group 11727755 using dingtalk 钉钉 app support atlas support all android version from android 4 0 to 8 0 follow is support status runtime android version support dalvik 2 2 not test dalvik 2 3 not test dalvik 3 0 not test dalvik 4 0 4 4 yes art 5 0 yes art 5 1 yes art m yes art n yes art 8 0 yes contributing see atlas contributing guide contributing md for more information no newline at end of file
