hero is a library for building ios view controller transitions it provides a declarative layer on top of the uikits cumbersome transition apis—making custom transitions an easy task for developers hero is similar to keynotes magic move it checks the heroid property on all source and destination views every matched view pair is then automatically transitioned from its old state to its new state hero can also construct animations for unmatched views it is easy to define these animations via the heromodifiers property hero will run these animations alongside the magic move animations all of these animations can be interactively controlled by user gestures at view controller level hero provides several template transitions that you can set through heromodalanimationtype heronavigationanimationtype and herotabbaranimationtype these can be used as the foundation of your custom transitions combine with heroid heromodifiers to make your own unique transitions by default hero provides dynamic duration based on the material design motion guide duration is automatically determined by changes to distance and size—saving you the hassle while providing consistent and delightful animations hero doesnt make any assumptions about how the view is built or structured it wont modify any of your views states other than hiding them during the animation this makes it work with auto layout programmatic layout uicollectionview without modifying its layout object uitableview uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc example gallery checkout the example gallery blog post for a general idea of what you can achieve with hero usage example 1 view controller 1 swift redview hero id ironman blackview hero id batman view controller 2 swift self hero isenabled true redview hero id ironman blackview hero id batman whiteview hero modifiers translate y 100 usage example 2 view controller 1 swift greyview hero id skywalker view controller 2 swift self hero isenabled true greyview hero id skywalker collectionview is the parent view of all red cells collectionview hero modifiers cascade for cell in redcells cell hero modifiers fade scale 0 5 you can do these in the storyboard too documentations checkout the wiki pages usage guide for documentations for more up to date ones please see the header doc use alt click in xcode interactive transition tutorials interactive transitions with hero part 1 faq not able to use hero transition even when self hero isenabled is set to true make sure that you have also enabled self hero isenabled on the navigation controller if you are doing a push pop inside the navigation controller views being covered by another matched view during the transition matched views use global coordinate space while unmatched views use local coordinate space by default local coordinate spaced views might be covered by other global coordinate spaced views to solve this use the useglobalcoordinatespace modifier on the views being covered checkout coordinate space wiki page for details push animation is shown along side my custom animation this is the default animation for navigation controller provided by hero to disable the push animation set self hero navigationanimationtype to fade or none on the navigation controller how do i use a different default animation when dismissing you can use the animation type selectby presenting dismissing to specify a different default animation for dismiss for example swift self hero modalanimationtype selectby presenting zoom dismissing zoomout contribute we welcome any contributions please read the contribution guide
