electron react boilerplate a boilerplate for scalable cross platform desktop apps electron application boilerplate based on react redux react router webpack react transform hmr for rapid application development screenshot install note requires a node version 7 and an npm version 4 if you have installation or compilation issues with this project please see our debugging guide first clone the repo via git bash git clone depth 1 https github com chentsulin electron react boilerplate git your project name and then install dependencies with yarn bash cd your project name yarn note if you cant use yarn run npm install run start the app in the dev environment this starts the renderer process in hot module replacement mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process bash npm run dev alternatively you can run the renderer and main processes separately this way you can restart one process without waiting for the other run these two commands simultaneously in different console tabs bash npm run start renderer dev npm run start main dev packaging to package apps for the local platform bash npm run package to package apps for all platforms first refer to multi platform build for dependencies then bash npm run package all to package apps with options bash npm run package option to run end to end test bash npm run build npm run test e2e bulb you can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the debug prod env variable bash debug prod true npm run package how to add modules to the project you will need to add other modules to this boilerplate depending on the requirements of your project for example you may want to add node postgres to communicate with postgresql database or material ui to reuse react ui components ⚠️ please read the following section before installing any dependencies ⚠️ module structure this boilerplate uses a two package json structure this means you will have two package json files package json in the root of your project app package json inside app folder which package json file to use rule of thumb is all modules go into package json except native modules or modules with native dependencies or peer dependencies native modules or packages with native dependencies should go into app package json if the module is native to a platform like node postgres it should be listed under dependencies in app package json if a module is imported by another module include it in dependencies in package json see this eslint rule examples of such modules are material ui redux form and moment otherwise modules used for building testing and debugging should be included in devdependencies in package json further readings see the wiki page module structure — two package json structure to understand what is native module the rationale behind two package json structure and more for an example app that uses this boilerplate and packages native dependencies see erb sqlite example css modules this boilerplate is configured to use css modules out of the box all css file extensions will use css modules unless it has global css if you need global styles stylesheets with global css will not go through the css modules loader e g app global css if you want to import global css libraries like bootstrap you can just write the following code in global css css import bootstrap dist css bootstrap css sass support if you want to use sass in your app you only need to import sass files instead of css once js import app global scss static type checking this project comes with flow support out of the box you can annotate your code with types get flow errors as eslint errors and get type errors during runtime during development types are completely optional dispatching redux actions from main process see 118 and 108 how to keep your project updated with the boilerplate if your application is a fork from this repo you can add this repo to another git remote sh git remote add upstream https github com chentsulin electron react boilerplate git then use git to merge some latest commits sh git pull upstream master maintainers c t lin jhen jie hong amila welihinda backers support us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities become a backer sponsors become a sponsor and get your logo on our readme on github with a link to your site become a sponsor license mit © c t lin
