tesseract js tesseract js is a javascript library that gets words in almost any language out of images demo tesseract js works with script tags webpack browserify and node js after you install it using it is as simple as javascript tesseract recognize myimage progress function p console log progress p then function result console log result result check out the docs for a full treatment of the api provenance tesseract js wraps an emscripten port of the tesseract ocr engine installation tesseract js works with a script tag via local copy or cdn with webpack and browserify via npm and on node js via npm check out the docs for a full treatment of the api script you can simply include tesseract js with a cdn like this html script src https cdn rawgit com naptha tesseract js 1 0 10 dist tesseract js script after including your scripts the tesseract variable will be defined globally dependency first shell yarn add tesseract js or npm install tesseract js save note tesseract js currently requires node js v6 8 0 or higher usage javascript var tesseract require tesseract js or javascript import tesseract from tesseract js docs tesseract recognize simple example more complicated example tesseract detect imagelike tesseractjob tesseractjob progress tesseractjob then tesseractjob catch tesseractjob finally local installation corepath workerpath langpath contributing development building static files send us a pull request tesseract recognize image imagelike options tesseractjob figures out what words are in image where the words are in image etc note image should be sufficiently high resolution often the same image will get much better results if you upscale it before calling recognize image is any imagelike object options is either absent in which case it is interpreted as eng a string specifing a language short code from the language list or a flat json object that may include properties that override some subset of the default tesseract parameters include a lang property with a value from the list of lang parameters returns a tesseractjob whose then progress catch and finally methods can be used to act on the result simple example javascript tesseract recognize myimage then function result console log result more complicated example javascript if we know our image is of spanish words without the letter e tesseract recognize myimage lang spa tessedit char blacklist e then function result console log result tesseract detect image imagelike tesseractjob figures out what script e g latin chinese the words in image are written in image is any imagelike object returns a tesseractjob whose then progress catch and finally methods can be used to act on the result of the script javascript tesseract detect myimage then function result console log result imagelike the main tesseract js functions take an image parameter which should be something that is like an image whats considered image like differs depending on whether it is being run from the browser or through nodejs on a browser an image can be an img video or canvas element a canvasrenderingcontext2d returned by canvas getcontext 2d a file object from a file input or drag drop event a blob object a imagedata instance an object containing width height and data properties a path or url to an accessible image the image must either be hosted locally or accessible by cors in node js an image can be a path to a local image a buffer instance containing a png or jpeg image a imagedata instance an object containing width height and data properties tesseractjob a tesseractjob is an object returned by a call to recognize or detect its inspired by the es6 promise interface and provides then and catch methods it also provides finally method which will be fired regardless of the job fate one important difference is that these methods return the job itself to enable chaining rather than new typical use is javascript tesseract recognize myimage progress message console log message catch err console error err then result console log result finally resultorerror console log resultorerror which is equivalent to javascript var job1 tesseract recognize myimage job1 progress message console log message job1 catch err console error err job1 then result console log result job1 finally resultorerror console log resultorerror tesseractjob progress callback function tesseractjob sets callback as the function that will be called every time the job progresses callback is a function with the signature callback progress where progress is a json object for example javascript tesseract recognize myimage progress function message console log progress is message the console will show something like javascript progress is loaded lang model eng from cache true progress is initialized with lang eng progress is set variable object progress is set variable object progress is recognized 0 progress is recognized 0 3 progress is recognized 0 6 progress is recognized 0 9 progress is recognized 1 tesseractjob then callback function tesseractjob sets callback as the function that will be called if and when the job successfully completes callback is a function with the signature callback result where result is a json object for example javascript tesseract recognize myimage then function result console log result is result the console will show something like javascript result is blocks array 1 confidence 87 html div class ocr page id page 1 lines array 3 oem default paragraphs array 1 psm single block symbols array 33 text hello world↵from beyond↵the cosmic void↵↵ version 3 04 00 words array 7 tesseractjob catch callback function tesseractjob sets callback as the function that will be called if the job fails callback is a function with the signature callback error where error is a json object tesseractjob finally callback function tesseractjob sets callback as the function that will be called regardless if the job fails or success callback is a function with the signature callback resultorerror where resultorerror is a json object local installation in the browser tesseract js simply provides the api layer internally it opens a webworker to handle requests that worker itself loads code from the emscripten built tesseract js core which itself is hosted on a cdn then it dynamically loads language files hosted on another cdn because of this we recommend loading tesseract js from a cdn but if you really need to have all your files local you can use the tesseract create function which allows you to specify custom paths for workers languages and core javascript window tesseract tesseract create workerpath path to worker js langpath https cdn rawgit com naptha tessdata gh pages 3 02 corepath https cdn rawgit com naptha tesseract js core 0 1 0 index js corepath a string specifying the location of the tesseract js core library with default value https cdn rawgit com naptha tesseract js core master index js set this string before calling tesseract recognize and tesseract detect if you want tesseract js to use a different file workerpath a string specifying the location of the tesseract worker js file set this string before calling tesseract recognize and tesseract detect if you want tesseract js to use a different file langpath a string specifying the location of the tesseract language files with default value https cdn rawgit com naptha tessdata gh pages 3 02 language file urls are calculated according to the formula langpath langcode traineddata gz set this string before calling tesseract recognize and tesseract detect if you want tesseract js to use different language files contributing development to run a development copy of tesseract js first clone this repo shell git clone https github com naptha tesseract js git then cd tesseract js npm install npm start shell cd tesseract js npm install npm start a bunch of npm stuff starting up http server serving available on http 127 0 0 1 7355 http your ip 7355 then open http localhost 7355 examples file input demo html in your favorite browser the devserver automatically rebuilds tesseract js and tesseract worker js when you change files in the src folder building static files after youve cloned the repo and run npm install as described in the development section you can build static library files in the dist folder with shell npm run build send us a pull request thanks
