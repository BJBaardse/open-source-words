kvocontroller key value observing is a particularly useful technique for communicating between layers in a model view controller application kvocontroller builds on cocoas time tested key value observing implementation it offers a simple modern api that is also thread safe benefits include notification using blocks custom actions or nskeyvalueobserving callback no exceptions on observer removal implicit observer removal on controller dealloc thread safety with special guards against observer resurrection – rdar 15985376 for more information on kvo see apples introduction to key value observing usage example apps for ios and os x are included with the project here is one simple usage pattern objective c create kvo controller with observer fbkvocontroller kvocontroller fbkvocontroller controllerwithobserver self self kvocontroller kvocontroller observe clock date property self kvocontroller observe clock keypath date options nskeyvalueobservingoptioninitial nskeyvalueobservingoptionnew block clockview clockview clock clock nsdictionary change update clock view with new value clockview date change nskeyvaluechangenewkey while simple the above example is complete a clock view creates a kvo controller to observe the clock date property a block callback is used to handle initial and change notification unobservation happens implicitly on controller deallocation since a strong reference to the kvocontroller is kept note the observer specified must support weak references the zeroing weak reference guards against notification of a deallocated observer instance nsobject category for an even easier usage just import kvocontroller nsobject fbkvocontroller h for an automatic kvocontroller property on all objects objc self kvocontroller observe clock keypath date options nskeyvalueobservingoptioninitial nskeyvalueobservingoptionnew action selector updateclockwithdatechange swift kvocontroller works great in swift but there are few requirements your observer should subclass nsobject properties that you observe must be marked as dynamic check the following example swift class taskslistviewmodel nsobject dynamic var taskslist tasklist in viewcontroller swift import kvocontroller kvocontroller observe viewmodel keypath listsdidchange options new initial viewcontroller viewmodel change in self taskliststableview reloaddata prerequisites kvocontroller takes advantage of recent objective c runtime advances including arc and weak collections it requires ios 6 or later os x 10 7 or later installation to install using cocoapods add the following to your project podfile ruby pod kvocontroller to install using carthage add the following to your project cartfile github facebook kvocontroller alternatively drag and drop fbkvocontroller h and fbkvocontroller m into your xcode project agreeing to copy files if needed for ios applications you can choose to link against the static library target of the kvocontroller project having installed using cocoapods or carthage add the following to import in objective c objective c import testing the unit tests included use cocoapods for managing dependencies install cocoapods if you havent already done so then at the command line navigate to the root kvocontroller directory and type sh pod install this will install and add test dependencies on ochamcrest and ocmockito re open the xcode kvocontroller workspace and test ⌘u license kvocontroller is released under a bsd license see license file for details
