gotty share your terminal as a web application gotty is a simple command line tool that turns your cli tools into web applications installation download the latest stable binary file from the releases page note that the release marked pre release is built for testing purpose which can include unstable or breaking changes download a release marked latest release for a stabale build files named with darwin amd64 are for mac os x users homebrew installation you can install gotty with homebrew as well sh brew install yudai gotty gotty go get installation development if you have a go language environment you can install gotty with the go get command however this command builds a binary file from the latest master branch which can include unstable or breaking changes gotty requires go1 9 or later sh go get github com yudai gotty usage usage gotty options command arguments run gotty with your preferred command as its arguments e g gotty top by default gotty starts a web server at port 8080 open the url on your web browser and you can see the running command as if it were running on your terminal options address value a value ip address to listen default 0 0 0 0 gotty address port value p value port number to liten default 8080 gotty port permit write w permit clients to write to the tty be careful gotty permit write credential value c value credential for basic authentication ex user pass default disabled gotty credential random url r add a random string to the url gotty random url random url length value random url length default 8 gotty random url length tls t enable tls ssl gotty tls tls crt value tls ssl certificate file path default gotty crt gotty tls crt tls key value tls ssl key file path default gotty key gotty tls key tls ca crt value tls ssl ca certificate file for client certifications default gotty ca crt gotty tls ca crt index value custom index html file gotty index title format value title format of browser window default command hostname gotty title format reconnect enable reconnection gotty reconnect reconnect time value time to reconnect default 10 gotty reconnect time max connection value maximum connection to gotty default 0 gotty max connection once accept only one client and exit on disconnection gotty once timeout value timeout seconds for waiting a client 0 to disable default 0 gotty timeout permit arguments permit clients to send command line arguments in url e g http example com 8080 arg aaa arg bbb gotty permit arguments width value static width of the screen 0 default means dynamically resize default 0 gotty width height value static height of the screen 0 default means dynamically resize default 0 gotty height ws origin value a regular expression that matches origin urls to be accepted by websocket no cross origin requests are acceptable by default gotty ws origin term value terminal name to use on the browser one of xterm or hterm default xterm gotty term close signal value signal sent to the command process when gotty close it default sighup default 1 gotty close signal close timeout value time in seconds to force kill process after client is disconnected default 1 default 1 gotty close timeout config value config file path default gotty gotty config version v print the version config file you can customize default options and your terminal hterm by providing a config file to the gotty command gotty loads a profile file at gotty by default when it exists listen at port 9000 by default port 9000 enable tsl ssl by default enable tls true hterm preferences smaller font and a little bit bluer background color preferences font size 5 background color rgb 16 16 32 see the gotty file in this repository for the list of configuration options security options by default gotty doesnt allow clients to send any keystrokes or commands except terminal window resizing when you want to permit clients to write input to the tty add the w option however accepting input from remote clients is dangerous for most commands when you need interaction with the tty for some reasons consider starting gotty with tmux or gnu screen and run your command on it see sharing with multiple clients section for detail to restrict client access you can use the c option to enable the basic authentication with this option clients need to input the specified username and password to connect to the gotty server note that the credentical will be transmitted between the server and clients in plain text for more strict authentication consider the ssl tls client certificate authentication described below the r option is a little bit casualer way to restrict access with this option gotty generates a random url so that only people who know the url can get access to the server all traffic between the server and clients are not encrypted by default when you send secret information through gotty we strongly recommend you use the t option which enables tls ssl on the session by default gotty loads the crt and key files placed at gotty crt and gotty key you can overwrite these file paths with the tls crt and tls key options when you need to generate a self signed certification file you can use the openssl command sh openssl req x509 nodes days 9999 newkey rsa 2048 keyout gotty key out gotty crt note for safari uses see how to enable self signed certificates for websockets when use self signed certificates for additional security you can use the ssl tls client certificate authentication by providing a ca certificate file to the tls ca crt option this option requires the t or tls to be set this option requires all clients to send valid client certificates that are signed by the specified certification authority sharing with multiple clients gotty starts a new process with the given command when a new client connects to the server this means users cannot share a single terminal with others by default however you can use terminal multiplexers for sharing a single process with multiple clients for example you can start a new tmux session named gotty with top command by the command below sh gotty tmux new a s gotty top this command doesnt allow clients to send keystrokes however you can attach the session from your local terminal and run operations like switching the mode of the top command to connect to the tmux session from your terminal you can use following command sh tmux new a s gotty by using terminal multiplexers you can have the control of your terminal and allow clients to just see your screen quick sharing on tmux to share your current session with others by a shortcut key you can add a line like below to your tmux conf start gotty in a new window with c t bind key c t new window gotty tmux attach t tmux display p s playing with docker when you want to create a jailed environment for each client you can use docker containers like following sh gotty w docker run it rm busybox development you can build a binary using the following commands windows is not supported now go1 9 is required sh install tools go get github com jteeuwen go bindata go get github com tools godep build make to build the frontend part js files and other static files you need npm architecture gotty uses xterm js and hterm to run a javascript based terminal on web browsers gotty itself provides a websocket server that simply relays output from the tty to clients and receives input from clients and forwards it to the tty this hterm websocket idea is inspired by wetty alternatives command line client gotty client if you want to connect to gotty server from your terminal terminal ssh on web browsers secure shell chrome app if you are a chrome user and need a real ssh client on your web browser perhaps the secure shell app is what you want wetty node based web terminal ssh login ttyd c port of gotty with cjk and ime support terminal sharing tmate forked tmux based terminal terminal sharing termshare terminal terminal sharing through a http server tmux tmux itself also supports tty sharing through ssh license the mit license
