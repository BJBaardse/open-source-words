youre not done do this install iterm solarized colors yadr will install solarized colorschemes into your iterm go to profiles colors load presets to pick solarized dark remap caps lock to escape with karabiner elements the escape key is the single most used key in vim old keyboards used to have escape where tab is today apple keyboards are the worst with their tiny esc keys but all this is fixed by remapping caps to escape if youre hitting a small target in the corner you are slowing yourself down considerably and probably damaging your hands with repetitive strain injuries set up a system wide hotkey for iterm keys hotkey recommended cmd escape which is really cmd capslock in iterm uncheck native full screen windows on general this will give you fast full screen windows that are switchable without switching to spaces in macvim uncheck prefer native full screen support under advanced settings same as iterm the native spaces navigation slows everything down for no reason if you want to run vim in terminal make sure you install solarized colorscheme in your terminal if you dont want to use solarized terminal then make sure you do this let g yadr using unsolarized terminal 1 in vimrc before if you want to use an alternate colorcheme like gruvbox then in your vimrc after do let g yadr disable solarized enhancements 1 colorscheme base16 twilight upgrading upgrading is easy

automatically install a few useful packages including ctags git macvim hub and the silver searcher ag note that our autocomplete plugin requires a macvim that supports lua the installer knows how to install it but if you had one installed before you may need to manually remove your old macvim zsh think of zsh as a more awesome bash without having to learn anything new automatic spell correction for your commands syntax highlighting and more weve also provided lots of enhancements vim mode and bash style ctrl r for reverse history finder ctrl x ctrl l to insert output of last command fuzzy

forgot what youve been working on git unstage guns remove from index and git uncommit gunc revert to the time prior to the last commit dangerous if already pushed aliases some sensible default configs such as improving merge messages push only pushes the current branch removing status hints and using mnemonic prefixes in diff i ndex w ork tree c ommit and o bject slightly improved colors for diff gdmb g it d elete m erged b ranches deletes all branches already merged on current branch rubygems a gemrc is included never again type gem install whatever no ri no rdoc no ri no rdoc is done by default tmux configuration tmux conf provides some sane defaults for tmux on mac os like a powerful status bar and vim keybindings you can customize the configuration in tmux conf user vimization of everything the provided inputrc and editrc will turn your various command line tools like mysql and irb into vim prompts theres also an included ctrl r reverse history search feature in editrc very useful in irb postgres command line and etc github issues ghi gem we include the ghi command try ghi list and have fun managing issues from command line vim whats included navigation nerdtree easymotion ctrlp and more text objects manipulate ruby blocks and more code manipulation rails support comments snippets highlighting utils indents paste buffer management lots more general enhancements that dont add new commands a list of some of the most useful commands that yadr provides in vim are included below this is not a comprehensive list to get deeper knowledge practice a few of these every day and then start looking into the lists of plugins above to learn more navigation z go to previous buffer bp x go to next buffer bn cmd j and cmd k to move up and down roughly by functions alt in linux ctrl o old cursor position this is a standard mapping but very useful so included here ctrl i opposite of ctrl o again this is standard search code navigation f instantly find definition of class must have exuberant ctags installed f same as f but in a vertical split gf or ctrl f same as vim normal gf go to file but in a vertical split works with file rb 123 line numbers also gf standard vim mapping here for completeness go to file at line number k search the current word under the cursor and show results in quickfix window k grep the current word up to next exclamation point useful for ruby foo methods cmd highlight all occurrences of current word similar to regular except doesnt move hl toggle search highlight on and off gg or ag grep command line type between quotes uses ag silver searcher after searching with gg you can navigate the results with ctrl x and ctrl z or standard vim cn and cp gd grep def greps for def function name when cursor is over the function name gcf grep current file to find references to the current file clear the search w alias esc or b alias shift esc easymotion a vimperator style tool that highlights jump points on the screen and lets you type to get there mc mark this word for multicursor like sublime use ctrl n next ctrl p prev ctrl x skip to add more cursors then do normal vim things like edit the word gk opens the documentation for the word under the cursor spacebar sneak type two characters to move there in a line kind of like vims f but more accurate gsearch foo global search then do your normal s search replace g and follow up with greplace to replace across all files when done use wall to write all the files file navigation t ctrlp fuzzy file selector b ctrlp buffer selector great for jumping to a file you already have open cmd shift m jump to method ctrlp tag search within current buffer jm jump to models other j mappings jc for controllers jh for helpers etc if you think of a concept and a letter weve got you covered cmd shift n nerdtree toggle alt in linux ctrl \ show current file in nerdtree cmd shift p clear ctrlp cache better keystrokes for common editing commands ctrl space to autocomplete tab for snipmate snippets to surround a word in these common wrappers the does ruby interpolation works in visual mode thanks cj normally these are done with something like ysw cmd cmd cmd cmd etc to change content inside those surrounding marks you dont have to be inside them alt in linux to go to last edit location same as because the apostrophe is hard on the pinky ci to change inside any set of quotes brackets etc tabs windows splits use cmd 1 thru cmd 9 to switch to a specific tab number like iterm and chrome and tabs have been set up to show numbers alt in linux ctrl h l j k to move left right down up between splits this also works between vim and tmux splits thanks to vim tmux navigator q intelligent window killer close window wincmd c if there are multiple windows to same buffer or kill the buffer bwipeout if this is the last window into it vv vertical split ctrl w v ss horizontal split ctrl w s qo open quickfix window this is where output from grep goes qc close quickfix utility ctrl p after pasting use p to paste and ctrl p to cycle through previous pastes provided by yankring yr view the yankring a list of your previous copy commands also you can paste and hit ctrl p for cycling through previous copy commands crs crc cru via abolish vim coerce to snake case camelcase and uppercase there are more help abolish nr narrowrgn use this on a bit of selected text to create a new split with just that text do some work on it then wq it to get the results back ig toggle visual indentation guides cf copy filename of current file full path into system not vi paste buffer cn copy filename of current file name only no path yw yank a word from anywhere within the word so you dont have to go to the beginning of it ow overwrite a word with whatever is in your yank buffer you can be anywhere on the word saves having to visually select it ocf open changed files stolen from garybernhardt open all files with git changes in splits w strip trailing

results ss and sl for the same using spring rspec which makes your rails specs faster by caching the rails env must have spring gem installed vim ruby refactoring try rem rel to extract methods or let statements ctrl s open related spec in a split similar to a and av from rails vim but is also aware of the fast spec dir and faster to type bopen gem name to navigate to a gem tpope vim bundler gcp grep current partial to find references to the current view partial orb outer ruby block takes you one level up from nested blocks great for rspec vim dev vc vim command copies the command under your cursor and executes it in vim great for testing single line changes to vimrc vr vim reload source current file as a vim file extending and overriding yadr settings debugging vim keymappings overriding vim settings with vimrc after and friends adding your own vim plugins testing with docker we can use docker to test some changes in a linux container assuming your host system has docker docker compose properly installed run docker compose run dotfiles this will build the container image it never built it before which may take a while future times will be faster and then run a zsh session inside that container for you there you can play around test commands aliases etc warning this repo is primarly macos oriented so any support for linux can only be done with the help of the community misc credits thanks other recommended macos productivity tools yans blog macos hacks the macos file is a bash script that sets up sensible defaults for devs and power users under macos read through it before running it to use bin macos these hacks are lion centric may not work for other oses my favorite mods include ultra fast key repeat rate now you can scroll super quick using j k no disk image
