 keras deep learning for humans you have just found keras keras is a high level neural networks api written in python and capable of running on top of tensorflow cntk or theano it was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research use keras if you need a deep learning library that allows for easy and fast prototyping through user friendliness modularity and extensibility supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks as well as combinations of the two runs seamlessly on cpu and gpu read the documentation at keras io keras is compatible with python 2 7 3 6 guiding principles user friendliness keras is an api designed for human beings not machines it puts user experience front and center keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load it offers consistent simple apis it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error modularity a model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible in particular neural layers cost functions optimizers initialization schemes activation functions regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models easy extensibility new modules are simple to add as new classes and functions and existing modules provide ample examples to be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness making keras suitable for advanced research work with python no separate models configuration files in a declarative format models are described in python code which is compact easier to debug and allows for ease of extensibility getting started 30 seconds to keras the core data structure of keras is a model a way to organize layers the simplest type of model is the sequential model a linear stack of layers for more complex architectures you should use the keras functional api which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers here is the sequential model python from keras models import sequential model sequential stacking layers is as easy as add python from keras layers import dense model add dense units 64 activation relu input dim 100 model add dense units 10 activation softmax once your model looks good configure its learning process with compile python model compile loss categorical crossentropy optimizer sgd metrics accuracy if you need to you can further configure your optimizer a core principle of keras is to make things reasonably simple while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code python model compile loss keras losses categorical crossentropy optimizer keras optimizers sgd lr 0 01 momentum 0 9 nesterov true you can now iterate on your training data in batches python x train and y train are numpy arrays just like in the scikit learn api model fit x train y train epochs 5 batch size 32 alternatively you can feed batches to your model manually python model train on batch x batch y batch evaluate your performance in one line python loss and metrics model evaluate x test y test batch size 128 or generate predictions on new data python classes model predict x test batch size 128 building a question answering system an image classification model a neural turing machine or any other model is just as fast the ideas behind deep learning are simple so why should their implementation be painful for a more in depth tutorial about keras you can check out getting started with the sequential model getting started with the functional api in the examples folder of the repository you will find more advanced models question answering with memory networks text generation with stacked lstms etc installation before installing keras please install one of its backend engines tensorflow theano or cntk we recommend the tensorflow backend tensorflow installation instructions theano installation instructions cntk installation instructions you may also consider installing the following optional dependencies cudnn recommended if you plan on running keras on gpu hdf5 and h5py required if you plan on saving keras models to disk graphviz and pydot used by visualization utilities to plot model graphs then you can install keras itself there are two ways to install keras install keras from pypi recommended sh sudo pip install keras if you are using a virtualenv you may want to avoid using sudo sh pip install keras alternatively install keras from the github source first clone keras using git sh git clone https github com keras team keras git then cd to the keras folder and run the install command sh cd keras sudo python setup py install configuring your keras backend by default keras will use tensorflow as its tensor manipulation library follow these instructions to configure the keras backend support you can ask questions and join the development discussion on the keras google group on the keras slack channel use this link to request an invitation to the channel you can also post bug reports and feature requests only in github issues make sure to read our guidelines first why this name keras keras κέρας means horn in greek it is a reference to a literary image from ancient greek and latin literature first found in the odyssey where dream spirits oneiroi singular oneiros are divided between those who deceive men with false visions who arrive to earth through a gate of ivory and those who announce a future that will come to pass who arrive through a gate of horn its a play on the words κέρας horn κραίνω fulfill and ἐλέφας ivory ἐλεφαίρομαι deceive keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of project oneiros open ended neuro electronic intelligent robot operating system oneiroi are beyond our unravelling who can be sure what tale they tell not all that men look for comes to pass two gates there are that give passage to fleeting oneiroi one is made of horn one of ivory the oneiroi that pass through sawn ivory are deceitful bearing a message that will not be fulfilled those that come out through polished horn have truth behind them to be accomplished for men who see them homer odyssey 19
