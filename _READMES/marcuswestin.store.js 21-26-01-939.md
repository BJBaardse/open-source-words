com dailymotion com many more store js provides basic key value storage functionality get set remove each as well as a rich set of plug in storages and extra functionality basic usage all you need to get started api installation supported browsers all of them pretty much list of supported browsers plugins additional common functionality list of all plugins using plugins write your own plugin builds choose which build is right for you list of default builds make your own build storages storages provide underlying persistence list of all storages storages limits write your own storage basic usage all you need to know to get started api store js exposes a simple api for cross browser local storage js store current user store set user name marcus get current user store get user remove current user store remove user clear all keys store clearall loop over all stored values store each function value key console log key value installation using npm sh npm i store js example store js usage with npm var store require store store set user name marcus store get user name marcus using script tag first download one of the builds html example store js usage with script tag script src path to my store legacy min js script script store set user name marcus store get user name marcus script supported browsers all of them pretty much to support all browsers including ie 6 ie 7 firefox 4 etc use require store alias for require store dist store legacy or store legacy min js to save some kilobytes but still support all modern browsers use require store dist store modern or store modern min js instead list of supported browsers tested on ie6 tested on ios 8 tested on android 4 tested on firefox 4 tested on chrome 27 tested on safari 5 tested on opera 11 tested on node with https github com coolaj86 node localstorage plugins plugins provide additional common functionality that some users might need list of all plugins all js all the plugins in one handy place defaults js declare default values example usage dump js dump all stored values example usage events js get notified when stored values change example usage expire js expire stored values at a given time example usage observe js observe stored values and their changes example usage operations js useful operations like push shift assign example usage update js update a stored object or create it if null example usage v1 backcompat js full backwards compatibility with store js v1 example usage using plugins with npm js example plugin usage var expireplugin require store plugins expire store addplugin expireplugin if youre using script tags you can either use store everything min js which has all plugins built in or clone this repo to add or modify a build and run make build write your own plugin a store js plugin is a function that returns an object that gets added to the store if any of the plugin functions overrides existing functions the plugin function can still call the original function using the first argument super fn js example plugin that stores a version history of every value var versionhistoryplugin function var historystore this namespace history return set function super fn key value var history historystore get key history push value historystore set key history return super fn gethistory function key return historystore get key store addplugin versionhistoryplugin store set foo bar 1 store set foo bar 2 store gethistory foo bar 1 bar 2 let me know if you need more info on writing plugins for the moment i recommend taking a look at the current plugins good example plugins are plugins defaults plugins expire and plugins events builds choose which build is right for you list of default builds store everything min js all the plugins all the storages source store legacy min js full support for all tested browsers add plugins separately source store modern min js full support for all modern browsers add plugins separately source store v1 backcompat min js full backwards compatibility with store js v1 source make your own build if youre using npm you can create your own build js example custom build usage var engine require store src store engine var storages require store storages localstorage require store storages cookiestorage var plugins require store plugins defaults require store plugins expire var store engine createstore storages plugins store set foo bar new date gettime 3000 using expire plugin to expire in 3 seconds storages store js will pick the best available storage and automatically falls back to the first available storage that works list of all storages all js all the storages in one handy place localstorage js store values in localstorage great for all modern browsers sessionstorage js store values in sessionstorage cookiestorage js store values in cookies useful for safari private mode memorystorage js store values in memory great fallback to ensure store functionality at all times oldff globalstorage js store values in globalstorage only useful for legacy firefox 3 oldie userdatastorage js store values in userdata only useful for legacy ie 6 storages limits each storage has different limits restrictions and overflow behavior on different browser for example android has has a 4 57m localstorage limit in 4 0 a 2 49m limit in 4 1 and a 4 98m limit in 4 2 yeah to simplify things we provide these recommendations to ensure cross browser behavior storage targets recommendations more info all all browsers store 1 million characters except safari private mode all all private mode store 32 thousand characters including safari private mode localstorage modern browsers max 2mb 1m chars limits android sessionstorage modern browsers max 5mb 2m chars limits cookiestorage safari private mode max 4kb 2k chars limits userdatastorage ie5 ie6 ie7 max 64kb 32k chars limits globalstorage firefox 2 5 max 5mb 2m chars limits memorystorage all browsers fallback does not persist across pages write your own storage chances are you wont ever need another storage but if you do see storages for examples two good examples are memorystorage and localstorage basically you just need an object that looks like this js example custom storage var storage name mystorage read function key write function key value each function fn remove function key clearall function var store require store createstore storage
