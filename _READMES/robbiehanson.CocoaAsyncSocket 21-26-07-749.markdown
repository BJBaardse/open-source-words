cocoaasyncsocket cocoaasyncsocket provides easy to use and powerful asynchronous socket libraries for mac and ios the classes are described below installation cocoapods install using cocoapods by adding this line to your podfile ruby use frameworks add this if you are targeting ios 8 or using swift pod cocoaasyncsocket carthage cocoaasyncsocket is carthage compatible to include it add the following line to your cartfile bash github robbiehanson cocoaasyncsocket master the project is currently configured to build for ios tvos and mac after building with carthage the resultant frameworks will be stored in carthage build ios cocoaasyncsocket framework carthage build tvos cocoaasyncsocket framework carthage build mac cocoaasyncsocket framework select the correct framework s and drag it into your project manual you can also include it into your project by adding the source files directly but you should probably be using a dependency manager to keep up to date importing using objective c obj c when using ios 8 frameworks import cocoaasyncsocket or when not using frameworks targeting ios 7 or below import gcdasyncsocket h for tcp import gcdasyncudpsocket h for udp using swift swift import cocoaasyncsocket tcp gcdasyncsocket is a tcp ip socket networking library built atop grand central dispatch here are the key features available native objective c fully self contained in one class no need to muck around with sockets or streams this class handles everything for you full delegate support errors connections read completions write completions progress and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method queued non blocking reads and writes with optional timeouts you tell it what to read or write and it handles everything for you queueing buffering and searching for termination sequences within the stream all handled for you automatically automatic socket acceptance spin up a server socket tell it to accept connections and it will call you with new instances of itself for each connection support for tcp streams over ipv4 and ipv6 automatically connect to ipv4 or ipv6 hosts automatically accept incoming connections over both ipv4 and ipv6 with a single instance of this class no more worrying about multiple sockets support for tls ssl secure your socket with ease using just a single method call available for both client and server sockets fully gcd based and thread safe it runs entirely within its own gcd dispatch queue and is completely thread safe further the delegate methods are all invoked asynchronously onto a dispatch queue of your choosing this means parallel operation of your socket code and your delegate processing code the latest technology performance optimizations internally the library takes advantage of technologies such as kqueues to limit system calls and optimize buffer allocations in other words peak performance udp gcdasyncudpsocket is a udp ip socket networking library built atop grand central dispatch here are the key features available native objective c fully self contained in one class no need to muck around with low level sockets this class handles everything for you full delegate support errors send completions receive completions and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method queued non blocking send and receive operations with optional timeouts you tell it what to send or receive and it handles everything for you queueing buffering waiting and checking errno all handled for you automatically support for ipv4 and ipv6 automatically send recv using ipv4 and or ipv6 no more worrying about multiple sockets fully gcd based and thread safe it runs entirely within its own gcd dispatch queue and is completely thread safe further the delegate methods are all invoked asynchronously onto a dispatch queue of your choosing this means parallel operation of your socket code and your delegate processing code for those new ish to networking its recommended you read the wiki sockets might not work exactly like you think they do still got questions try the cocoaasyncsocket mailing list love the project wanna buy me a ‚òïÔ∏è or a üç∫ üòÄ
