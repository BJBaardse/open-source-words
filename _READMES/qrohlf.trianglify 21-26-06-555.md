trianglify trianglify is a library that i wrote to generate nice svg background images like this one getting trianglify you can grab trianglify with npm recommended npm install trianglify include it in your html via cdnjs html script src https cdnjs cloudflare com ajax libs trianglify 1 1 0 trianglify min js script or clone the repo git clone https github com qrohlf trianglify git quickstart html script src https cdnjs cloudflare com ajax libs trianglify 0 4 0 trianglify min js script script var pattern trianglify width window innerwidth height window innerheight document body appendchild pattern canvas script see https qrohlf com trianglify for interactive examples and a walkthrough of the most commonly used trianglify options licensing the source code of trianglify is licensed under version 3 of the gnu general public license gplv3 this means that any websites apps or other projects that include the trianglify javascript library need to be released under a compatible open source license if you are interested in using trianglify in a closed source project please email qr qrohlf com to purchase a commercial license however its worth noting that you own the copyright to the output image files which you create using trianglify just like you own the copyright to an image created using something like gimp if you just want to use an image file that was generated using trianglify in your project and do not plan to distribute the trianglify source code or compiled versions of it you do not need to worry about the license restrictions described above api trianglify exposes a single function into the global namespace called trianglify this takes a single options object as an argument and returns a pattern object js var trianglify require trianglify only needed in node js var pattern trianglify width 200 height 200 the pattern object contains data about the generated patterns options and geometry as well as rending implementations pattern opts object containing the options used to generate the pattern pattern polys the colors and vertices of the polygons that make up the pattern in the following format js color vertex vertex vertex color vertex vertex vertex pattern svg opts rendering function for svg returns an svgelement dom node takes an optional options object currently the only supported option is includenamespace true which will cause the output to include an xmlns http www w3 org 2000 svg attribute this is helpful if you intend to serialize the svg string to a file as most browsers and vector graphics programs require it see 41 for more details about this option pattern canvas htmlcanvaselement rendering function for canvas when called with no arguments returns a htmlcanvaselement dom node when passed an existing canvas element as an argument renders the pattern to the existing canvas to use this in a node js environment the optional dependency node canvas needs to be installed pattern png rendering function for png returns a data uri with the png data in base64 encoding see examples save as png js for an example of decoding this into a file options trianglify is configured by an options object passed in as the only argument the following option keys are supported width integer defaults to 600 specify the width in pixels of the pattern to generate height integer defaults to 400 specify the height in pixels of the pattern to generate cell size integer defaults to 75 specify the size of the mesh used to generate triangles larger values will result in coarser patterns smaller values will result in finer patterns note that very small values may dramatically increase the runtime of trianglify variance decimal value between 0 and 1 inclusive defaults to 0 75 specify the amount of randomness used when generating triangles seed number or string defaults to null seeds the random number generator to create repeatable patterns when set to null the random number will be seeded with random values from the environment an example usage would be passing in blog post titles as the seed to generate unique trianglify patterns for every post on a blog that wont change when the page reloads x colors string or array of css formatted colors default is random specify the color gradient used on the x axis valid string values are random or the name of a colorbrewer palette i e ylgnbu or rdbu when set to random a gradient will be randomly selected from the colorbrewer library valid array values should specify the color stops in any css format i e 000000 4cafe8 ffffff y colors string or array of css formatted colors default is match x when set to match x the same gradient will be used on both axes otherwise accepts the same options as x colors color space string defaults to lab set the color space used for generating gradients supported values are rgb hsv hsl hsi lab and hcl see this blog post for some background on why this matters color function specify a custom function for coloring triangles defaults to null accepts a function to override the standard gradient coloring that takes the x y coordinates of a triangles centroid as arguments and returns a css formatted color string representing the color that triangle should have here is an example color function that uses the hsl color format to generate a rainbow pattern javascript var colorfunc function x y return hsl math floor math abs xy 360 80 60 var pattern trianglify color function colorfunc stroke width number defaults to 1 51 specify the width of the stroke on triangle shapes in the pattern the default value is the ideal value for eliminating antialiasing artifacts when rendering patterns to a canvas points array of points x y to trianglulate when not specified an array randomised points is generated filling the space
