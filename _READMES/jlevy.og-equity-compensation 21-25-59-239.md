fundamental concepts and terminology around stock stock options and equity compensation compensation your compensation is everything you get for working for a company when you negotiate compensation with a company the elements to think about are cash salary and bonus benefits health insurance retirement perks and equity what we discuss here equity compensation refers to owning stock or having the right to buy stock in a company in general this guide is focused on equity compensation in corporations not limited liability companies the reasons for this are i corporations are the most common form of startup company in the u s llcs are rarely used as the choice of entity for technology startups ii equity compensation for limited liability companies is dramatically different from equity compensation in corporations equity compensation is commonly used for founders executives employees contractors advisors directors and others the purpose of equity compensation is twofold to attract the best talent to align individuals incentives with the interests of the company equity compensation generally consists of stock stock options or restricted stock units rsus in the company well define these concepts next stock stock represents ownership of the company and is measured in shares founders investors employees board members contractors advisors and others may all have stock stock in private companies frequently cannot be sold and may need to be held indefinitely or at least until the company is sold in public companies people can buy and sell stock on exchanges but in private companies like startups usually you cant buy and sell stock easily public and some private companies can pay dividends to shareholders but this is not common among technology startups the total number of outstanding shares reflects how many shares are currently held by all shareholders this number starts at an essentially arbitrary value such as 10 million and thereafter will increase as new shares are issued it may increase or decrease for other reasons too such as stock splits and share buy back if you have stock what ultimately determines its value is percentage ownership of the entire company not the absolute number of shares to determine the percentage of the company a certain number of shares represents divide it by the number of outstanding shares ‚òùÔ∏èüîπ however there are subtleties to be aware of regarding what this outstanding total refers to private companies always have what is referred to as ‚Äúauthorized but unissued‚Äù shares for example a corporation might have 100 million authorized shares but will only have actually issued 10 million shares in this example the corporation would have 90 million authorized but unissued shares when you are trying to determine what percentage a number of shares represents you do not make reference to the authorized but unissued shares you actually want to know the total issued but even this number can be confusing as it can be computed more than one way typically people refer to the total number of shares ‚Äúissued and outstanding‚Äù or ‚Äúfully diluted ‚Äù ‚Äúissued and outstanding‚Äù refers to the number of shares actually issued by the company to shareholders note this will not include shares that others may have an option to purchase ‚Äúfully diluted‚Äù refers to all of the shares that have been issued all of the shares that have been set aside in a stock incentive plan and all of the shares that could be issued if all convertible securities such as outstanding warrants were exercised a key difference is that this total will include all the shares in the employee option pool that are reserved but not yet issued to employees the option pool is discussed more below generally its best to know the fully diluted number to know the likely percentage a number of shares is worth in the future the terminology mentioned here isnt universally applied either so its worth discussing it to be sure there is no miscommunication what is your stock worth it is hard to value private company stock a stock certificate is a piece of paper that entitles you to something of highly uncertain value and could well be worthless in the future or highly valuable depending on the fate of the company üî∏ generally selling stock in a private company may be difficult as the company is not listed on exchanges and in any case there may be restrictions on the stock imposed by the company in startups it is typical to hold the stock until the company is sold or becomes public in an ipo a sale or ipo is often called an exit sales dissolutions and bankruptcy are sometimes called liquidations üîπ private sales in a few cases you may be able to sell private company stock to another private party such as an accredited investor who wants to become an investor in the company but this is fairly rare this is often called the secondary market sales generally require the agreement and cooperation of the company for example typically your shares would be subject to a right of first refusal in favor of the company meaning you couldnt sell your shares to a third party without offering to sell it to the company first another possible roadblock is that private buyers may want the companys internal financials to establish the value of the stock and this typically requires the cooperation of the company there have been some efforts such as sharespost equidate and equityzen to establish a market around such sales particularly for well known pre ipo companies but its still not a routine practice quora has more discussion on this topic kinds of stock stock comes in two main types common stock and preferred stock youll also hear the term founders stock which is usually common stock allocated at a companys formation its complicated but in general preferred stock is stock that has rights preferences and privileges that common stock does not have for example preferred stock usually has a liquidation preference which gives the preferred stock owner the right to be paid before the common stock owners upon liquidation liquidation overhang refers to how much liquidation preference is ahead of the common stock for example if the company has received hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from investors the common stock will not be worth anything on a sale unless the sale price exceeds the liquidation overhang generally employees and service providers receive common stock or options to purchase common stock in return for their service and investors receive preferred stock stock options stock options called ‚Äúemployee stock options‚Äù when given to employees are contracts that allow you to buy shares when you buy shares its called exercising the options options are not the same as stock they are only the right to buy stock upon and subject to the conditions specified in the option agreement stock options allow you to buy shares at a fixed price per share the strike price the strike price is generally set lower often much lower than what people expect will be the future value of the stock which means you can make money when you sell the stock options expire you need to know how long the exercise window will be open options are only exercisable for a fixed period of time typically seven to ten years as long as you are working for the company ‚ùó importantly options can expire after you quit working for the company often the expiration is 90 days after termination of service making the options effectively worthless if you cannot exercise before that point üîπ recently since around 2015 a few companies are finding ways to keep the exercise window open for years after leaving a company and promote this as fairer to employees see this list which includes amplitude clef coinbase pinterest and quora üî∏ vesting stock and stock options may be granted to you but they come with a variety of conditions and limitations one of the most significant conditions is that you usually ‚Äúearn‚Äù rights to the shares or options over time or under certain events this is called vesting vesting usually occurs according to a vesting schedule you vest only while you work for the company for example it is very common to have stock or options vest over a period of four years a bit at a time where none of it is vested at first and all of it is vested after four years vesting schedules can also have a cliff where until you work for a given amount of time you are 0 vested for example if your equity award had a one year cliff and you only worked for the company for 11 months you would not get anything since you have not vested in any part of your award similarly if the company is sold within a year depending on what your paperwork says you may also receive nothing on the sale of the company a very common vesting schedule is vesting over 4 years with a 1 year cliff this means you get 0 vesting for the first 12 months 25 vesting at the 12th month and 1 48th 2 08 more vesting each month until the 48th month for example if you leave just before a year is up you get nothing but if you leave after 3 years you get 75 vesting might also occur in certain situations you may have acceleration where vesting is triggered if a company is sold single trigger or if its sold and youre fired double trigger this is common for founders and not so common for employees grants for advisors typically vest over a shorter period than employee grants often two years advisor grants also typically have a longer exercise window post termination of service typical terms for advisors including equity levels are available from the üì• founder institutes founder advisor standard template fast rsus restricted stock units rsus refer to an agreement by the company to issue you shares of stock or the cash value of shares of stock on a future date each unit represents one share of stock or the cash value of one share of stock that you will receive in the future the date on which you receive the shares or cash payment is the settlement date üî∏ rsus may vest according to a vesting schedule the settlement date may be the time based vesting date or a later date based on for instance the date of a companys ipo both options and rsus are common forms of equity compensation with rsus more common for larger companies and options more common for startups rsus are difficult in a startup or early stage company because when the rsus vest the value of the shares might be significant and taxes will be owed on the receipt of the shares this is not a bad result when the company has sufficient capital to help the employee make the tax payments or the company is a public company that has put in place a program for selling shares to pay the taxes but for cash strapped private startups neither of these are possibilities this is the reason most startups use stock options rather than rsus stock bonuses or stock awards rsus are often considered less preferable to grantees since they remove control over when you owe tax options if granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock are not taxed until exercise an event under the control of the optionee if a company awards you an rsu or restricted stock award which vests over time you will be taxed on the vesting schedule you have been put on ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù with respect to the timing of the tax event this can be a really bad thing if on the date of vesting the shares are worth a lot and consequently you owe a lot of tax ‚òùÔ∏è you dont want to confuse ‚Äúrestricted stock units‚Äù with ‚Äúrestricted stock ‚Äù an entirely different thing described next other equity concepts these are a few different types of equity awards and topics that are less common but we mention for completeness ‚Äúphantom equity‚Äù is a type of compensation award that references equity but does not entitle the recipient to actual equity in the business these awards come under a variety of different monikers but the key to understanding them is knowing that they are really just cash bonus plans where the cash amounts are determined by reference to a companys stock phantom equity can have significant value but may be perceived as less valuable by workers because of the contractual nature of the promises phantom equity plans can be set up as purely discretionary bonus plans which is less attractive than owning a piece of something two examples of phantom equity are phantom stock and stock appreciation rights a phantom stock award entitles you to a payment equal to the value of a share of the companys stock upon the occurrence of certain events stock appreciation rights sar give the recipient the right to receive a payment calculated by reference to the appreciation in the equity of the company warrants are another kind of option to purchase stock generally used in investment transactions for example in a convertible note offering investors may also get a warrant or a law firm may ask for one in exchange for vendor financing as an employee or advisor you may not encounter warrants but its worth knowing they exist they differ from stock options in that they are more abbreviated and stand alone legal documents not granted pursuant to a ‚Äúplan ‚Äù also because they are usually used in the investment context they do not typically include service based vesting provisions or termination at end of service and are valid for a set number of years often 10 years equity compensation details now for the details around how stock and options are used for compensation companies can give equity compensation as stock awards stock options or rsus while the intent of each is similar they differ in many ways particularly around taxation rsus generally dont make sense for early stage companies if companies do grant stock it may be restricted stock in this context ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù refers to the fact that the stock will be subject to repurchase at a lower rate than fair market value or cost and the repurchase right lapses over the service based vesting period typically stock awards are limited to executives or very early hires since once the value of the shares increases the tax burden of receiving them can be too great for most people instead its more common for employees to get stock options üîπ at some point early on generally before the first employees are hired stock will be allocated to a stock option pool a typical size for this is 20 of the stock of the company but it can be 10 15 or other sizes once the pool is established then the companys board of directors grants pieces of it to employees as they join the company often the whole pool is never used the size of the pool is not just about how generous the company is with employees it is determined by complex factors between founders and investors üîπ compensatory stock options come in two flavors incentive stock options isos also called statutory stock options isos are common for employees because they have the possibility of being more favorable from a tax point of view than nsos they can only be granted to employees not independent contractors or directors who are not also employees but isos have a number of limitations and conditions and can also create difficult tax consequences more on this below nonstatutory stock options nsos also called non qualifying stock options or nqos üîπ sometimes to help you lower your tax burden the company makes it possible to early exercise or forward exercise stock options this means you exercise them even before they vest you exercise them and you become a stockholder but the company has the right to repurchase the unvested shares at lower the price you paid or the fair market value of the shares if you quit working for the company the company will typically repurchase the unvested shares should you leave the company before the stock youve purchased vests üî∏ stock options will expire after you leave a company typically after 90 days you might early exercise or exercise at different times during your employment depending on how much it costs and what the tax implications are more on this below companies may impose additional restrictions on stock that is vested for example your shares are very likely subject to a right of first refusal and it can happen that companies reserve the right to repurchase vested shares in certain events tax basics equity compensation awards can give rise to federal and state income taxes as well as employment taxes and medicare surtax charges well first back up and discuss fundamentals of how different kinds of taxes are calculated you must pay federal state and in some cases local taxes on income state tax rates and rules vary significantly state to state since federal rates are much higher than state rates you usually think of federal tax planning first üîπ in general federal tax applies to many kinds of income if youre an employee at a startup you need to consider four kinds of federal tax each of which is computed differently ordinary income tax the tax on your wages or salary income as well as investment income that is ‚Äúshort term ‚Äù employment taxes social security and medicare taxes that are withheld from your paycheck the social security wage withholding rate is 6 2 up to the fica wage base the hospital insurance component is 1 45 and it does not phase out above the fica wage base long term capital gains tax taxes on investment gains that are ‚Äúlong term‚Äù are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income alternative minimum tax amt an entirely different kind of tax that has separate rules and only applies in some situations ordinary income tax applies in the situations youre probably already familiar with where you pay taxes on salaries or wages tax rates are based on filing status if you are single married or support a family and on which income bracket you fall under as of the 2018 tax year there are income brackets at 10 12 22 24 32 35 and 37 marginal tax rates‚Äîsee notice 1036 be sure you understand how these brackets work and what bracket youre likely to be in ‚òùÔ∏è there is sometimes a misconception that if you move to a higher bracket youll make less money what actually happens is when you cross certain thresholds each additional marginal dollar money you make is taxed at a higher rate equal to the bracket youre in it looks roughly like this source investment gains such as buying and selling a stock are similarly taxed at ‚Äúordinary‚Äù rates unless they are long term which means you held the asset for more than a year üì• you also pay a number of other federal taxes see a 2015 summary for all states notably 6 2 for social security on your first 118 500 1 45 for medicare 0 9 additional medicare tax on income over 200 000 single or 250 000 married filing jointly 3 8 net investment income tax on investment income if you make over 200 000 single or 250 000 married filing jointly ordinary federal income tax social security and medicare taxes are withheld from your paycheck by your employer and are called employment taxes üîπ long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income tax 0 15 or 20 this covers cases where you get dividends or sell stock after holding it a year if you are in the middle brackets more than about 37k and less than 413k of ordinary income your long term capital gains rate is 15 more details state long term capital gains rates vary widely california has the highest at 13 3 while other states have none for this reason some people even consider moving to another state if they are likely to have a windfall gain like selling a lot of stock after an ipo alternative minimum tax amt is a complex part of the federal tax code many taxpayers never worry about generally you do not pay unless you have high income 250k or high deductions it also depends on the state youre in since your state taxes can significantly affect your deductions confusingly if you are affected amt tax rates are usually at 26 or 28 marginal tax rate but effectively is 35 for some ranges meaning it is higher than ordinary income tax for some incomes and lower for others amt rules are so complicated you often need professional tax help if they might apply to you the irss amt assistant might also help ‚ùó amt is important to understand because exercising incentive stock options can trigger amt in some cases a lot of amt even when you havent sold the stock and have no money to pay more on this below üîπ section 1202 of the internal revenue code provides a special tax break for qualified small business stock held for more than five years currently this tax break is a 100 exclusion from income for up to 10m in gain there are also special rules that enable you to rollover gain on qualified small business stock you have held for less than five years stock received on the exercise of options can qualify for the section 1202 stock benefit taxes on stock and options now weve covered the basic concepts of equity and taxes here are some messy details of how they interact as already discussed employees can get restricted stock stock options or rsus the tax consequences for each of these is dramatically different 83 b elections generally restricted stock is taxed when it vests as ordinary income of course if the stock is in a startup with low value this may not result in very much tax being owed but if its been years since the stock was first granted and the company is now worth a lot the taxes owed could be significant üîπ however the internal revenue code offers an alternative called a section 83 b election which is an election to be taxed on the receipt of the property even though you might not get to keep it since it has not vested the presumption of the tax law would normally be that you do not owe tax until property you have received vests with a section 83 b election youre telling the irs you want to pay taxes early on stock that is not yet vested instead of paying as it vests the election can potentially reduce your tax significantly if the shares go up in value the taxes owed on vesting might be far greater than the taxes owed at the time of receipt an 83 b election isnt guaranteed to reduce your taxes of course for example the value of the stock may not increase and if you leave the company before you vest you dont get the taxes youve paid back ‚ùó you must file the 83 b election yourself with the irs within 30 days of the grant or exercise or the opportunity is irrevocably lost üî∏ section 83 b elections cannot be made on the receipt of a stock option they can only be made on the receipt of actual shares of stock if you receive an immediately exercisable stock option meaning an option that is early exercisable when it is not vested and you exercise the option before the option vests you can make an 83 b election on your receipt of the shares on exercise section 83 b elections do not apply to vested shares the election only applies to stock that is not yet vested thus if you receive options that are not early exercisable which you cannot exercise until vested then an 83 b election would not apply üîπ founders and very early employees will almost always want to do an 83 b election upon the receipt of unvested shares since the stock value is probably low if the value is really low and the taxes owed are not that great you can make the election without having to pay much tax and start your capital gains holding period on the shares 409a valuations when stock vests or you exercise an option the irs will consider what the fair market value fmv of the stock is when determining the tax you owe of course if no one is buying and selling stock as is the case in most startups then its value isnt obvious for the irs to evaluate how much stock is worth it uses what is known as the 409a valuation of the company the startup pays for an appraisal that sets the 409a typically annually or after events like fundraising in practice this number could be low or high üîπ a company wants the 409a to be low so that employees make more off options but not low enough the irs wont consider it reasonable typically the 409a is much less than what investors pay for preferred stock often it might be only a third of the preferred stock price stock awards vs isos vs nsos startups generally decide to give isos or nsos depending on the legal advice they get its rarely up to you which you get so you need to know about both there are pros and cons of each from both the recipients and the companys perspective üî∏ isos cannot be granted to non employees i e independent contractors ‚ùóüîπ when you owe tax when you get stock options and are considering if and when to exercise them you need to think about the taxes in principle you need to think about taxes 1 at time of grant 2 at time of exercise and 3 at time of sale these events trigger ordinary tax high long term capital gains low or amt possibly high taxes in different ways for nsos and isos the taxes will depend on the gain sometimes called spread between the strike price and the fmv known as the bargain element and the gain on the sale this isnt the whole story but from an employees point of view the key differences are see here here here and here restricted stock awards assuming vesting you pay full taxes early with the 83 b or at vesting at grant if 83 b election filed ordinary tax on fmv none otherwise at vesting none if 83 b election filed ordinary tax on fmv of vested portion otherwise at sale long term capital gains tax on gain if held for 1 year past exercise ordinary tax otherwise including immediate sale nsos you pay full taxes at exercise and the sale is like any investment gain at grant and vesting no tax if granted at fmv at exercise ordinary tax on the bargain element income and employment tax withholding on paycheck at sale long term capital gains tax on gain if held for 1 year past exercise ordinary tax otherwise including immediate sale isos you might pay less tax at exercise but its complicated at grant and vesting no tax if granted at fmv at exercise amt tax event on the bargain element no ordinary or capital gains tax no income or employment tax withholding on paycheck at sale long term capital gains if held for 1 year past exercise and 2 years past grant date ordinary tax otherwise including immediate sale ‚ùó the amt trap if you have received an iso exercising it may unexpectedly trigger a big amt bill‚Äîeven before you actually make any money on a sale to make matters worse you probably cant sell the stock to pay the tax bill this infamous problem more details has trapped many employees and bankrupted people during past dot com busts now more people know about it but its still a significant obstacle to plan around note that if your amt is for events prior to 2008 youre off the hook üîπ if you are granted isos or nsos at a low strike price and the bargain element is zero then you may be able to exercise at a reasonable price without triggering taxes at all so assuming the company allows it it makes sense to early exercise immediately buying most or all of the shares even though theyre not vested yet and simultaneously file an 83 b election üî∏‚òùÔ∏è section 83 b elections are elections to be taxed on the receipt of property even though you might have to forfeit or give back the property to the company you can make an election on the receipt of stock but you cannot make the election on the receipt of an option or an rsu because options and rsus are not considered property for purposes of section 83 b üî∏üå™ isos are often preferred by startups as theyre supposedly better for employees from a tax perspective this assumes that 1 amt wont be triggered and 2 youll get low long term capital gains rate by holding the stock for the appropriate holding periods however often you either run afoul of the amt trap or dont hold the stock long enough with the complicated 1 year 2 year requirement or the spread at exercise is small or zero so the difference wouldnt matter anyway nsos do have a slightly higher tax because of the employment taxes overall its not clear the iso is that much better for employees so many people argue for nsos instead üî∏‚òùÔ∏è even more confusingly isos can make it harder to meet the long term capital gains holding period many people expect early exercise together with an 83 b election will help them hold the stock longer to qualify for long term capital gains while this is true for nsos there is a murky part of the rules on isos that implies that even with an 83 b election the capital gains holding period does not begin until the shares actually vest so if you want to immediately exercise an option and file a section 83 b election and you might have liquidity soon its better if you can have it be an nso taxes on rsus if you are awarded rsus each unit represents one share of stock that you will be given when the units vest üî∏ when you receive your shares you are taxed on their value at that time if you are an employee this means you may have to write a check to the company to cover your income and employment tax withholding often for u s employees companies will withhold the tax in the form of shares such that no action is required by the employee at vesting time if you receive an rsu when the stock is of little value you cannot elect to be taxed on the value of that stock when you receive the rsu‚Äîyou pay taxes at vesting time based on the value of the shares at that time üî∏ there is a combination of big problems for rsus in private companies you will owe tax when you receive the shares even though they are illiquid you cant minimize the impact of an increase in value of the underlying shares between the date you receive the rsu and the date it is settled if you are an employee you will have to write a check to the company to satisfy your income and employment tax withholding üî∏ rsus are less attractive than options from a tax point of view because you cannot make an 83 b election with respect to an rsu by contrast if you receive a stock option as long as it is priced at fair market value you will have no income upon receipt of the options and your income tax and employment tax consequences will be deferred until you exercise an event under your control for the most part taxation summary compare with above at grant no tax at vesting delivery ordinary tax on current share value at sale long term capital gains tax on gain if held for 1 year past exercise ordinary tax otherwise including immediate sale stages of a startup this section is a primer on how companies raise funding and grow as this is critical to understanding the value of a company and what equity in a company is worth the stage of a startup is largely reflected in how much funding it has raised very roughly typical levels are bootstrapped no funding founders are figuring out what to build or theyre starting to build with their own time and resources series seed 250k to 2 million figuring out the product and market series a 2 to 15 million scaling the product and making the business model work series b tens of millions scaling the business series c d e etc tens to hundreds of millions continued scaling of the business üî∏ most startups dont get far very roughly if you look at angel investments more than half of investments fail one in 3 are small successes 1x to 5x returns one in 8 are big successes 5x to 30x and one in 20 are huge successes 30x üî∏ each stage reflects the removal of risk and increased dilution for this reason the equity team members get is higher in the earlier stages starting with founders and increasingly lower as a company matures see the picture above üîπ it is critical to understand risk and dilution to know the possible future value of equity this article from leo polovets a partner at susa ventures gives a good overview üîπ if youre talking with a startup there are a lot of questions to ask in order to assess the state of the companys business startups are understandably careful about sharing financial information so you may not get full answers to all of these but you should at least ask how much money has the company raised including in how many rounds and when what did the last round value the company at will the company likely raise more capital soon how long will the companys current funding last this will likely be given at the current burn rate or how quickly a company is spending its funding so will likely not include calculations for new hires what is the hiring plan how many people over what time frame what is the revenue now if any what are the revenue goals projections where do you see this company in 1 year and 5 years revenue employees market position evaluating equity compensation it takes quite a bit of know how to be able discuss understand and evaluate equity compensation offers if you dont yet have an offer see the sections below on evaluating a company and negotiation we all know the value of cash but determining the value of equity is hard because you have to figure out or make guesses about several things stock value determined by the value the company will have in the future and the number of shares you own vesting and liquidity when you will actually will the shares and when youll be able to sell them tax both the purchase and the sale of stock can require that you pay taxes‚Äîsometimes very large amounts there are several kinds of taxes that apply when you have stock income capital gains and amt üîπ percentage knowing how many shares of stock or stock options you have is meaningless unless you know the number of outstanding shares what matters is the percentage of the company the shares represent typically this number is presented in percent or basis points hundredths of a percent some companies dont volunteer this information unless you specifically ask but its always a fair question since without it the offer of shares is almost meaningless you need to understand the type of stock grant or stock option in detail and what it means for your taxes to know the likely value in some cases high taxes may prevent you from exercising your options and if you cant sell the stock you could effectively be forced to walk away from it if you cant afford to exercise ‚ùó if you do get an offer you need to understand the value of the equity component you need quite a bit of information to figure this out and should just ask if the company trusts you enough to be giving you an offer and still doesnt want to answer these questions about your offer its a warning sign there are many resources out there with more details about questions like this üîπ information that will help you weigh the offer might be what percentage of the company do the shares represent what set of shares was used to compute that percentage is this really the percentage of all shares or some subset what did the last round value the company at i e the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares what is the most recent 409a valuation when was it done and will it be done again soon do you allow early exercise of my options are all employees on the same vesting schedule is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired do you have a policy regarding follow on stock grants does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares finally consider the common scenarios for exercising options discussed below negotiations and offers if you dont yet have an offer its important to negotiate firmly and fairly to get a good one a guide like this cant give you personal advice on what a reasonable offer is as that depends greatly on your skills the marketplace of candidates what other offers you have what the company can pay what other candidates the company has found and the companys needs however this section covers some basics of what to expect with offers and tips on negotiating an offer offers üîπ most companies especially well established ones give roughly equal treatment to candidates but even so sophisticated negotiators can often get better offers many companies will give some flexibility during negotiations letting you indicate whether you prefer higher salary or higher equity candidates with competing offers almost always have more leverage and get better offers salaries at startups are often a bit below what youd get at an established company since early on cash is at a premium for very early stage startups risk is higher offers can be more highly variable and variation among companies will be greater particularly when it comes to equity the dominant factors determining equity are what funding stage a company is at and the role youll play at the company if no funding has been raised large equity may be needed to get early team members to work for very little or for free once significant funding of an a round is in place most people will take typical or moderately discounted salaries startups with seed funding lie somewhere in between typical employee equity levels üîπüå™ there are no hard and fast rules but for post series a startups in silicon valley this table based on the one by babak nivi gives ballpark equity levels that many think are reasonable these would usually be for restricted stock or stock options with a standard 4 year vesting schedule they apply if each of these roles were hired just after an a round and are also being paid a salary so are not founders or employees hired before the a round the upper ranges would be for highly desired candidates with strong track records ceo 5‚Äì10 coo 2‚Äì5 vp 1‚Äì2 independent board member 1 director 0 4‚Äì1 25 lead engineer 0 5‚Äì1 senior engineer 0 33‚Äì0 66 manager or junior engineer 0 2‚Äì0 33 for post series b startups equity numbers would be much lower how much lower will depend significantly on the size of the team and the companys valuation seed funded startups would offer higher equity‚Äîsometimes much higher if there is little funding üîπ one of the best ways to tell what is reasonable for a given company and candidate is to look at offers from companies with similar profiles on angellist leo polovets created a survey of angellist job postings from 2014 an excellent summary of equity levels for the first few dozen hires at these early stage startups for engineers in silicon valley the highest‚Äîthus not typical‚Äîequity levels were hire 1 up to 2 ‚Äì3 hires 2 through 5 up to 1 ‚Äì2 hires 6 and 7 up to 0 5 ‚Äì1 hires 8 through 14 up to 0 4 ‚Äì0 8 hires 15 through 19 up to 0 3 ‚Äì0 7 hires 21 through 27 up to 0 25 ‚Äì0 6 hires 28 through 34 up to 0 25 ‚Äì0 5 keep in mind much of the above information is heavily biased toward early stage silicon valley tech startups not companies as a whole across the country negotiation tips companies will always ask you what you want for compensation and you should always be cautious about answering if you name a number that youll accept you can be fairly sure the company wont exceed it at least not by much some argue that a good tactic in negotiating is to start higher than you will be willing to accept so that the other party can ‚Äúwin‚Äù by negotiating you down a little bit keep in mind this is just a suggested tactic by some and not a hard and fast rule if you are inexperienced and are unsure what a fair offer should look like avoid saying exactly what you want for compensation very early in discussions its common for hiring managers or recruiters to ask this early in the process just to take advantage of candidates that dont have a good sense of their own worth tell them you want to focus on the opportunity as a whole and your ability to contribute before discussing numbers ask them to give you a fair offer once they understand your worth to the company if you are experienced and know your value its often in your interest to state what sort of compensation and role you are looking for to anchor expectations you might even share your expectations early in the process so you dont waste each others time discuss what your compensation might be like in the future no one can promise you future equity salary or bonuses but it should be possible to agree what they will look like if youve demonstrated outstanding performance and the company has money if youre coming from an established company to a startup you may be asked to take a salary cut this is reasonable but its wise to discuss explicitly how much it is and when that will be changed up front for example you might take 25 below your previous salary but there can be an agreement that this will be corrected if your performance is strong and the company gets funding üîπ always negotiate non compensation aspects before agreeing to an offer if you want a specific role title opportunity visa sponsorship special treatment like working from home or have timing constraints about when you can join negotiate these early not late in the process ‚ùó get all agreements in writing if they are not in your offer letter üîπ if youre going to be a very early employee consider asking for a restricted stock grant instead of stock options and a cash bonus equal to the tax on those options this costs the company a little extra paperwork and legal costs but means you wont have to pay to exercise then if you file an 83 b election youre simplifying your situation eliminating the amt issues of isos and maximizing your chances of qualifying for long term capital gains tax getting multiple offers is always in your interest if you have competing offers sharing the competing offers with the company you want to work for can be helpful granted your offers are competitive however dragging out negotiations excessively so you can ‚Äúshop around‚Äù an offer to other companies is considered bad form by some people so its thoughtful to be judicious and timely to the extent that its possible reneging on offers do not accept an offer verbally or in writing unless youre ready to stand by your word in practice people do occasionally accept an offer and then go back on it or renege in the united states this is considered a very bad thing to do especially if it put the company in a difficult position they may have declined another key candidate based on your acceptance and may hurt your reputation in unexpected ways later robby grossman a vp at wistia gives a good overview of equity compensation and negotiation suggestions common scenarios once you have stock options there are several possible scenarios for exercise exercise and hold you can write the company a check and pay any taxes on the spread you are then a stockholder with a stock certificate that may have value in the future as discussed above you may do this early even immediately upon grant before vesting if early exercise is available to you sometime after vesting after leaving the company as long as the exercise window is open üî∏ recall that often the window closes soon after you leave a company generally 90 days after termination wait until acquisition if the company is acquired for a large multiple of the exercise price you may then use your options to buy valuable stock however as discussed your shares could be worth next to nothing unless the sale price exceeds the liquidation overhang since preferred stock is paid out first üî∏ secondary market as discussed above in some cases its possible to exercise and sell the stock in a private company directly to a private party but this generally requires some cooperation from the company and is not something you can always count on cashless exercise in the event of an ipo a broker can allow you to exercise all of your vested options and immediately sell a portion of them into the public market removing the need for cash up front to exercise and pay taxes üîπ note that some of these scenarios may require significant cash up front so it makes sense to do the math early if you are in a tight spot where you may lose valuable options altogether because you dont have the cash to exercise its worth exploring each of the scenarios above or combinations of them such exercising and then selling a portion to pay taxes in addition there are a few funds or individual investors who may be able to front you the cash to exercise or pay taxes in return for an agreement to share profits author and programmer alex maccaw explores a few more detailed scenarios documents and agreements this section covers a few kinds of documents youre likely to see its not exhaustive as titles and details vary when you are considering your offer from the company make sure you have all of the documents you need your offer letter which will detail salary benefits and equity compensation an employee innovations agreement proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement or similar concerning intellectual property if you have equity compensation at some point‚Äîpossibly weeks or months after youve joined‚Äîyou should get a summary of stock grant notice of stock option grant or similar document detailing your grant of stock or options along with all details such as number of shares type of options grant date vesting commencement date and vesting schedule it will come with several other documents which may be exhibits to that agreement stock option agreement stock plan sometimes called a stock option plan or stock award plan or equity incentive plan code section 409a waiver and release sometimes part of the stock option agreement if you are exercising your options you should also see paperwork to assist with that purchase exercise agreement instructions and template for early exercise and 83 b election if applicable end of year tax documents üì• you should receive a form 3921 or 3922 from your company if you exercised iso options during the year compensation gotchas these are scenarios that can be very costly for you if you arent aware of them ‚ùó do not accept an offer of stock or shares without also asking for the exact number of total shares or equivalently getting the exact percentage of the company those shares represent its quite common for some companies to give offers of stock or options and tell you only the number of shares without the percentage the number of shares is meaningless not telling you is a deeply unfair practice a company that refuses to tell you even when youre ready to sign an offer is likely giving you a very poor deal üî∏ if youre looking at an offer work out whether you can and should early exercise and what the cost to exercise and tax will be before accepting the offer ‚ùó if you join a company right as it raises a new round and dont have the chance to exercise right away they may potentially issue you the options with the low strike price but the 409a of the stock will have gone up this means you wont be able to early exercise without a large tax bill in fact it might not be financially feasible for you to exercise at all üî∏ vesting starts on a vesting commencement date sometimes stock option paperwork wont reach you for months after you join a company since it needs to be written by the lawyers and approved by the board of directors this usually isnt a big problem but do discuss it to make sure the vesting commencement date will reflect the true start date of when you joined the company not when the stock option is granted üî∏ if youre going to early exercise consider it like any investment dont believe every projection about the value of the company you hear founders will tell you the best case scenario remember most startups fail do your research and ask others opinions about likely outcomes for the company ‚ùó it may not be common but some companies retain a right to repurchase buy back vested shares its simple enough to ask ‚Äúdoes the company have any repurchase right to vested shares ‚Äù note repurchasing unvested shares that were purchased via early exercise is different and helps you if you dont want to ask the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood skype had a complex controversy related to repurchasing you might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the stock plan itself the stock option agreement the exercise agreement the bylaws the certificate of incorporation or any other stockholder agreement tax gotchas here are some common costly errors to watch out for on the taxation side ‚ùó if you are going to file an 83 b election it must be within 30 days of stock grant or option exercise often law firms will take a while to send you papers so you might only have a week or two if you miss this window it could potentially have giant tax consequences and is essentially an irrevocable mistake‚Äîits one deadline the irs wont extend when you file get documentation from the post office as well as a delivery confirmation and include a self addressed stamped envelope for the irs to send you a return receipt some people are so concerned about this they even ask a friend to go with them to the post office as a witness ‚ùó one of the most serious tax related mistakes you can make is to exercise isos without first knowing the impact on your amt obligations if there is a large spread between strike price and 409a value you are potentially on the hook for a very large tax bill‚Äîeven if you cant sell the stock this has pushed people into bankruptcy it also caused congress to grant a one time forgiveness the odds of that happening again are very low understand this topic and talk to a professional if you exercise isos ‚ùó if you exercise your options and your income had been from consulting rather than employment 1099 not w 2 you will be subject to the self employment tax in addition to income tax self employment taxes consist of both the employer and the employee side of fica this means you will owe the social security tax component 6 2 up to the fica wage base and you will owe the hospital insurance component 2 9 on all of your income üî∏ thoughtfully decide when to exercise options as discussed if you wait until the company is doing really well or when you are leaving the delay can have serious downsides further reading david weekly an introduction to
