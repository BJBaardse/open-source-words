intellij idea community edition these instructions will help you build intellij idea community edition from source code which is the basis for intellij platform development the following conventions will be used to refer to directories on your machine user home is your home directory idea home is the root directory for the intellij source code jdk 16 home is the root directory for the 1 6 jdk which is optional jdk 18 home is the root directory for the 1 8 jdk getting intellij idea community edition source code intellij idea community edition source code is available from github com jetbrains intellij community by either cloning or downloading a zip file based on a branch into idea home the default is the master branch the master branch contains the source code which will be used to create the next major version of intellij idea the branch names and build numbers for older releases of intellij idea can be found on the page of build number ranges if you intend to make open source contributions to the intellij platform see contributing to the intellij project for more information speed tip if the complete repository history isnt needed then using a shallow clone git clone depth 1 will save significant time these git operations can also be done through the intellij idea user interface intellij idea community edition requires additional android modules from separate git repositories to clone these repositories run one of the getplugins scripts located in the idea home directory these scripts clone their respective master branches getplugins sh for linux or mac os getplugins bat for windows note always git checkout the intellij community android and android tools base git repositories to the same branches tags building intellij community edition versions 2017 3 and newer of intellij idea community edition or intellij idea ultimate edition are required to build and develop for the intellij platform opening the intellij source code for build using intellij idea file open select the idea home directory if intellij idea displays an error about a missing or out of date required plugin e g kotlin enable upgrade or install that plugin and restart intellij idea if intellij idea displays and error about a gradle configuration not found refresh the gradle projects intellij build configuration jdk version 1 8 is required for building and developing for intellij idea community edition 1 using intellij idea configure a jsdk named 1 8 pointing to jdk 18 home if not already present add jdk 18 home lib tools jar to the classpath tab for the 1 8 jsdk 2 also configure a jsdk named idea jdk case sensitive pointing to jdk 16 home if you dont want to install jdk 1 6 then you may configure idea jdk to point to jdk 18 home however you must be careful to avoid using java 8 apis in intellij idea community edition modules that use idea jdk if not already present add the corresponding path for tools jar to the classpath for idea jdk jsdk 3 if the maven integration plugin is disabled add the path variable maven repository pointing to user home m2 repository directory 4 speed tip if you have enough ram on your computer configure the compiler settings to enable the compile independent modules in parallel option also set the user local build process vm options to xmx2g these changes will greatly reduce the compile time building the intellij application source code to build intellij idea community edition from source choose build build project from the main menu to build installation packages run the ant command in idea home directory see the build xml file for details running intellij idea to run the intellij idea built from source choose run run from the main menu this will use the preconfigured run configuration idea to run tests on the build apply these setting to the run edit run configurations defaults junit configuration tab working dir idea home bin vm options ea djava system class loader com intellij util lang urlclassloader didea config path test config didea system path test system you can find other helpful information at http www jetbrains org the contribute section of that site describes how you can contribute to intellij idea
