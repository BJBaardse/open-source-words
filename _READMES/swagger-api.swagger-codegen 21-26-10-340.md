swagger swagger codegen cli 2 3 1 swagger codegen cli 2 3 1 jar on a mac its even easier with brew sh brew install swagger codegen to build from source you need the following installed and available in your path java 7 or 8 apache maven 3 3 3 or greater os x users dont forget to install java 7 or 8 you probably have 1 6 export java home in order to use the supported java version sh export java home usr libexec java home v 1 8 export path java home bin path building after cloning the project you can build it from source with this command sh mvn clean package if you dont have maven installed you may directly use the included maven wrapper and build with the command sh mvnw clean package homebrew to install run brew install swagger codegen here is an example usage sh swagger codegen generate i http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json l ruby o tmp test docker development in docker you can use run in docker sh to do all development this script maps your local repository to gen in the docker container it also maps m2 repository to the appropriate container location to execute mvn package sh git clone https github com swagger api swagger codegen cd swagger codegen run in docker sh mvn package build artifacts are now accessible in your working directory once built run in docker sh will act as an executable for swagger codegen cli to generate code youll need to output to a

codegen cli official cli swagger generator docker image the swagger generator image can act as a self hosted web application and api for generating code this container can be incorporated into a ci pipeline and requires at least two http requests and some docker orchestration to access generated code example usage note this assumes jq is installed for command line processing of json sh start container and save the container id cid docker run d swaggerapi swagger generator allow for startup sleep 5 get the ip of the running container gen ip docker inspect format networksettings ipaddress

in the example above result zip will contain the generated client swagger codegen cli docker image the swagger codegen image acts as a standalone executable it can be used as an alternative to installing via homebrew or for developers who are unable to install java or upgrade the installed version to generate code with this image youll need to mount a local location as a volume example sh docker run rm v pwd local swaggerapi swagger codegen cli generate \ i http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json \ l go \ o local out go the generated code will be located under out go in the current

package other languages have petstore samples too sh bin android petstore sh bin java petstore sh bin objc petstore sh generating libraries from your server its just as easy just use the i flag to point to either a server or file modifying the client library format dont like the default swagger client syntax want a different language supported no problem swagger codegen processes mustache templates with the jmustache engine you can modify our templates or make your own you can look at modules swagger codegen src main resources your language for examples to make your own templates create your own files and use the t flag to specify your template folder it actually is that easy making your own codegen modules if youre starting a project with a new language and dont see what you need swagger codegen can help you create a project to generate your own libraries sh java jar modules swagger codegen cli target swagger codegen cli jar meta \ o output mylibrary n myclientcodegen p com my company codegen this will write in the folder output mylibrary all the files you need to get started including a readme md once modified and compiled you can load your library with the codegen and generate clients with your own custom rolled logic you would then compile your library in the output mylibrary folder with mvn package and execute the codegen like such sh java cp output mylibrary

library its completely dynamic and doesnt require static code generation there is a third party component called swagger js codegen that can generate angularjs or nodejs source code from a openapi specification exclamation on dec 7th 2015 a javascript api client generator has been added by jfiala generating a client from local files if you dont want to call your server you can save the openapi spec files into a directory and pass an argument to the code generator like this i modules swagger codegen src test resources 2 0 petstore json great for creating libraries on your ci server from the swagger editor or while coding on an airplane selective generation you may not want to generate all models in your project likewise you may want just one or two apis to be written if thats the case you can use system properties to control the output the default is generate everything supported by the specific library once you enable a feature it will restrict the contents generated sh generate only models java dmodels opts generate only apis java dapis opts generate only supporting files java dsupportingfiles generate models and supporting files java dmodels dsupportingfiles to control the specific files being generated you can pass a csv list of what you want sh generate the user and pet models only dmodels user pet generate the user model and the supportingfile stringutil java dmodels user dsupportingfiles stringutil java to control generation of docs and tests for api and models pass false to the option for api these options are dapitests false and dapidocs false for models dmodeltests false and dmodeldocs false these options default to true and dont limit the generation of the feature options listed above like dapi sh generate only models with tests and documentation java dmodels opts generate only models with tests but no documentation java dmodels dmodeldocs false opts generate only user and pet models no tests and no documentation java dmodels user pet dmodeltests false opts generate only apis without tests java dapis dapitests false opts generate only apis modeltests option is ignored java dapis dmodeltests false opts when using selective generation only the templates needed for the specific generation will be used ignore file format swagger codegen supports a swagger codegen ignore file similar to gitignore or dockerignore youre probably already familiar with the ignore file allows for better control over overwriting existing files than the skip overwrite flag with the ignore file you can specify individual files or directories can be ignored this can be useful for example if you only want a subset of the generated code examples sh swagger codegen ignore lines beginning with a are comments this should match build sh located anywhere build sh matches build sh in the root build sh exclude all recursively docs explicitly allow files excluded by other rules docs userapi md recursively exclude directories named api you cant negate files below this directory src api when this file is nested under api excluded above this rule is ignored because parent directory is excluded by previous rule src petapitests cs exclude a single nested file explicitly src io swagger test model animalfarmtests cs the swagger codegen ignore file must exist in the root of the output directory upon first code generation you may also pass the cli option ignore file override path to ignore file for greater control over generated outputs note that this is a complete override and will override the swagger codegen ignore file in an output directory when regenerating code editor support for swagger codegen ignore files is available in intellij via the ignore plugin customizing the generator there are different aspects of customizing the code generator beyond just creating or modifying templates each language has a supporting configuration file to handle different type mappings etc sh ls 1 modules swagger codegen src main java io swagger codegen languages abstractjavajaxrsservercodegen java abstracttypescriptclientcodegen java results omitted typescriptangularclientcodegen java typescriptnodeclientcodegen java each of these files creates reasonable defaults so you can get running quickly but if you want to configure package names prefixes model folders etc you can use a json config file to pass the values sh java jar modules swagger codegen cli target swagger codegen cli jar generate \ i http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json \ l java \ o samples client petstore java \ c path to config json and config json contains the following as an example json apipackage petstore supported config options can be different per language running config help l lang will show available options these options are applied via configuration file e g config json or by passing them with d optionname optionvalue if d optionname does not work please open a ticket and well look into it sh java jar modules swagger

another way to override default options is to extend the config class for the specific language to change for example the prefix for the objective c generated files simply subclass the objcclientcodegen java java package com mycompany swagger codegen import io swagger codegen languages public class myobjccodegen extends objcclientcodegen static prefix helo and specify the classname when running the generator l com mycompany swagger codegen myobjccodegen your subclass will now be loaded and overrides the prefix value in the superclass bringing your own models sometimes you dont want a model generated in this case you can simply specify an import mapping to tell the codegen what not to create when doing this every location that references a specific model will refer back to your classes note this may not apply to all languages to specify an import mapping use the import mappings argument and specify the model to import logic as such import mappings pet my models mypet or for multiple mappings import mappings pet my models mypet order my models myorder or import mappings pet my models mypet import mappings order my models myorder validating your openapi spec you have options the easiest is to use our online validator which not only will let you validate your spec but with the debug flag you can see whats wrong with your spec for example http online swagger io validator debug url http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json generating dynamic html api documentation to do so just use the l dynamic html flag when reading a spec file this creates html documentation that is available as a single page application with ajax to view the documentation sh cd samples dynamic html npm install node which launches a node js server so the ajax calls have a place to go generating static html api documentation to do so just use the l html flag when reading a spec file this creates a single simple html file with embedded css so you can ship it as an email attachment or load it from your filesystem sh cd samples html open index html to build a server stub please refer to https github com swagger api swagger codegen wiki server stub generator howto for more information to build the codegen library this will create the swagger codegen library from source sh mvn package note the templates are included in the library generated if you want to modify the templates youll need to either repackage the library or specify a path to your scripts workflow integration maven integration you can use the swagger codegen maven plugin for integrating with your workflow and generating any codegen target gradle integration gradle swagger generator plugin is available for generating source code and api document github integration to push the auto generated sdk to github we provide git push sh to streamline the process for example 1 create a new repository in github ref https help github com articles creating a new repository 2 generate the sdk sh java jar modules swagger codegen cli target swagger codegen cli jar generate \ i modules swagger codegen src test resources 2 0 petstore json l perl \ git user id swaggerapi \ git repo id petstore perl \ release note github integration demo \ o var tmp perl petstore 3 push the sdk to github sh cd var tmp perl petstore bin sh git push sh online generators one can also generate api client or server using the online generators https generator swagger io for example to generate ruby api client simply send the following http request using curl sh curl x post h content type application json d swaggerurl http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json https generator swagger io api gen clients ruby then you will receieve a json response with the url to download the zipped code to customize the sdk you can post to https generator swagger io gen clients language with the following http body json options swaggerurl http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json in which the options for a language can be obtained by submitting a get request to https generator swagger io api gen clients language for example curl https generator swagger io api gen clients python returns json packagename opt packagename description python package name convention snake case type string default swagger client packageversion opt packageversion description python package version type string default 1 0 0 sortparamsbyrequiredflag opt sortparamsbyrequiredflag description sort method arguments to place required parameters before optional parameters type boolean default true to set package name to pet store the http body of the request is as follows json options packagename pet store swaggerurl http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json and here is the curl command sh curl h content type application json x post d options packagename pet store swaggerurl http petstore swagger io v2 swagger json https generator swagger io api gen clients python instead of using swaggerurl with an url to the openapi swagger spec one can include the spec in the json payload with spec e g json options spec swagger 2 0 info version 1 0 0 title test api guidelines for contribution please refer to this page companies
