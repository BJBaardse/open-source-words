parse server is an open source version of the parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run node js parse server works with the express web application framework it can be added to existing web applications or run by itself getting started running parse server locally docker saving an object connect an sdk running elsewhere sample application parse server express logging documentation configuration basic options client key options advanced options logging email verification password reset using environment variables available adapters configuring file adapters support ride the bleeding edge contributing backers sponsors getting started april 2016 we created a series of video screencasts please check them out here http blog parseplatform org learn parse server video series april 2016 the fastest and easiest way to get started is to run mongodb and parse server locally running parse server locally npm install g parse server mongodb runner mongodb runner start parse server appid application id masterkey master key databaseuri mongodb localhost test note if installation with g fails due to permission problems npm err code eacces please refer to this link inside a docker container docker build tag parse server docker run name my mongo d mongo docker run name my parse server link my mongo mongo d parse server appid application id masterkey master key databaseuri mongodb mongo test you can use any arbitrary string as your application id and master key these will be used by your clients to authenticate with the parse server thats it you are now running a standalone version of parse server on your machine using a remote mongodb pass the databaseuri database uri parameter when starting parse server learn more about configuring parse server here for a full list of available options run parse server help saving your first object now that youre running parse server it is time to save your first object well use the rest api but you can easily do the same using any of the parse sdks run the following bash curl x post \ h x parse application id application id \ h content type application json \ d score 1337 playername sean plott cheatmode false \ http localhost 1337 parse classes gamescore you should get a response similar to this js objectid 2ntvsprgik createdat 2016 03 11t23 51 48 050z you can now retrieve this object directly make sure to replace 2ntvsprgik with the actual objectid you received when the object was created bash curl x get \ h x parse application id application id \ http localhost 1337 parse classes gamescore 2ntvsprgik json response objectid 2ntvsprgik score 1337 playername sean plott cheatmode false updatedat 2016 03 11t23 51 48 050z createdat 2016 03 11t23 51 48 050z keeping tracks of individual object ids is not ideal however in most cases you will want to run a query over the collection like so curl x get \ h x parse application id application id \ http localhost 1337 parse classes gamescore json the response will provide all the matching objects within theresults array results objectid 2ntvsprgik score 1337 playername sean plott cheatmode false updatedat 2016 03 11t23

sdks for all the major platforms refer to the parse server guide to learn how to connect your app to parse server running parse server elsewhere once you have a better understanding of how the project works please refer to the parse server wiki for in depth guides to deploy parse server to major infrastructure providers read on to learn more about additional ways of running parse server parse server sample application we have provided a basic node js application that uses the parse server module on express and can be easily deployed to various infrastructure providers heroku and mlab aws and elastic beanstalk google app engine microsoft azure sashido digital ocean pivotal web services back4app gomix flynn parse server express you can also create an instance of parse server and mount it on a new or existing express website js var express require express var parseserver require parse server parseserver var app express var api new parseserver databaseuri mongodb localhost 27017 dev

masterkey master key documentation the full documentation for parse server is available in the wiki the parse server guide is a good place to get started if youre interested in developing for parse server the development guide will help you get set up configuration parse server can be configured using the following options you may pass these as parameters when running a standalone parse server or by loading a configuration file in json format using parse server path to configuration json if youre using parse server on express you may also pass these to the parseserver object as options for the full list of available options run parse server help basic options appid required the application id to host with this server instance you can use any arbitrary string for migrated apps this should match your hosted parse app masterkey required the master key to use for overriding acl security you can use any arbitrary string keep it secret for migrated apps this should match your hosted parse app databaseuri required the connection string for your database i e mongodb user pass host com dbname be sure to url encode your password if your password has special characters port the default port is 1337 specify this parameter to use a different port serverurl url to your parse server dont forget to specify http or https this url will be used when making requests to parse server

with parse are no longer necessary with parse server if you wish to still require them perhaps to be able to refuse access to older clients you can set the keys at initialization time setting any of

server mandrill adapter parse server simple ses adapter parse server mailgun adapter template parse server sendinblue adapter parse server mailjet adapter simple parse smtp adapter parse server generic email adapter using environment variables to configure parse server you may configure the parse server using environment variables bash port parse server application id parse server master key parse server database uri parse server url parse server cloud the default port is 1337 to use a different port set the port environment variable bash port 8080 parse server appid application id masterkey master key for the full list of configurable environment variables run parse server help available adapters all official adapters are distributed as scoped pacakges on npm parse some well maintained adapters are also available on the parse server modules organization you can also find more adapters maintained by the community by searching on npm configuring file adapters parse server allows developers to choose from several options when hosting files gridstoreadapter which is backed by mongodb s3adapter which is backed by amazon s3 or gcsadapter which is backed by google cloud storage gridstoreadapter is used by default and requires no setup but if youre interested in using s3 or google cloud storage additional configuration information is available in the parse server guide support for implementation related questions or technical support please refer to the stack overflow and server fault communities if you believe youve found an issue with parse server make sure these boxes are checked before reporting an issue youve met the prerequisites youre running the latest version of parse server youve searched through existing issues chances are that your issue has been reported or resolved before want to ride the bleeding edge it is recommend to use builds deployed npm for many reasons but if you want to use the latest not yet released version of parse server you can do so by depending directly on this branch npm install parse community parse server git master experimenting you can also use your own forks and work in progress branches by specifying them npm install github myusername parse server my awesome feature and dont forget if you plan to deploy it remotely you should run npm install with the save option contributing we really want parse to be yours to see it grow and thrive in the open source community please see the contributing to parse server guide as of april 5 2017 parse llc has transferred this code to the parse community organization and will no longer be contributing to or distributing this code backers support us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities become a backer sponsors become a sponsor
