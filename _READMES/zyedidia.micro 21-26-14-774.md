micro is a terminal based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals it comes as one single batteries included static binary with no dependencies and you can download and use it right now as the name indicates micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch but micro also aims to be enjoyable to use full time whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it like me or because you need to over ssh here is a picture of micro editing its source code to see more screenshots of micro showcasing all of the default colorschemes see here you can also check out the website for micro at https micro editor github io table of contents features

keybindings extremely good mouse support this means mouse dragging to create a selection double click to select by word and triple click to select by line cross platform it should work on all the

features such as autocompletion 174 or a tree view 249 in the future installation to install micro you can download a prebuilt binary or you can build it from source if you want more information about ways to install micro see this wiki page prebuilt binaries all you need to install micro is one file the binary itself its as simple as that download the binary from the releases page on that page youll see the nightly release which contains binaries for micro which are built every night and youll see all the stable releases with the corresponding binaries if youd like to see more information after installing micro run micro version installation script there is a great script which can install micro for you by downloading the latest prebuilt binary you can find it at https getmic ro the github repo for it is here then you can easily install micro curl https getmic ro bash the script will install the micro binary to the current directory see the github page for more information package managers you can install micro using homebrew on mac brew install micro on windows you can install micro through chocolatey or scoop choco install micro or scoop install micro on linux you can install micro through snap snap install micro classic on openbsd micro is available in the ports tree it is also available as a binary package pkg add v micro building from source if your operating system does not have a binary release but does run go you can build from source make sure that you have go version 1 5 or greater go 1 4 will work if your version supports cgo and that your gopath env variable is set i recommend setting it to go if you dont have one go get d github com zyedidia micro cmd micro cd gopath src github com zyedidia micro make install the binary will then be installed to gopath bin or your gobin please make sure that when you are working with micros code you are working on your gopath you can install directly with go get go get u github com zyedidia micro cmd micro but this isnt recommended because it doesnt build micro with version information which is useful for the plugin manager macos terminal if you are using macos you should consider using iterm2 instead of the default mac terminal the iterm2 terminal has much better mouse support as well as better handling of key events for best keybinding behavior choose xterm defaults under preferences profiles keys load preset the newest versions also support true color linux clipboard support on linux clipboard support requires the xclip or xsel commands to be installed for ubuntu sh sudo apt get install xclip if you dont have xclip or xsel micro will use an internal clipboard for copy and paste but it wont work with external applications colors and syntax highlighting if you open micro and it doesnt seem like syntax highlighting is working this is probably because you are using a terminal which does not support 256 color try changing the colorscheme to simple by pressing ctrle in micro and typing set colorscheme simple if you are using the default ubuntu terminal to enable 256 make sure your term variable is set to xterm 256color many of the windows terminals dont support more than 16 colors which means that micros default colorscheme wont look very good you can either set the colorscheme to simple or download a better terminal emulator like mintty plan9 cygwin please note that micro uses the amazing tcell library but this means that micro is restricted to the platforms tcell supports as a result micro does not support plan9 and cygwin although this may change in the future micro also doesnt support nacl but nacl is deprecated anyways usage once you have built the editor simply start it by running micro path to file txt or simply micro to open an empty buffer micro also supports creating buffers from stdin sh ifconfig micro you can move the cursor around with the arrow keys and mouse you can also use the mouse to manipulate the text simply clicking and dragging will select text you can also double click to enable word selection and triple click to enable line selection documentation and help micro has a built in help system which you can access by pressing ctrl e and typing help additionally you can view the help files here main help keybindings commands colors options plugins i also recommend reading the tutorial for a brief introduction to the more powerful configuration features micro offers contributing if you find any bugs please report them i am also happy to accept pull requests from anyone you can use the github issue tracker to report bugs ask questions or suggest new features for a more informal setting to discuss the editor you can join the gitter chat
