svprogresshud svprogresshud is a clean and easy to use hud meant to display the progress of an ongoing task on ios and tvos demo try svprogresshud on appetize io installation from cocoapods cocoapods is a dependency manager for objective c which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd party libraries like svprogresshud in your projects first add the following line to your podfile ruby pod svprogresshud if you want to use the latest features of svprogresshud use normal external source dependencies ruby pod svprogresshud git https github com svprogresshud svprogresshud git this pulls from the master branch directly second install svprogresshud into your project ruby pod install carthage carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks to integrate svprogresshud into your xcode project using carthage specify it in your cartfile ogdl github svprogresshud svprogresshud run carthage bootstrap to build the framework in your repositorys carthage directory you can then include it in your targets carthage copy frameworks build phase for more information on this please see carthages documentation manually drag the svprogresshud svprogresshud folder into your project take care that svprogresshud bundle is added to targets build phases copy bundle resources add the quartzcore framework to your project swift even though svprogresshud is written in objective c it can be used in swift with no hassle if you use cocoapods add the following line to your podfile ruby use frameworks if you added svprogresshud manually just add a bridging header file to your project with the svprogresshud header included usage see sample xcode project in demo svprogresshud is created as a singleton i e it doesnt need to be explicitly allocated and instantiated you directly call svprogresshud method use svprogresshud wisely only use it if you absolutely need to perform a task before taking the user forward bad use case examples pull to refresh infinite scrolling sending message using svprogresshud in your app will usually look as simple as this using grand central dispatch objective c svprogresshud show dispatch async dispatch get global queue dispatch queue priority default 0 time consuming task dispatch async dispatch get main queue svprogresshud dismiss showing the hud you can show the status of indeterminate tasks using one of the following objective c void show void showwithstatus nsstring string if youd like the hud to reflect the progress of a task use one of these objective c void showprogress cgfloat progress void showprogress cgfloat progress status nsstring status dismissing the hud the hud can be dismissed using objective c void dismiss void dismisswithdelay nstimeinterval delay if youd like to stack huds you can balance out every show call using void popactivity the hud will get dismissed once the popactivity calls will match the number of show calls or show a confirmation glyph before before getting dismissed a little bit later the display time depends on minimumdismisstimeinterval and the length of the given string objective c void showinfowithstatus nsstring string void showsuccesswithstatus nsstring string void showerrorwithstatus nsstring string void showimage uiimage image status nsstring string customization svprogresshud can be customized via the following methods objective c void setdefaultstyle svprogresshudstyle style default is svprogresshudstylelight void setdefaultmasktype svprogresshudmasktype masktype default

methods hint as standard svprogresshud offers two preconfigured styles svprogresshudstylelight white background with black spinner and text svprogresshudstyledark black background with white spinner and text if you want to use custom colors use setforegroundcolor and setbackgroundcolor these implicitly set the huds style to svprogresshudstylecustom haptic feedback for users with newer devices starting with the iphone 7 svprogresshud can automatically trigger haptic feedback depending on which hud is being displayed the feedback maps as follows showsuccesswithstatus uinotificationfeedbacktypesuccess showinfowithstatus uinotificationfeedbacktypewarning showerrorwithstatus uinotificationfeedbacktypeerror to enable this functionality use sethapticsenabled users with devices prior to iphone 7 will have no change in functionality notifications svprogresshud posts four notifications via nsnotificationcenter in response to being shown dismissed svprogresshudwillappearnotification when the show animation starts svprogresshuddidappearnotification when the show animation completes svprogresshudwilldisappearnotification when the dismiss animation starts svprogresshuddiddisappearnotification when the dismiss animation completes each notification passes a userinfo dictionary holding the huds status string if any retrievable via svprogresshudstatususerinfokey svprogresshud also posts svprogresshuddidreceivetoucheventnotification when users touch on the overall screen or svprogresshuddidtouchdowninsidenotification when a user touches on the hud directly for this notifications userinfo is not passed but the object parameter contains the uievent that related to the touch app extensions when using svprogresshud in an app extension define sv app extensions to avoid using unavailable apis additionally call setviewforextension from your extensions view controller with self view contributing to this project if you have
