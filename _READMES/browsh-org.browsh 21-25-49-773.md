a fully interactive realtime and modern text based browser rendered to ttys and browsers why not all the world has good internet if all you have is a 3kbps connection tethered from a phone then its good to ssh into a server and browse the web through say elinks that way the server downloads the web pages and uses the limited bandwidth of an ssh connection to display the result but traditional text based browsers lack js support and all that other modern html5 goodness browsh is different in that its backed by a real browser namely headless firefox and uses that to create purely text based version of web pages and web apps that can be easily rendered in a terminal or indeed somewhat ironically in another browser though note that currently the browser client doesnt have feature parity with the terminal client why not vnc well vnc is certainly one solution but it doesnt quite have the same ability to deal with extremely bad internet also terminal browsh can use mosh to further reduce bandwidth and increase stability of the connection mosh offers features like automatic reconnection of dropped or roamed connections and diff only screen updates furthermore other than ssh or mosh terminal browsh doesnt require a client like vnc one final reason to use terminal browsh could be to offload the battery drain of a modern browser from your laptop or low powered device like a raspberry pi if youre a cli native then you could potentially get a few more hours life if your cpu hungry browser is running somewhere else on mains electricity installation download a binary from the releases 2 6mb you will need to have firefox 57 aleady installed or download and run the docker image 230mb with docker run it browsh browsh usage most keys and mouse gestures should work as youd expect on a desktop browser for full documentation see the documentation contributing to setup a dev env you will need nodejs and golang installed if you get stuck setting up your env take a look in travis yml it has to setup everything from scratch for every push to github id recommend nvm for nodejs note that nvm install will automatically parse the nvmrc version in this repo to get the correct nodejs version for golang its probably best to just use your oss package manager the current golang version being used is stored in travis yml youll then need to install the project dependencies for the webextension just run npm install inside the webext folder for the cli client you will first need to install dep there is a script for this in interfacer contrib setup go sh i dont fully understand golangs best practices but it seems you are forced to keep your go projects code under gopath src you might be able to get away with symlinks anyway to install the dependencies use dep ensure inside the interfacer folder then the ideal setup for development is have webpack watch the js code so that it rebuilds automatically webpack watch run the cli client without giving it the responsibility to launch firefox go run interfacer src main go use existing ff debug have mozillas handy web ext tool run firefox and reinstall the webextension everytime webpack rebuilds it in webext dist web ext run verbose tests for the webextension in webext folder npm test for cli unit tests in interfacer run go test src browsh go for cli e2e tests in interfacer run go test test tty go for http service tests in interfacer run go test test http server go special thanks tobimensch for essential early feedback and user testing arasatasaygin for the browsh logo license gnu general public license v3 0
