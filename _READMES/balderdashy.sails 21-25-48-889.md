website get started docs news submit issue sails js is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom enterprise grade node js apps it is designed to resemble the mvc architecture from frameworks like ruby on rails but with support for the more modern data oriented style of web app api development its especially good for building realtime features like chat since version 1 0 sails supports await out of the box this replaces nested callbacks and the commensurate error handling with simple familiar usage javascript var orgs await organization find installation with node installed sh get the latest stable release of sails npm install sails g upgrading from an earlier version of sails available as of node v7 9 and sails v1 0 es8s async await enables dramatic improvements to the way developers build node js sails apps it allows server side javascript code to be written with the await keyword instead of lower level and more fragile flow control mechanisms like nested callbacks and promise chains it lets developers breathe easier by removing the burden of painstaking manual error handling after every database query and best of all it means the end of callback hell the most common source of bugs and stability issues in real world node js sails applications if es8 isnt for you dont worry node callbacks and promise chaining are still fully supported but for most teams the transition to await results in sizable gains in productivity with fewer lines of code upgrade guides for all major releases since 2013 are available on the sails website under upgrading your first

consists of mike mcneil cody stoltman scott gress irl nathan rachael shaw our company designs builds node js websites and apps for startups and enterprise customers after building a few applications and taking them into production we realized that the node js development landscape was very much still the wild west over time after trying lots of different methodologies we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework six years later sails is now one of the most widely used web application frameworks in the world i hope it saves you some time license mit license copyright Â© 2012 present mike mcneil sails is built around so many great open source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary we owe huge gratitude and props to ryan dahl ry tj holowaychuk tj doug wilson dougwilson and guillermo rauch rauchg for the work theyve done as well as the stewards of all the other open source modules we use sails could never have been developed without your tremendous contributions to the javascript community
