pix2code generating code from a graphical user interface screenshot a video demo of the system can be seen here the paper is available at https arxiv org abs 1705 07962 official research page https uizard io research pix2code abstract transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software websites and mobile applications in this paper we show that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end to end to automatically generate code from a single input image with over 77 of accuracy for three different platforms i e ios android and web based technologies citation article beltramelli2017pix2code title pix2code generating code from a graphical user interface

use this software the project pix2code is a research project demonstrating an application of deep neural networks to generate code from visual inputs the current implementation is not in any way intended nor able to generate code in a real world context we could not emphasize enough that this project is experimental and shared for educational purposes only both the source code and the

languages no pix2code is only a research project and will stay in the state described in the paper for consistency reasons this project is really just a toy example but you are of course more than welcome to fork the repo and experiment yourself with other target platforms languages will i be able to use pix2code for my own frontend projects no pix2code is experimental and wont work for your specific use cases how is the model performance measured the accuracy error reported in the paper is measured at the dsl level by comparing each generated token with each expected token any difference in length between the generated token sequence and the expected token sequence is also counted as error how long does it take to train the model on a nvidia tesla k80 gpu it takes a little less than 5 hours to optimize the 109 10 6 parameters for one dataset so expect around 15 hours if you want to train the model for the three target platforms i am a front end developer will i soon lose my job i have genuinely been asked this question multiple times tl dr not anytime soon will ai replace front end developers even assuming a mature version of pix2code able to generate gui code with 100 accuracy for every platforms languages in the universe front enders will still be needed to implement the logic the interactive parts the advanced graphics and animations and all the features users love the product we are building at uizard technologies is intended to bridge the gap between ui ux designers and front end developers not replace any of them we want to rethink the traditional workflow that too often results in more frustration than innovation we want designers to be as creative as possible to better serve end users and developers to dedicate their time programming the core functionality and forget about repetitive tasks such as ui implementation we believe in a future where ai collaborate with humans not replace humans media coverage wired uk the next web fast company
