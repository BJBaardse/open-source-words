sample app appintro appintro is an android library that helps you make a cool intro for your app like the ones in google apps watch the demo video on youtube usage basic usage add the jitpack repository to your build file add it in your root build gradle at the end of repositories gradle allprojects repositories maven url https jitpack io add the dependency gradle dependencies implementation com github apl devs appintro v4 2 3 create a new activity that extends appintro java public class introactivity extends appintro override protected void oncreate nullable bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate note here that we do not use setcontentview add your slide fragments here appintro will automatically generate the dots indicator and buttons addslide firstfragment addslide secondfragment addslide thirdfragment addslide fourthfragment instead of fragments you can also use our default slide just set a title description background and image appintro will do the rest addslide appintrofragment newinstance title description image backgroundcolor optional methods override bar separator color setbarcolor color parsecolor 3f51b5 setseparatorcolor color parsecolor 2196f3 hide skip done button showskipbutton false setprogressbuttonenabled false turn vibration on and set intensity note you will probably need to ask vibrate permission in manifest setvibrate true setvibrateintensity 30 override public void onskippressed fragment currentfragment super onskippressed currentfragment do something when users tap on skip button override public void ondonepressed fragment currentfragment super ondonepressed currentfragment do something when users tap on done button override public void onslidechanged nullable fragment oldfragment nullable fragment newfragment super onslidechanged oldfragment newfragment do something when the slide changes note above that we did not use setcontentview finally declare the activity in your manifest like so xml activity android name com example example intro android label string app intro do not declare the intro as your main app launcher unless you want the intro to launch every time your app starts refer to the wiki for an example of how to launch the intro once from your main activity alternative layout if you want to try an alternative layout as seen in googles photo app just extend appintro2 in your activity thats all java public class introactivity extends appintro2 slides basic slides appintro provides two simple classes appintrofragment and appintro2fragment which one can use to build simple slides java override protected void oncreate nullable bundle savedinstancestate addslide appintrofragment newinstance title description image backgroundcolor custom slides example one may also define custom slides as seen in the example project copy the class sampleslide from my example project add a new slide with addslide sampleslide newinstance r layout your slide here theres no need to create one class for fragment anymore extended usage animations appintro comes with some pager animations choose the one you like and then activate it with java override protected void oncreate nullable bundle savedinstancestate setfadeanimation available animations java setfadeanimation setzoomanimation setflowanimation setslideoveranimation setdepthanimation if you want to create nice parallax effect or your own custom animation create your own pagetransformer and call java override protected void oncreate nullable bundle savedinstancestate setcustomtransformer transformer click here to see how i did it in the example app background color transitions appintro supports background color transitions in order to setup the transitions simply implement islidebackgroundcolorholder java public final class myslide extends fragment implements islidebackgroundcolorholder override public int getdefaultbackgroundcolor return the default background color of the slide return color parsecolor 000000 override public void setbackgroundcolor colorint int backgroundcolor set the background color of the view within your slide to which the transition should be applied if layoutcontainer null layoutcontainer setbackgroundcolor backgroundcolor the api is quite low level therefore highly customizable the interface contains two methods getdefaultbackgroundcolor return the default background color i e the background color the slide has in non sliding state of the slide here setbackgroundcolor int this method will be called while swiping between two slides update the background color of the view to which the transition should be applied this is normally the root view of your fragments layout but one may also apply the color transition to some other view only i e a button runtime permissions android 6 0 android 6 0 introduced a new permissions model for developers now all your apps have to request permissions which can be a tedious thing to implement however appintro simplifies this down to one single line of code java override protected void oncreate nullable bundle savedinstancestate ask for camera permission on the second slide askforpermissions new string manifest permission camera 2 or this will ask for the camera permission and the contacts permission on the same slide ensure your slide talks about both so as not to confuse the user askforpermissions new string manifest permission camera manifest permission read contacts 2 note it is advised that you only put one permission in the string array unless you want the app to ask for multiple permissions on the same slide note 2 requesting permissions automatically disables sliding and users will have to result to pressing the buttons please do not open any issues regarding this as they will be immmediately closed thanks slide policies if you want to restrict navigation between your slides i e the user has to toggle a checkbox in order to continue our slide policy feature might help you all you have to do is implement islidepolicy in your slides java public final class myslide extends fragment implements islidepolicy override public boolean ispolicyrespected return if user should be allowed to leave this slide override public void onuserillegallyrequestednextpage user illegally requested next slide the interface contains two methods ispolicyrespected the return value of this method defines if the user can leave this slide i e navigate to another one onuserillegallyrequestednextpage this method gets called if the user tries to leave the slide although ispolicyrespected returned false one may show some error message here example app see example code here on github you can also see it live by downloading our example on google
