switchyomega manage and switch between multiple proxies quickly easily chromium extension the project is available as a chromium extension you can try it on chrome web store or grab a packaged extension file crx for offline installation on the releases page please report issues on the issue tracker firefox addon experimental there is also an experimental webextension port which allows installing in firefox nightly version 56 since the webextensions api is still under heavy development on mozillas side we strongly recommended using the nightly channel 56 0 and update frequently the developer edition and beta channels will not receive fixes as often and therefore unsupported by switchyomega some users report that it works with the firefox developer edition 55 as well but we strongly advise against doing so it wont work at all in firefox 54 stable you can try it on mozilla add ons or grab a packaged extension file xpi for offline installation on the releases page please make sure that you are using the latest nightly build before you report issues build number and build date should be mentioned somewhere in the issue note pac profiles do not work on firefox due to amo review policies we will see what we can do development status pac generator this project contains a pac generating module called omega pac which handles the profiles model and compile profiles into pac scripts this module is standalone and can be published to npm when the documentation is ready options manager the folder omega target contains browser independent logic for managing the options and applying profiles every public method is well documented in the comments functions related to browser are not included and shall be implemented in subclasses of the omega target classes omega web is a web based configuration interface for various options and profiles the interface works great with omega target as the back end omega web alone is incomplete and requires a file named omega target web js containing an angular module omegatarget the module contains browser dependent code to communicate with omega target back end and other code retrieving browser related state and information see the omega target chromium extension omega target web coffee file for an example of such module targets the omega target folders should contain environment dependent code such as browser api calls each target folder should contain an extended omegatarget object which contains subclasses of the abstract base classes like options the classes contains implementation of the abstract methods and can override other methods at will a target can copy the files in omega web into its build to provide a web based configuration interface if so the target must provide the omega target web js file as described in the options manager section additionally each target can contain other files and resources required for the target such as background pages and extension manifests for now only one target has been implemented the webextension target this target allows the project to be used as a chromium extension in most chromium based browsers and also as a firefox addon as mentioned above translation translation is hosted on weblate if you want to help improve the translated text or start translation for your language please follow the link of the picture below

build the project install node and npm first make sure npm version 2 0 then sudo npm install g grunt cli bower in the project folder cd omega build npm run deps this runs npm install in every module npm run dev this runs npm link to aid local development note the previous command may require sudo in some environments the modules are now working we can build now grunt after building a folder will be generated cd return to project root ls omega chromium extension build the folder above can be loaded as an unpacked extension in chromium now to enable grunt watch run grunt watch once in the omega build directory this will effectively run grunt watch in every module in this project license switchyomega is licensed under gnu general public license version 3 or later switchyomega is free software
