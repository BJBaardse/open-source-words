look at high level trade offs performance vs scalability latency vs throughput availability vs consistency keep in mind that everything is a trade off then well dive into more specific topics such as dns cdns and load balancers performance vs scalability a service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added generally increasing performance means serving more units of work but it can also be to handle larger units of work such as when datasets grow 1 another way to look at performance vs scalability if you have a performance problem your system is slow for a single user if you have a scalability problem your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load source s and further reading a word on scalability scalability availability stability patterns latency vs throughput latency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result throughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time generally you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency source s and further reading understanding latency vs throughput availability vs consistency cap theorem source cap theorem revisited in a distributed computer system you can only support two of the following guarantees consistency every read receives the most recent write or an error availability every request receives a response without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information partition tolerance the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures networks arent reliable so youll need to support partition tolerance youll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability cp consistency and partition tolerance waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error cp is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes ap availability and partition tolerance responses return the most recent version of the data available on the a node which might not be the latest writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved ap is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors source s and further reading cap theorem revisited a plain english introduction to cap theorem cap faq consistency patterns with multiple copies of the same data we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data recall the definition of consistency from the cap theorem every read receives the most recent write or an error weak consistency after a write reads may or may not see it a best effort approach is taken this approach is seen in systems such as memcached weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as voip video chat and realtime multiplayer games for example if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss eventual consistency after a write reads will eventually see it typically within milliseconds data is replicated asynchronously this approach is seen in systems such as dns and email eventual consistency works well in highly available systems strong consistency after a write reads will see it data is replicated synchronously this approach is seen in file systems and rdbmses strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions source s and further reading transactions across data centers availability patterns there are two main patterns to support high availability fail over and replication fail over active passive with active passive fail over heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby if the heartbeat is interrupted the passive server takes over the actives ip address and resumes service the length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in hot standby or whether it needs to start up from cold standby only the active server handles traffic active passive failover can also be referred to as master slave failover active active in active active both servers are managing traffic spreading the load between them if the servers are public facing the dns would need to know about the public ips of both servers if the servers are internal facing application logic would need to know about both servers active active failover can also be referred to as master master failover disadvantage s failover fail over adds more hardware and additional complexity there is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive replication master slave and master master this topic is further discussed in the database section master slave replication master master replication domain name system source dns security presentation a domain name system dns translates a domain name such as www example com to an ip address dns is hierarchical with a few authoritative servers at the top level your router or isp provides information about which dns server s to contact when doing a lookup lower level dns servers cache mappings which could become stale due to dns propagation delays dns results can also be cached by your browser or os for a certain period of time determined by the time to live ttl ns record name server specifies the dns servers for your domain subdomain mx record mail exchange specifies the mail servers for accepting messages a record address points a name to an ip address cname canonical points a name to another name or cname example com to www example com or to an a record services such as cloudflare and route 53 provide managed dns services some dns services can route traffic through various methods weighted round robin prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance balance between varying cluster sizes a b testing latency based geolocation based disadvantage s dns accessing a dns server introduces a slight delay although mitigated by caching described above dns server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments isps and large companies dns services have recently come under ddos attack preventing users from accessing websites such as twitter without knowing twitters ip address es source s and further reading dns architecture wikipedia dns articles content delivery network source why use a cdn a content delivery network cdn is a globally distributed network of proxy servers serving content from locations closer to the user generally static files such as html css js photos and videos are served from cdn although some cdns such as amazons cloudfront support dynamic content the sites dns resolution will tell clients which server to contact serving content from cdns can significantly improve performance in two ways users receive content at data centers close to them your servers do not have to serve requests that the cdn fulfills push cdns push cdns receive new content whenever changes occur on your server you take full responsibility for providing content uploading directly to the cdn and rewriting urls to point to the cdn you can configure when content expires and when it is updated content is uploaded only when it is new or changed minimizing traffic but maximizing storage sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isnt often updated work well with push cdns content is placed on the cdns once instead of being re pulled at regular intervals pull cdns pull cdns grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content you leave the content on your server and rewrite urls to point to the cdn this results in a slower request until the content is cached on the cdn a time to live ttl determines how long content is cached pull cdns minimize storage space on the cdn but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed sites with heavy traffic work well with pull cdns as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently requested content remaining on the cdn disadvantage s cdn cdn costs could be significant depending on traffic although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a cdn content might be stale if it is updated before the ttl expires it cdns require changing urls for static content to point to the cdn source s and further reading globally distributed content delivery the differences between push and pull cdns wikipedia load balancer source scalable system design patterns load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases in each case the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client load balancers are effective at preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers preventing overloading resources helping eliminate single points of failure load balancers can be implemented with hardware expensive or with software such as haproxy additional benefits include ssl termination decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations removes the need to install x 509 certificates on each server session persistence issue cookies and route a specific clients requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions to protect against failures its common to set up multiple load balancers either in active passive or active active mode load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics including random least loaded session cookies round robin or weighted round robin layer 4 layer 7 layer 4 load balancing layer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests generally this involves the source destination ip addresses and ports in the header but not the contents of the packet layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server performing network address translation nat layer 7 load balancing layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests this can involve contents of the header message and cookies layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic reads the message makes a load balancing decision then opens a connection to the selected server for example a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security hardened servers at the cost of flexibility layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than layer 7 although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware horizontal scaling load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling improving performance and availability scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware called vertical scaling it is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems disadvantage s horizontal scaling scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers servers should be stateless they should not contain any user related data like sessions or profile pictures sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database sql nosql or a persistent cache redis memcached downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out disadvantage s load balancer the load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity a single load balancer is a single point of failure configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity source s and further reading nginx architecture haproxy architecture guide scalability wikipedia layer 4 load balancing layer 7 load balancing elb listener config reverse proxy web server source wikipedia a reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the servers response to the client additional benefits include increased security hide information about backend servers blacklist ips limit number of connections per client increased scalability and flexibility clients only see the reverse proxys ip allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration ssl termination decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations removes the need to install x 509 certificates on each server compression compress server responses caching return the response for cached requests static content serve static content directly html css js photos videos etc load balancer vs reverse proxy deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers often load balancers route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server opening up the benefits described in the previous section solutions such as nginx and haproxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing disadvantage s reverse proxy introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity a single reverse proxy is a single point of failure configuring multiple reverse proxies ie a failover further increases complexity source s and further reading reverse proxy vs load balancer nginx architecture haproxy architecture guide wikipedia application layer source intro to architecting systems for scale separating out the web layer from the application layer also known as platform layer allows you to scale and configure both layers independently adding a new api results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers the single responsibility principle advocates for small and autonomous services that work together small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth workers in the application layer also help enable asynchronism microservices related to this discussion are microservices which can be described as a suite of independently deployable small modular services each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well defined lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal 1 pinterest for example could have the following microservices user profile follower feed search photo upload etc service discovery systems such as consul etcd and zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names addresses and ports health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an http endpoint both consul and etcd have a built in key value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data disadvantage s application layer adding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural operations and process viewpoint vs a monolithic system microservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations source s and further reading intro to architecting systems for scale crack the system design interview service oriented architecture introduction to zookeeper heres what you need to know about building microservices database source scaling up to your first 10 million users relational database management system rdbms a relational database like sql is a collection of data items organized in tables acid is a set of properties of relational database transactions atomicity each transaction is all or nothing consistency any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another isolation executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially durability once a transaction has been committed it will remain so there are many techniques to scale a relational database master slave replication master master replication federation sharding denormalization and sql tuning master slave replication the master serves reads and writes replicating writes to one or more slaves which serve only reads slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree like fashion if the master goes offline the system can continue to operate in read only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned source scalability availability stability patterns disadvantage s master slave replication additional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master see disadvantage s replication for points related to both master slave and master master master master replication both masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes if either master goes down the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes source scalability availability stability patterns disadvantage s master master replication youll need a load balancer or youll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write most master master systems are either loosely consistent violating acid or have increased write latency due to synchronization conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases see disadvantage s replication for points related to both master slave and master master disadvantage s replication there is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes writes are replayed to the read replicas if there are a lot of writes the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and cant do as many reads the more read slaves the more you have to replicate which leads to greater replication lag on some systems writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread replication adds more hardware and additional complexity source s and further reading replication scalability availability stability patterns multi master replication federation source scaling up to your first 10 million users federation or functional partitioning splits up databases by function for example instead of a single monolithic database you could have three databases forums users and products resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality with no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel increasing throughput disadvantage s federation federation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables youll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write joining data from two databases is more complex with a server link federation adds more hardware and additional complexity source s and further reading federation scaling up to your first 10 million users sharding source scalability availability stability patterns sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data taking a users database as an example as the number of users increases more shards are added to the cluster similar to the advantages of federation sharding results in less read and write traffic less replication and more cache hits index size is also reduced which generally improves performance with faster queries if one shard goes down the other shards are still operational although youll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss like federation there is no single central master serializing writes allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput common ways to shard a table of users is either through the users last name initial or the users geographic location disadvantage s sharding youll need to update your application logic to work with shards which could result in complex sql queries data distribution can become lopsided in a shard for example a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others rebalancing adds additional complexity a sharding function based on consistent hashing can reduce the amount of transferred data joining data from multiple shards is more complex sharding adds more hardware and additional complexity source s and further reading sharding the coming of the shard shard database architecture consistent hashing denormalization denormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins some rdbms such as postgresql and oracle support materialized views which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent once data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding managing joins across data centers further increases complexity denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins in most systems reads can heavily outnumber writes 100 1 or even 1000 1 a read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive spending a significant amount of time on disk operations disadvantage s denormalization data is duplicated constraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync which increases complexity of the database design a denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart source s and further reading denormalization denormalization sql tuning sql tuning is a broad topic and many books have been written as reference its important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks benchmark simulate high load situations with tools such as ab profile enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues benchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations tighten up the schema mysql dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access use char instead of varchar for fixed length fields char effectively allows for fast random access whereas with varchar you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one use text for large blocks of text such as blog posts text also allows for boolean searches using a text field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block use int for larger numbers up to 2 32 or 4 billion use decimal for currency to avoid floating point representation errors avoid storing large blobs store the location of where to get the object instead varchar 255 is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number often maximizing the use of a byte in some rdbms set the not null constraint where applicable to improve search performance use good indices columns that you are querying select group by order by join could be faster with indices indices are usually represented as self balancing b tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches sequential access insertions and deletions in logarithmic time placing an index can keep the data in memory requiring more space writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated when loading large amounts of data it might be faster to disable indices load the data then rebuild the indices avoid expensive joins denormalize where performance demands it partition tables break up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory tune the query cache in some cases the query cache could lead to performance issues source s and further reading sql tuning tips for optimizing mysql queries is there a good reason i see varchar 255 used so often how do null values affect performance slow query log nosql nosql is a collection of data items represented in a key value store document store wide column store or a graph database data is denormalized and joins are generally done in the application code most nosql stores lack true acid transactions and favor eventual consistency base is often used to describe the properties of nosql databases in comparison with the cap theorem base chooses availability over consistency basically available the system guarantees availability soft state the state of the system may change over time even without input eventual consistency the system will become consistent over a period of time given that the system doesnt receive input during that period in addition to choosing between sql or nosql it is helpful to understand which type of nosql database best fits your use case s well review key value stores document stores wide column stores and graph databases in the next section key value store abstraction hash table a key value store generally allows for o 1 reads and writes and is often backed by memory or ssd data stores can maintain keys in lexicographic order allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges key value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value key value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly changing data such as an in memory cache layer since they offer only a limited set of operations complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed a key value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document

abstraction key value store with documents stored as values a document store is centered around documents xml json binary etc where a document stores all information for a given object document stores provide apis or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself note many key value stores include features for working with a values metadata blurring the lines between these two storage types based on the underlying implementation documents are organized in either collections tags metadata or directories although documents can be organized or grouped together documents may have fields that are completely different from each other some document stores like mongodb and couchdb also provide a sql like language to perform complex queries dynamodb

reading sql or nosql scaling up to your first 10 million users sql vs nosql differences cache source scalable system design patterns caching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases in this model the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return in order to save the actual execution databases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions popular items can skew the distribution causing bottlenecks putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic client caching caches can be located on the client side os or browser server side or in a distinct cache layer cdn caching cdns are considered a type of cache web server caching reverse proxies and caches such as varnish can serve static and dynamic content directly web servers can also cache requests returning responses without having to contact application servers database caching your database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration optimized for a generic use case tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance application caching in memory caches such as memcached and redis are key value stores between your application and your data storage since the data is held in ram it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk ram is more limited than disk so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used lru can help invalidate cold entries and keep hot data in ram redis has the following additional features persistence option built in data structures such as sorted sets and lists there are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories database queries and objects row level query level fully formed serializable objects fully rendered html generally you should try to avoid file based caching as it makes cloning and auto scaling more difficult caching at the database query level whenever you query the database hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache this approach suffers from expiration issues hard to delete a cached result with complex queries if one piece of data changes such as a table cell you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell caching at the object level see your data as an object similar to what you do with your application code have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure s remove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed allows for asynchronous processing workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object suggestions of what to cache user sessions fully rendered web pages activity streams user graph data when to update the cache since you can only store a limited amount of data in cache youll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case cache aside source from cache to in memory data grid the application is responsible for reading and writing from storage the cache does not interact with storage directly the application does the following look for entry in cache resulting in a cache miss load entry from the database add entry to cache return entry def get user self user id user cache get user 0 user id if user is none user db query select from users where user id 0 user id if user is not none key user 0 format user id cache set key json dumps user return user memcached is generally used in this manner subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast cache aside is also referred to as lazy loading only requested data is cached which avoids filling up the cache with data that isnt requested disadvantage s cache aside each cache miss results in three trips which can cause a noticeable delay data can become stale if it is updated in the database this issue is mitigated by setting a time to live ttl which forces an update of the cache entry or by using write through when a node fails it is replaced by a new empty node increasing latency write through source scalability availability stability patterns the application uses the cache as the main data store reading and writing data to it while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database application adds updates entry in cache cache synchronously writes entry to data store return application code set user 12345 foo bar cache code def set user user id values user db query update users where id 0 user id values cache set user id user write through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation but subsequent reads of just written data are fast users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data data in the cache is not stale disadvantage s write through when a new node is created due to failure or scaling the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database cache aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue most data written might never read which can be minimized with a ttl write behind write back source scalability availability stability patterns in write behind the application does the following add update entry in cache asynchronously write entry to the data store improving write performance disadvantage s write behind there could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store it is more complex to implement write behind than it is to implement cache aside or write through refresh ahead source from cache to in memory data grid you can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration refresh ahead can result in reduced latency vs read through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future disadvantage s refresh ahead not accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh ahead disadvantage s cache need to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through cache invalidation cache invalidation is a difficult problem there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache need to make application changes such as adding redis or memcached source s and further reading from cache to in memory data grid scalable system design patterns introduction to architecting systems for scale scalability availability

operations that would otherwise be performed in line they can also help by doing time consuming work in advance such as periodic aggregation of data message queues message queues receive hold and deliver messages if an operation is too slow to perform inline you can use a message queue with the following workflow an application publishes a job to the queue then notifies the user of job status a worker picks up the job from the queue processes it then signals the job is complete the user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background during this time the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed for example if posting a tweet the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers redis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost rabbitmq is popular but requires you to adapt to the amqp protocol and manage your own nodes amazon sqs is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice task queues tasks queues receive tasks and their related data runs them then delivers their results they can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally intensive jobs in the background celery has support for scheduling and primarily has python support back pressure if queues start to grow significantly the queue size can become larger than memory resulting in cache misses disk reads and even slower performance back pressure can help by limiting the queue size thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue once the queue fills up clients get a server busy or http 503 status code to try again later clients can retry the request at a later time perhaps with exponential backoff disadvantage s asynchronism use cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations as introducing queues can add delays and complexity source s and further reading its all a numbers game applying back pressure when overloaded littles law what is the difference between a message queue and a task queue communication source osi 7 layer model hypertext transfer protocol http http is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server it is a request response protocol clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request http is self contained allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing caching encryption and compression a basic http request consists of a verb method and a resource endpoint below are common http verbs verb description idempotent safe cacheable get reads a resource yes yes yes post creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data no no yes if response contains freshness info put creates or replace a resource yes no no patch partially updates a resource no no yes if response contains freshness info delete deletes a resource yes no no can be called many times without different outcomes http is an application layer protocol relying on lower level protocols such as tcp and udp source s and further reading http what is http difference between http and tcp difference between put and patch transmission control protocol tcp source how to make a multiplayer game tcp is a connection oriented protocol over an ip network connection is established and terminated using a handshake all packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through sequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet acknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission if the sender does not receive a correct response it will resend the packets if there are multiple timeouts the connection is dropped tcp also implements flow control and congestion control these guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than udp to ensure high throughput web servers can keep a large number of tcp connections open resulting in high memory usage it can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say a memcached server connection pooling can help in addition to switching to udp where applicable tcp is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical some examples include web servers database info smtp ftp and ssh use tcp over udp when you need all of the data to arrive intact you want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput user datagram protocol udp source how to make a multiplayer game udp is connectionless datagrams analogous to packets are guaranteed only at the datagram level datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all udp does not support congestion control without the guarantees that tcp support udp is generally more efficient udp can broadcast sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet this is useful with dhcp because the client has not yet received an ip address thus preventing a way for tcp to stream without the ip address udp is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as voip video chat streaming and realtime multiplayer games use udp over tcp when you need the lowest latency late data is worse than loss of data you want to implement your own error correction source s and further reading tcp and udp networking for game programming key differences between tcp and udp protocols difference between tcp and udp transmission control protocol user datagram protocol scaling memcache at facebook remote procedure call rpc source crack the system design interview in an rpc a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space usually a remote server the procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish rpc calls from local calls popular rpc frameworks include protobuf thrift and avro rpc is a request response protocol client program calls the client stub procedure the parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call client stub procedure marshals packs procedure id and arguments into a request message client communication module os sends the message from the client to the server server communication module os passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure server stub procedure unmarshalls the results calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments the server response repeats the steps above in reverse order sample rpc calls get someoperation data anid post anotheroperation data anid anotherdata another value rpc is focused on exposing behaviors rpcs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications as you can hand craft native calls to better fit your use cases choose a native library aka sdk when you know your target platform you want to control how your logic is accessed you want to control how error control happens off your library performance and end user experience is your primary concern http apis following rest tend to be used more often for public apis disadvantage s rpc rpc clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation a new api must be defined for every new operation or use case it can be difficult to debug rpc you might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box for example it might require additional effort to ensure rpc calls are properly cached on caching servers such as squid representational state transfer rest rest is an architectural style enforcing a client server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server the server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources all communication must be stateless and cacheable there are four qualities of a restful interface identify resources uri in http use the same uri regardless of any operation change with representations verbs in http use verbs headers and body self descriptive error message status response in http use status codes dont reinvent the wheel hateoas html interface for http your web service should be fully accessible in a browser sample rest calls get someresources anid put someresources anid anotherdata another value rest is focused on exposing data it minimizes the coupling between client server and is often used for public http apis rest uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through uris representation through headers and actions through verbs such as get post put delete and patch being stateless rest is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning disadvantage s rest with rest being focused on exposing data it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy for example returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path with rest it is likely to be implemented with a combination of uri path query parameters and possibly the request body rest typically relies on a few verbs get post put delete and patch which sometimes doesnt fit your use case for example moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views e g fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry for mobile applications operating in variable network conditions these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable over time more fields might be added to an api response and older clients will receive all new data fields even those that they do not need as a result it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies rpc and rest calls comparison operation rpc rest signup post signup post persons resign post resign personid 1234 delete persons 1234 read a person get readperson
