asset loader sprite sheet loader auto detect which renderer should be used full mouse and multi touch interaction text bitmapfont text multiline text render texture primitive drawing masking filters user plugins basic usage example js the application will create a renderer using webgl if possible with a fallback to a canvas render it will also setup the ticker and the root stage pixi container const app new pixi application the application will create a canvas element for you that you can then insert into the dom document body appendchild app view load the texture we need pixi loader add bunny bunny png load loader resources this creates a texture from a bunny png image const bunny new pixi sprite resources bunny texture setup the position of the bunny bunny x app renderer width 2 bunny y app renderer height 2 rotate around the center bunny anchor x 0 5 bunny anchor y 0 5 add the bunny to the scene we are building app stage addchild bunny listen for frame updates app ticker add each frame we spin the bunny around a bit bunny rotation 0 01 how to build note that for most users you dont need to build this project if all you want is to use pixijs then just download one of our prebuilt releases really the only time you should need to build pixijs is if you are developing it if you dont already have node js and npm go install them then in the folder where you have cloned the repository install the build dependencies using npm sh npm install then to build the source run sh npm run dist this will create a minified version at dist pixi min js and a non minified version at dist pixi js with all the plugins in the pixijs project if there are specific plugins you dont want say interaction or extras you can exclude those sh npm run dist exclude extras exclude interaction you can also use the short form e sh npm run dist e extras e interaction e filters how to generate the documentation the docs can be generated using npm sh npm run docs the documentation uses jaguar js and the jsdoc format the configuration file can be found at scripts jsdoc conf json license this content is released under the http opensource org licenses mit mit license
