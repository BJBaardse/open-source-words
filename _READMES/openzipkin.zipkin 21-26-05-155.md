zipkin zipkin is a distributed tracing system it helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures it manages both the collection and lookup of this data zipkins design is based on the google dapper paper this project includes a dependency free library and a spring boot server storage options include in memory jdbc mysql cassandra and elasticsearch quick start the quickest way to get started is to fetch the latest released server as a self contained executable jar note that the zipkin server requires minimum jre 8 for example bash curl ssl https zipkin io quickstart sh bash s java jar zipkin jar you can also start zipkin via docker bash docker run d p 9411 9411 openzipkin zipkin once the server is running you can view traces with the zipkin ui at http your host 9411 zipkin if your applications arent sending traces yet configure them with zipkin instrumentation or try one of our examples check out the zipkin server documentation for configuration details or docker zipkin for how to use docker compose core library the core library is used by both zipkin instrumentation and the zipkin server its minimum java language level is 6 in efforts to support those writing agent instrumentation this includes built in codec for zipkins v1 and v2 json formats a direct dependency on gson json library is avoided by minifying and repackaging classes used the result is a 155k jar which wont conflict with any library you use ex java all data are recorded against the same endpoint associated with your service graph localendpoint endpoint newbuilder servicename tweetie ip 192 168 0 1 build span span newbuilder traceid d3d200866a77cc59 id d3d200866a77cc59 name targz localendpoint localendpoint timestamp epochmicros duration durationinmicros puttag compression level 9 now you can encode it as json bytes spanbytesencoder json v2 encode span note the above is just an example most likely youll want to use an existing tracing library like brave storage component zipkin includes a storagecomponent used to store and query spans and dependency links this is used by the server and those making custom servers collectors or span reporters for this reason storage components have minimal dependencies but most require java 8 ex java this wont create network connections storage elasticsearchstorage newbuilder hosts aslist http myelastic 9200 build prepare a call tracecall storage spanstore gettrace d3d200866a77cc59 execute it synchronously or asynchronously trace tracecall execute clean up any sessions etc storage close in memory the inmemorystorage component is packaged in zipkins core library it is neither persistent nor viable for realistic work loads its purpose is for testing for example starting a server on your laptop without any database needed cassandra the cassandra component is tested against cassandra 3 11 it stores spans using udts such that they appear like the v2 zipkin model in cqlsh it is designed for scale for example it uses a combination of sasi and manually implemented indexes to make querying larger data more performant note this store requires a spark job to aggregate dependency links elasticsearch the elasticsearch component is tested against elasticsearch 2 6 x it stores spans as json and has been designed for larger scale note this store requires a spark job to aggregate dependency links disabling search search is enabled by default primarily in support of the get traces get spans and get services endpoints used by the find a trace screen in zipkins ui when search is disabled traces can only be retrieved by id sites who use another service such as logs to find trace ids can disable search to reduce storage costs or increase write throughput storagecomponent builder searchenabled false is implied when a zipkin is run with the env variable search enabled false legacy v1 components the following components are no longer encouraged but exist to help aid transition to supported ones these are indicated as v1 as they use data layouts based on zipkins v1 thrift model as opposed to the simpler v2 data model currently used mysql the mysql v1 component currently is only tested with mysql 5 6 7 it is designed to be easy to understand and get started with for example it deconstructs spans into columns so you can perform ad hoc queries using sql however this component has known performance issues queries will eventually take seconds to return if you put a lot of data into it cassandra the cassandra v1 component is tested against cassandra 2 2 it stores spans as opaque thrifts which means you cant read them in cqlsh however it is designed for scale for example it has manually implemented indexes to make querying larger data more performant this store requires a spark job to aggregate dependency links running the server from source the zipkin server receives spans via http post and respond to queries from its ui it can also run collectors such as rabbitmq or kafka to run the server from the currently checked out source enter the following jdk 8 is required bash build the server and also make its dependencies mvnw dskiptests also make pl zipkin server clean install run the server java jar zipkin server target zipkin server exec jar artifacts library releases releases are uploaded to bintray library snapshots snapshots are uploaded to jfrog after commits to master docker images released versions of zipkin server are published to docker hub as openzipkin zipkin see docker zipkin for details javadocs http zipkin io zipkin contains versioned folders with javadocs published on each non pr build as well as releases
