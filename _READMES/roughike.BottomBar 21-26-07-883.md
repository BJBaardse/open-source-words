bottombar deprecated i dont have time to maintain this anymore i basically wrote the whole library in a rush without tests while being a serious expert beginner at the time as a result theres a lot of unpredictable moving parts and the tests probably arent that great either dont really know since i havent touched this in ages id recommend you to use the official bottomnavigationview from google and urge them to implement the features you need or use another 3rd party library if someone wants to pick up where i left off make a fork of this notify me and ill link to your repo here version 2 0 released the latest version before that can be found in the v1 branch cleaner code and better apis no more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess now the look feel and behavior is defined in xml as it should be no more nasty regressions thanks to the automated tests everything is a little different compared to earlier but its for the greater good how to contribute changelog what a custom view
