glide vendor package management for golang are you used to tools such as cargo npm composer nuget pip maven bundler or other modern package managers if so glide is the comparable go tool manage your vendor and vendored packages with ease glide is a tool for managing the vendor directory within a go package this feature first introduced in go 1 5 allows each package to have a vendor directory containing dependent packages for the project these vendor packages can be installed by a tool e g glide similar to go get or they can be vendored and distributed with the package golang dep the go community now has the dep project to manage dependencies please consider trying to migrate from glide to dep if there is an issue preventing you from migrating please file an issue with dep so the problem can be corrected glide will continue to be supported for some time but is considered to be in a state of support rather than active feature development features ease dependency management support versioning packages including semantic versioning 2 0 0 support any constraint the github com masterminds semver package can parse can be used support aliasing packages e g for working with github forks remove the need for munging import statements work with all of the go tools support the vcs tools that go supports git bzr hg svn support custom local and global plugins see docs plugins md repository caching and data caching for improved performance flatten dependencies resolving version differences and avoiding the inclusion of a package multiple times manage and install dependencies on demand or vendored in your version control system how it works glide scans the source code of your application or library to determine the needed dependencies to determine the versions and locations such as aliases for forks glide reads a glide yaml file with the rules with this information glide retrieves needed dependencies when a dependent package is encountered its imports are scanned to determine dependencies of dependencies transitive dependencies if the dependent project contains a glide yaml file that information is used to help determine the dependency rules when fetching from a location or version to use configuration from godep gb gom and gpm is also imported the dependencies are exported to the vendor directory where the go tools can find and use them a glide lock file is generated containing all the dependencies including transitive ones the glide init command can be use to setup a new project glide update regenerates the dependency versions using scanning and rules and glide install will install the versions listed in the glide lock file skipping scanning unless the glide lock file is not found in which case it will perform an update a project is structured like this gopath src myproject your project glide yaml glide lock main go your main go code can live here mysubpackage you can create your own subpackages too foo go vendor github com masterminds etc take a look at the glide source code to see this philosophy in action install the easiest way to install the latest release on mac or linux is with the following script curl https glide sh get sh on mac os x you can also install the latest release via homebrew brew install glide on ubuntu precise 12 04 trusty 14 04 wily 15 10 or xenial 16 04 you can install from our ppa sudo add apt repository ppa masterminds glide sudo apt get update sudo apt get install glide on ubuntu zesty 17 04 the package is called golang glide binary packages are available for mac linux and windows for a development version it is also possible to go get github com masterminds glide to build from source you can clone this repository into gopath src github com masterminds glide and change directory into it if you are using go 1 5 ensure the environment variable go15vendorexperiment is set for example by running export go15vendorexperiment 1 in go 1 6 it is enabled by default and in go 1 7 it is always enabled without the ability to turn it off run make build this will leave you with glide which you can put in your path if youd like you can also take a look at make install to install for you the glide repo has now been configured to use glide to manage itself too usage glide create start a new workspace open glide yaml and edit away glide get github com masterminds cookoo get a package and add to glide yaml glide install install packages and dependencies work work work go build go tools work normally glide up update to newest versions of the package check out the glide yaml in this directory or examples in the docs directory glide create aliased to init initialize a new workspace among other things this creates a glide yaml file while attempting to guess the packages and versions to put in it for example if your project is using godep it will use the versions specified there glide is smart enough to scan your codebase and detect the imports being used whether they are specified with another package manager or not glide create info generating a yaml configuration file and guessing the dependencies info attempting to import from other package managers use skip import to skip info scanning code to look for dependencies info found reference to github com masterminds semver info found reference to github com masterminds vcs info found reference to github com codegangsta cli info found reference to gopkg in yaml v2 info writing configuration file glide yaml info would you like glide to help you find ways to improve your glide yaml configuration info if you want to revisit this step you can use the config wizard command at any time info yes y or no n n info you can now edit the glide yaml file consider info using versions and ranges see https glide sh docs versions info adding additional metadata see https glide sh docs glide yaml info running the config wizard command to improve the versions in your configuration the config wizard noted here can be run here or manually run at a later time this wizard helps you figure out versions and ranges you can use for your dependencies glide config wizard this runs a wizard that scans your dependencies and retrieves information on them to offer up suggestions that you can interactively choose for example it can discover if a dependency uses semantic versions and help you choose the version ranges to use glide get package name you can download one or more packages to your vendor directory and have it added to your glide yaml file with glide get glide get github com masterminds cookoo when glide get is used it will introspect the listed package to resolve its dependencies including using godep gpm gom and gb config files glide update aliased to up download or update all of the libraries listed in the glide yaml file and put them in the vendor directory it will also recursively walk through the dependency packages to fetch anything thats needed and read in any configuration glide up this will recurse over the packages looking for other projects managed by glide godep gb gom and gpm when one is found those packages will be installed as needed a glide lock file will be created or updated with the dependencies pinned to specific versions for example if in the glide yaml file a version was specified as a range e g 1 2 3 it will be set to a specific commit id in the glide lock file that allows for reproducible installs see glide install to remove any nested vendor directories from fetched packages see the v flag glide install when you want to install the specific versions from the glide lock file use glide install glide install this will read the glide lock file and install the commit id specific versions there when the glide lock file doesnt tie to the glide yaml file such as there being a change it will provide a warning running glide up will recreate the glide lock file when updating the dependency tree if no glide lock file is present glide install will perform an update and generate a lock file to remove any nested vendor directories from fetched packages see the v flag glide novendor aliased to nv when you run commands like go test it will iterate over all the subdirectories including the vendor directory when you are testing your application you may want to test your application files without running all the tests of your dependencies and their dependencies this is where the novendor command comes in it lists all of the directories except vendor go test glide novendor this will run go test over all directories of your project except the vendor directory glide name when youre scripting with glide there are occasions where you need to know the name of the package youre working on glide name returns the name of the package listed in the glide yaml file glide tree glide includes a few commands that inspect code and give you details about what is imported glide tree is one such command running it gives data

glide help print the glide help glide help glide version print the version and exit glide version glide version 0 12 0 glide yaml for full details on the glide yaml files see the documentation the glide yaml file does two critical things it names the current package it declares external dependencies a brief glide yaml file looks like this yaml package github com masterminds glide import package github com masterminds semver package github com masterminds cookoo version 1 2 0 repo git github com masterminds cookoo git the above tells glide that this package is named github com masterminds glide that this package depends on two libraries the first library exemplifies a minimal package import it merely gives the fully qualified import path when glide reads the definition for the second library it will get the repo from the source in repo checkout the latest version between 1 2 0 and 2 0 0 and put it in github com masterminds cookoo in the vendor directory note that package and repo can be completely different tip the version is either vcs dependent and can be anything that can be checked out or a semantic version constraint that can be parsed by the github com masterminds semver package for example with git this can be a branch tag or hash this varies and depends on whats supported in the vcs tip in general you are advised to use the base package name for importing a package not a subpackage name for example use github com kylelemons go gypsy and not github com kylelemons go gypsy yaml supported version control systems the git svn mercurial hg and bzr source control systems are supported this happens through the vcs package frequently asked questions f a q q why does glide have the concept of sub packages when go doesnt in go every directory is a package this works well when you have one repo containing all of your packages when you have different packages in different vcs locations things become a bit more complicated a project containing a collection of packages should be handled with the same information including the version by grouping packages this way we are able to manage the related information q bzr or hg is not working the way i expected why these are works in progress and may need some additional tuning please take a look at the vcs package if you see a better way to handle it please let us know q should i check vendor into version control thats up to you its not necessary but it may also cause you extra work and lots of extra space in your vcs there may also be unforeseen errors see an example q how do i import settings from gpm godep gom or gb there are two parts to importing if a package you import has configuration for gpm godep gom or gb glide will recursively install the dependencies automatically if you would like to import configuration from gpm godep gom or gb to glide see the glide import command for example you can run glide import godep for glide to detect the projects godep configuration and generate a glide yaml file for you each of these will merge your existing glide yaml file with the dependencies it finds for those managers and then emit the file as output it will not overwrite your glide yaml file you can write it to file like this glide import godep f glide yaml q can glide fetch a package based on os or arch a yes using the os and arch fields on a package you can specify which oses and architectures the package should be fetched for for example the following package will only be fetched for 64 bit darwin osx systems yaml package some package os darwin arch amd64 the package will not be fetched for other architectures or oses license this package is made available under an mit style license see license txt thanks we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the gpm and gvp projects which inspired many of the features of this package if glide isnt the right go project manager for you check out those the composer php npm javascript and bundler ruby projects all inspired various aspects of this tool as well the name aside from being catchy glide is a contraction of go elide the idea is to compress the tasks that normally take us lots of time into a just a few seconds
