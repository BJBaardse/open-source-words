state of the art result for all machine learning problems last update 17th november 2017 news i am looking for a collaborator esp who does research in nlp computer vision and reinforcement learning if you are not a researcher but you are willing contact me email me redditsota gmail com this repository provides state of the art sota results for all machine learning problems we do our best to keep this repository up to date if you do find a problems sota result is out of date or missing please raise this as an issue with this information research paper name dataset metric source code and year we will fix it immediately you can also submit this google form if you are new to github this is an attempt to make one stop for all types of machine learning problems state of the art result i can not do this alone i need help from everyone please submit the google form raise an issue if you find sota result for a dataset please share this on twitter facebook and other social media this summary
