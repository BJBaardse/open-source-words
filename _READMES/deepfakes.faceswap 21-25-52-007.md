notice this repository is not operated or maintained by u deepfakes please read the explanation below for details deepfakes faceswap faceswap is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos manifesto faceswap is not porn when faceswaping using an ai was first developed and became published the technology was groundbreaking it was a huge step in ai development it was also completely ignored outside of academia the code was confusing and fragmentary it required a thorough understanding of state of the art ai techniques and a lot of effort to get anything out of it one individual brought it together into one cohesive collection it ran it worked and as is so often the way with new technology emerging on the internet it was immediately used to create porn the problem was that this was the first ai code that anyone could download run and learn by experimentation without becoming a phd candidate in math computer theory psychology and more before deepfakes these techniques were like black magic only practiced by those who could understand all of the inner workings as described in esoteric and endlessly complicated books and papers deepfakes changed all that and anyone could participate in ai development to us developers the release of this code has opened up a fantastic learning opportunity to build on ideas developed by others to collaborate with coders with a huge variety of skills to experiment with ai whilst learning new skills and ultimately contribute towards an emerging technology which will only see more mainstream use as it progresses are there some out there doing horrible things with similar software yes and because of this the developers have been following strict ethical standards many of us dont even use it to create videos at all we just tinker with the code to see what it all does sadly the media concentrates only on the unethical uses of this software that is unfortunately a nature of how it was first exposed to the public but it is not representative of why it was created how we use it now or what we see in its future like any technology it can be used for good or it can be abused it is our intention to develop faceswap in a way that its potential for abuse is minimized whilst maximizing its potential as a tool for learning experimenting and yes for legitimate faceswaping we are not trying to denigrate celebrities or to demean anyone we are programmers we are engineers we are hollywood vfx artists we are activists we are hobbyists we are human beings to this end we feel that its time to come out with a standard statement of what this software is and isnt as far as us developers are concerned faceswap is not for creating porn faceswap is not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding its use faceswap is not for any illicit unethical or questionable purposes faceswap exists to experiment and discover ai techniques for social or political commentary for movies and for any number of ethical and reasonable uses we are very troubled by the fact that faceswap can be used for unethical and disreputable things however we support the development of tools and techniques that can be used ethically as well as provide education and experience in ai for anyone who wants to learn it hands on we will take a zero tolerance approach to anyone using this software for any unethical purposes and will actively discourage any such uses overview the project has multiple entry points you will have to gather photos or use the one provided in the training data provided below extract faces from your raw photos train a model on your photos or use the one provided in the training data provided below convert your sources with the model extract from your setup folder run python faceswap py extract this will take photos from src folder and extract faces into extract folder train from your setup folder run python faceswap py train this will take photos from two folders containing pictures of both faces and train a model that will be saved inside the models folder convert from your setup folder run python faceswap py convert this will take photos from original folder and apply new faces into modified folder gui alternatively you can run the gui by running python faceswap py gui general notes all of the scripts mentioned have h help options with arguments that they will accept youre smart you can figure out how this works right nb there is a conversion tool for video this can be accessed by running python tools py effmpeg h alternatively you can use ffmpeg to convert video into photos process images and convert images back to video training data a pre trained model is not required but you can download the following pre trained cage trump training model whole project with training images and trained model 300mb https anonfile com p7w3m0d5be face swap zip or click here to download how to setup and run the project setup clone the repo and setup you environment you can either use the docker image or run python setup py check out install md and usage md for more detailed instructions and basic information on how to configure virtualenv you also need a modern gpu with cuda support for best performance some tips reusing existing models will train much faster than starting from nothing if there is not enough training data start with someone who looks similar then switch the data how to contribute for people interested in the generative models go to the faceswap model to discuss suggest commit alternatives to the current algorithm for devs read this readme entirely fork the repo download the data with the link provided below play with it check issues with the dev tag for devs more interested in computer vision and opencv look at issues with the opencv tag also feel free to add your own alternatives improvments for non dev advanced users read this readme entirely clone the repo download the data with the link provided below play with it check issues with the advuser tag also go to the faceswap playground repo and help others for end users get the code here and play with it if you can you can also go to the faceswap playground repo and help or get help from others be patient this is relatively new technology for developers as well much effort is already being put into making this program easy to use for the average user it just takes time notice any issue related to running the code has to be open in the faceswap playground project for haters sorry no time for that about github com deepfakes what is this repo it is a community repository for active users why this repo the joshua wu repo seems not active simple bugs like missing http in front of urls have not been solved since days why is it named deepfakes if it is not u deepfakes because a typosquat would have happened sooner or later as project grows because we wanted to recognize the original author because it will better federate contributors and users what if u deepfakes feels bad about that this is a friendly typosquat and it is fully dedicated to the project if u deepfakes wants to take over this repo user and drive the project he is welcomed to do so raise an issue and he will be contacted on reddit please do not send u deepfakes messages for help with the code you find here about machine learning how does a computer know how to recognise shape a faces how does machine learning work what is a neural network its complicated heres a good video that makes the process understandable heres a slightly more in depth video that tries to explain the basic functioning of a neural network tl dr training data trial and error
