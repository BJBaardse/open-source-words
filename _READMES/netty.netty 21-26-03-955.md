netty project netty is an asynchronous event driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers clients links web site downloads documentation netty project how to build for the detailed information about building and developing netty please visit the developer guide this page only gives very basic information you require the following to build netty latest stable oracle jdk 7 latest stable apache maven if you are on linux you need additional development packages installed on your system because youll build the native transport note that this is build time requirement jdk 5 for 3 x or 6 for 4 0 is enough to run your netty based application branches to look development of all versions takes place in each branch whose name is identical to majorversion minorversion for example the development of 3 9 and 4 0 resides in the branch 3 9 and the branch 4 0 respectively usage with jdk 9 netty can be used in modular jdk9 applications as a collection of automatic modules the module names follow the reverse dns style and are derived from subproject names rather than root packages due to historical reasons they are listed below io netty all io netty buffer io netty codec io netty codec dns io netty codec haproxy io netty codec http io netty codec http2 io netty codec memcache io netty codec mqtt io netty codec redis io netty codec smtp io netty codec socks io netty codec stomp io netty codec xml io netty common io netty handler io netty handler proxy io netty resolver io netty resolver dns io netty transport io netty transport epoll native omitted reserved keyword in java io netty transport kqueue native omitted reserved keyword in java io netty transport unix common native omitted reserved keyword in java io netty transport rxtx io netty transport sctp io netty transport udt automatic modules do not provide any means to declare dependencies so you need to list each used module separately in your module info file
