dragging the target settings element will open close the pane mindragdistance the minimum amount of pixels the user needs to drag within the slideintent degrees to move the pane slideintent the number of degrees the user must initiate sliding in towards the left or right see diagram below notes on slide intent the slide intent is an int between 0 and 90 and represents the degrees in the first quadrant of a circle that you would like to have mirrored on the x and y axis for example if you have 40 set as your slideintent value the user would only be able to slide the pane by dragging in the blue area in the diagram below once intent has been defined it will not change until the user releases public methods open opens the pane to the specified side javascript snapper open left or snapper open right close closes the pane javascript snapper close expand opens the pane entirely javascript snapper expand left or snapper expand right disable disables sliding events javascript snapper disable enable enables sliding events after disabling javascript snapper enable on adds an event hook javascript snapper on start function do something the available methods to hook into are as follows start fired when touching down on the draggable pane and it begins to move drag fired when the pane has been moved or slid end fired when the pane has been let go of animating fired when the pane is animating animated fired when the pane is finished its animations ignore fired when trying to drag the pane but ended up dragging on an ignored element close fired when close is called directly or if taptoclose is set to true open fired when the menu is opened expandleft fired on expand left expandright fired on expand right enable fired on enable disable fired on disable off removes an event hook javascript snapper off drag the event names listed above apply for the off method settings updates the settings for an already instantiated object javascript snapper settings yoursettings currently settings element settings touchtodrag cannot be updated to update the element instantiate a new object to allow listening to a drag use snapper enable state returns detailed information about the state of the pane javascript var data snapper state the data returned from the state method will look like the following javascript state closed state of the pane info opening left side which user intends to open towards right direction user is dragging towards hyperextending false true if user is pulling past predefined bounds halfway false true if pane is at least halfway open flick false true if user has moved pane x amount of pixels in the open close direction without changing directions translation absolute 20 pixels pane has translated relative 21 pixels pane has translated relative to starting translation sincedirectionchange 10 pixels pane has translated since the direction of the pane has changed percentage 40 571649 the percentage that the pane is open good or animating other things gotchas layout the layout itself is what most people will have a hard time emulating so the simplest approach i have found is as follows two absolute elements one to represent all the content and another to represent all the drawers the content has a higher z index than the drawers within the drawers element its direct children should represent the containers for the drawers these should be fixed or absolute assigning classes to your drawers to specify which side it is on is recommended all absolutely positioned elements should have 0 for top left right bottom properties excluding your panes which will have auto set to their respective sides and a width assigned the width of your drawers is usually the same number you want to use for minposition and maxposition html div drawers position absolute div left drawer position absolute content div right drawer position absolute content div content position absolute top bars content overflow auto bottom bars a sample layout is found in demo apps default html independent scrolling some css is required to get some smooth ass scrolling utilize the css below to apply this to any of your elements css scrollable overflow auto webkit transition property top bottom transition property top bottom webkit transition duration 2s 2s transition duration 2s 2s webkit transition timing function linear linear transition timing function linear linear webkit overflow scrolling touch z indeces and display because of the nature of this code drawers are just kind of stacked behind the content to bring the proper drawer to the front you can hook into snaps js css classes with addbodyclasses set to true in your initialize options one of the two classess will be added to the body tag snapjs left or snapjs right depending on which pane is being open respectively this being said you can apply your css like the following to show the proper drawers css snapjs right left drawer snapjs left right drawer display none faq how do i make a toggle button toggles have been a popular request but rather than bog the library down with additional methods you can utilize the powerful api of snap js to create your own toggle toggles can be done like the following javascript mytogglebutton addeventlistener click function if snapper state state left snapper close else snapper open left how do i disable snap js dragging for my touch slider snap js supports cascading cancellation of events via a data attribute data snap ignore if you were to use a slider your markup might look like the following html div class slider data snap ignore true ul li img src slide jpg li li img src slide jpg li li img src slide jpg li li img src slide jpg li li img src slide jpg li ul div all interactions on children elements of the element with the data snap ignore attribute will have their snap js events ignored i am using push js from ratchet i keep losing my events on my elements how can i fix this simple as wack as push js is yes it is in desperate need of attention as of v1 0 0 we can still solve this problem with its only callback push javascript the function that will initialize your snap js instance var dosnap function if window snapper snap js already exists we just need to re bind events window snapper enable else initialize snap js window snapper new snap element document getelementbyid content window addeventlistener push dosnap dosnap snap js works on my android device but i cannot scroll the content in my drawers what gives older android devices and iphone as well do not have native support for overflow scrolling to solve this you may use the wonderful library called iscroll transform translate3d breaks my fixed child elements how can i solve this this is a problem with chromium and should be fixed soon i would advise not having your direct children element set to fixed that may possibly solve your problem i am experiencing a weird flicker when the css transform is applied to solve the flicker apply the following css to the element in question css content backface visibility hidden webkit backface visibility hidden chrome and safari moz backface visibility
