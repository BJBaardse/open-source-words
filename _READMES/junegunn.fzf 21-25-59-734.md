advanced topics performance executing external programs preview window tips respecting gitignore git ls tree for fast traversal fish shell license installation fzf project consists of the following components fzf executable fzf tmux script for launching fzf in a tmux pane shell extensions key bindings ctrl t ctrl r and alt c bash zsh fish fuzzy auto completion bash zsh vim neovim plugin you can download fzf executable alone if you dont need the extra stuff using homebrew or linuxbrew you can use homebrew or linuxbrew to install fzf sh brew install fzf to install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion brew prefix opt fzf install using git alternatively you can git clone this repository to any directory and run install script sh git clone depth 1 https github com junegunn fzf git fzf fzf install as vim plugin once you have fzf installed you can enable it inside vim simply by adding the directory to runtimepath in your vim configuration file as follows vim if installed using homebrew set rtp usr local opt fzf if installed using git set rtp fzf if you use vim plug the same can be written as vim if installed using homebrew plug usr local opt fzf if installed using git plug fzf but instead of separately installing fzf on your system using homebrew or git clone and enabling it on vim adding it to runtimepath you can use vim plug to do both vim pluginstall and plugupdate will clone fzf in fzf and run install script plug junegunn fzf dir fzf do install all both options are optional you dont have to install fzf in fzf and you dont have to run install script if you use fzf only in vim arch linux sh sudo pacman s fzf fedora fzf is available in fedora 26 and above and can be installed using the usual method sh sudo dnf install fzf shell completion and plugins for vim or neovim are enabled by default shell key bindings are installed but not enabled by default see fedoras package documentation usr share doc fzf readme fedora for more information windows pre built binaries for windows can be downloaded here fzf is also available as a chocolatey package sh choco install fzf however other components of the project may not work on windows known issues and limitations can be found on the wiki page you might want to consider installing fzf on windows subsystem for linux where everything runs flawlessly upgrading fzf fzf is being actively developed and you might want to upgrade it once in a while please follow the instruction below depending on the installation method used git cd fzf git pull install brew brew update brew reinstall fzf chocolatey choco upgrade fzf vim plug plugupdate fzf building fzf see build md usage fzf will launch interactive finder read the list from stdin and write the selected item to stdout sh find type f fzf selected without stdin pipe fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files excluding hidden ones you can override the default command with fzf default command sh vim fzf using the finder ctrl j ctrl k or ctrl n ctrl p to move cursor up and down enter key to select the item ctrl c ctrl g esc to exit on multi select mode m tab and shift tab to mark multiple items emacs style key bindings mouse scroll click double click shift click and shift scroll on multi select mode layout fzf by default starts in fullscreen mode but you can make it start below the cursor with height option sh vim fzf height 40 also check out reverse and layout options if you prefer top down layout instead of the default bottom up layout sh vim fzf height 40 reverse you can add these options to fzf default opts so that theyre applied by default for example sh export fzf default opts height 40 layout reverse border search syntax unless otherwise specified fzf starts in extended search mode where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces e g music mp3 sbtrkt fire token match type description sbtrkt fuzzy match items that match sbtrkt wild exact match quoted items that include wild music prefix exact match items that start with music mp3 suffix exact match items that end with mp3 fire inverse exact match items that do not include fire music inverse prefix exact match items that do not start with music mp3 inverse suffix exact match items that do not end with mp3 if you dont prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to quote every word start fzf with e or exact option note that when exact is set prefix unquotes the term a single bar character term acts as an or operator for example the following query matches entries that start with core and end with either go rb or py core go rb py environment variables fzf default command default command to use when input is tty e g export fzf default command fd type f fzf default opts default options e g export fzf default opts layout reverse inline info options see the man page man fzf for the full list of options examples many useful examples can be found on the wiki page feel free to add your own as well fzf tmux script fzf tmux is a bash script that opens fzf in a tmux pane sh usage fzf tmux u d height l r width fzf options udlr up down left right select git branches in horizontal split below 15 lines git branch fzf tmux d 15 select multiple words in vertical split on the left 20 of screen width cat usr share dict words fzf tmux l 20 multi reverse it will still work even when youre not on tmux silently ignoring udlr options so you can invariably use fzf tmux in your scripts alternatively you can use height height option not to start fzf in fullscreen mode sh fzf height 40 key bindings for command line the install script will setup the following key bindings for bash zsh and fish ctrl t paste the selected files and directories onto the command line set fzf ctrl t command to override the default command set fzf ctrl t opts to pass additional options ctrl r paste the selected command from history onto the command line if you want to see the commands in chronological order press ctrl r again which toggles sorting by relevance set fzf ctrl r opts to pass additional options alt c cd into the selected directory set fzf alt c command to override the default command set fzf alt c opts to pass additional options if youre on a tmux session you can start fzf in a split pane by setting fzf tmux to 1 and change the height of the pane with fzf tmux height e g 20 50 if you use vi mode on bash you need to add set o vi before source fzf bash in your bashrc so that it correctly sets up key bindings for vi mode more tips can be found on the wiki page fuzzy completion for bash and zsh files and directories fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before the cursor ends with the trigger sequence which is by default command directory fuzzy pattern tab sh files under current directory you can select multiple items with tab key vim files under parent directory vim files under parent directory that match fzf vim fzf files under your home directory vim directories under current directory single selection cd directories under github that match fzf cd github fzf process ids fuzzy completion for pids is provided for kill command in this case there is no trigger sequence just press tab key after kill command sh can select multiple processes with or keys kill 9 host names for ssh and telnet commands fuzzy completion for host names is provided the names are extracted from etc hosts and ssh config sh ssh tab telnet tab environment variables aliases sh unset tab export tab unalias tab settings sh use as the trigger sequence instead of the default export fzf completion trigger options to fzf command export fzf completion opts c x use fd https github com sharkdp fd instead of the default find command for listing path candidates the first argument to the function 1 is the base path to start traversal see the source code completion bash zsh for the details fzf compgen path fd hidden follow exclude git 1 use fd to generate the list for directory completion fzf compgen dir fd type d hidden follow exclude git 1 supported commands on bash fuzzy completion is enabled only for a predefined set of commands complete grep fzf to see the list but you can enable it for other commands as well like follows sh complete f fzf path completion o default o bashdefault ag complete f fzf dir completion o default o bashdefault tree vim plugin see readme vim md advanced topics performance fzf is fast and is getting even faster performance should not be a problem in most use cases however you might want to be aware of the options that affect the performance ansi tells fzf to extract and parse ansi color codes in the input and it makes the initial scanning slower so its not recommended that you add it to your fzf default opts nth makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize each line with nth makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize and reassemble each line if you absolutely need better performance you can consider using algo v1 the default being v2 to make fzf use faster greedy algorithm however this algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal ordering of the matches and is not recommended executing external programs you can set up key bindings for starting external processes without leaving fzf execute execute silent bash press f1 to open the file with less without leaving fzf press ctrl y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts fzf requires pbcopy fzf bind f1 execute less f ctrl y execute silent echo pbcopy abort see key bindings section of the man page for details preview window when preview option is set fzf automatically starts external process with the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window bash is replaced to the single quoted string of the focused line fzf preview cat since preview window is updated only after the process is complete its important that the command finishes quickly bash use head instead of cat so that the command doesnt take too long to finish fzf preview head 100 preview window supports ansi colors so you can use programs that syntax highlights the content of a file highlight http www andre simon de doku highlight en highlight php coderay http coderay rubychan de rouge https github com jneen rouge bash try highlight coderay rougify in turn then fall back to cat fzf preview file mime binary echo is a binary file highlight o ansi l coderay rougify cat 2 dev null head 500 you can customize the size and position of the preview window using preview window option for example bash fzf height 40 reverse preview file preview window down 1 for more advanced examples see key bindings for git with fzf tips respecting gitignore you can use fd ripgrep or the silver searcher instead of the default find command to traverse the file system while respecting gitignore sh feed the output of fd into fzf fd type f fzf setting fd as the default source for fzf export fzf default command fd type f now fzf w o pipe will use fd instead of find fzf to apply the command to ctrl t as well export fzf ctrl t command fzf default command if you want the command to follow symbolic links and dont want it to exclude hidden files use the following command sh export fzf default command fd type f hidden follow exclude git git ls tree for fast traversal if youre running fzf in a large git repository git ls tree can boost up the speed of the traversal sh export fzf default command git ls tree r name only head find path \ prune o type f print o type l print sed s 2 dev null fish shell fish shell before version 2 6 0 doesnt allow reading from stdin in command substitution which means simple vim fzf doesnt work as expected the workaround for fish 2 5 0 and earlier is to use the read fish command sh fzf read l result and vim result or for multiple results sh fzf m while read l r set result result r end and vim result the globbing system is different in fish and thus completion will not work however the ctrl t command will use the last token on the commandline as the root folder for the recursive search for instance hitting ctrl t at the end of the following commandline sh ls var will list all files and folders under var when using a custom fzf ctrl t command use the unexpanded dir variable to make use of this feature dir defaults to when the last token is not a valid directory example sh set g fzf ctrl t command command find l \ dir
