this library provides an async image downloader with cache support for convenience we added categories for ui elements like uiimageview uibutton mkannotationview features x categories for uiimageview uibutton mkannotationview adding web image and cache management x an asynchronous image downloader x an asynchronous memory disk image caching with automatic cache expiration handling x a background image decompression x a guarantee that the same url wont be downloaded several times x a guarantee that bogus urls wont be retried again and again x a guarantee that main thread will never be blocked x performances x use gcd and arc supported image formats image formats supported by uiimage jpeg png including gif webp format including animated webp use the webp subspec requirements ios 7 0 or later tvos 9 0 or later watchos 2 0 or later macos 10 9 or later xcode 7 3 or later backwards compatibility for ios 5 and 6 use any 3 x version up to 3 7 6 for ios 5 0 please use the last 2 0 version getting started read this readme doc read the how to use section read the documentation cocoadocs try the example by downloading the project from github or even easier using cocoapods try pod try sdwebimage read the installation guide read the sdwebimage 4 0 migration guide to get an idea of the changes from 3 x to 4 x read the common problems to find the solution for common problems go to the wiki page for more information such as advanced usage who uses it find out who uses sdwebimage and add your app to the list communication if you need help use stack overflow tag sdwebimage if youd like to ask a general question use stack overflow if you found a bug open an issue if you have a feature request open an issue if you want to contribute submit a pull request how to use objective c objective c import imageview sd setimagewithurl nsurl urlwithstring http www domain com path to image jpg placeholderimage uiimage imagenamed placeholder png swift swift import sdwebimage imageview sd setimage with url string http www domain com path to image jpg placeholderimage uiimage named placeholder png for details about how to use the library and clear examples see the detailed how to use animated images gif support starting with the 4 0 version we rely on flanimatedimage to take care of our animated images if you use cocoapods add pod sdwebimage gif to your podfile to use it simply make sure you use flanimatedimageview instead of uiimageview note there is a backwards compatible feature so if you are still trying to load a gif into a uiimageview it will only show the 1st frame as a static image by default however you can enable the full gif support by using the built in gif coder see gif coder important flanimatedimage only works on the ios platform for macos use nsimageview with animates set to yes to show the entire animated images and no to only show the 1st frame for all the other platforms tvos watchos we will fallback to the backwards compatibility feature described above installation there are three ways to use sdwebimage in your project using cocoapods using carthage by cloning the project into your repository installation with cocoapods cocoapods is a dependency manager for objective c which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd party libraries in your projects see the get started section for more details podfile platform ios 7 0 pod sdwebimage 4 0 if you are using swift be sure to add use frameworks and set your target to ios 8 platform ios 8 0 use frameworks subspecs there are 4 subspecs available now core mapkit gif and webp this means you can install only some of the sdwebimage modules by default you get just core so if you need webp you need to specify it podfile example pod sdwebimage webp installation with carthage ios 8 carthage is a lightweight dependency manager for swift and objective c it leverages cocoatouch modules and is less invasive than cocoapods to install with carthage follow the instruction on carthage cartfile github rs sdwebimage installation by cloning the repository see manual install import headers in your source files in the source files where you need to use the library import the header file objective c import build project at this point your workspace should build without error if you are having problem post to the issue and the community can help you solve it author olivier poitrey collaborators konstantinos k bogdan poplauschi chester liu dreampiggy wu zhong licenses all source code is licensed under the mit license architecture
