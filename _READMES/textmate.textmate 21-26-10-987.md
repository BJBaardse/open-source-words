textmate download you can download textmate from here feedback you can use the textmate mailing list or textmate irc channel on freenode net for questions comments and bug reports you can also contact macromates before you submit a bug report please read the writing bug reports instructions screenshot building bootstrap to bootstrap the build you need to run configure in the root of the source tree you can set a few environment variables read by this script that change the generated build file builddir — location of built files defaults to build textmate identity — for apples codesign defaults to ad hoc signing which does not use an identity at all boostdir — location of boost includes by default it will search various locations including macports and homebrew sparsedir — location of sparsehash includes by default it will search various locations including macports and homebrew cc and cxx — c and c compiler in the simplest case assuming homebrew is installed you would run brew install ragel boost multimarkdown hg ninja capnp google sparsehash libressl git clone recursive https github com textmate textmate git cd textmate configure ninja if youre using macports then instead run this line to install dependencies sudo port install ninja ragel boost multimarkdown mercurial sparsehash libressl unless youre using homebrew then capn proto must be manually installed feel free to submit a pr to update configure if port fails with a build error then likely you need to agree system wide to apples xcode license sudo xcodebuild license prerequisites building textmate has the following dependencies ninja — build system similar to make ragel — state machine compiler boost — portable c source libraries sparsehash — a cache friendly hash map multimarkdown — marked up plain text compiler mercurial — distributed scm system capn proto — serialization library libressl openbsd fork of openssl in practice hg mercurial is only required for the scm librarys tests so you can skip this dependency if you dont mind a failing test if you want to avoid the libressl linker warnings about being built for different deployment target then run brew edit libressl and make the following change system configure args system env ldflags mmacosx version min 10 8 cflags mmacosx version min 10 8 configure args afterward you must rebuild using brew reinstall build from source libressl building from within textmate you should install the ninja bundle which can be installed via preferences → bundles after this you can press ⌘b to build from within textmate in case you havent already you also need to set up the path variable either in preferences → variables or tm properties so it can find ninja and related tools an example could be path opt local bin the default target is textmate run this will relaunch textmate but when called from within textmate a dialog will appear before the current instance is killed as there is full session restore it is safe to relaunch even with unsaved changes if the current file is a test file then the target to build is changed to build the library to which the test belongs this is done by setting tm ninja target in the tm properties file found in the root of the source tree similarly if the current file belongs to an application target other than textmate app then tm ninja target is set to build and run this application build targets the build system classifies a target either as a library or an application the latter can either be a bundled or non bundled application e g mate is non bundled just a mate executable where textmate app is a bundled application for each output there are a few symbolic targets you can build while the examples below refer to a specific library or application they exist for all targets of same type for the io library ninja io build the io library and run tests ninja io clean remove the build folder for the io library ninja io headers copy exported headers to builddir include for the mate non bundled application ninja mate build the mate executable ninja mate run build and run the mate executable ninja mate clean remove the build folder for the mate executable for the textmate app application ninja textmate build and sign textmate app ninja textmate run build sign and run textmate app ninja textmate clean remove the build folder for textmate app ninja textmate dsym create a tarball with extracted dsym files ninja textmate tbz create a tarball of textmate app also produce the dsym tarball ninja textmate deploy push a nightly build fails without proper credentials note that ninja textmate clean only cleans the textmate build folder builddir applications textmate but all libraries and applications it depends on are not cleaned to clean everything run ninja t clean legal the source for textmate is released under the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 3 of the license or at your option any later version textmate is a trademark of allan odgaard
