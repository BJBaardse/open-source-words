convnetjs convnetjs is a javascript implementation of neural networks together with nice browser based demos it currently supports common neural network modules fully connected layers non linearities classification svm softmax and regression l2 cost functions ability to specify and train convolutional networks that process images an experimental reinforcement learning module based on deep q learning for much more information see the main page at convnetjs com note i am not actively maintaining convnetjs anymore because i simply dont have time i think the npm repo might not work at this point online demos convolutional neural network on mnist digits convolutional neural network on cifar 10 toy 2d data toy 1d regression training an autoencoder on mnist digits deep q learning reinforcement learning demo image regression painting comparison of sgd adagrad adadelta on mnist example code heres a minimum example of defining a 2 layer neural network and training it on a single data point javascript species a 2 layer neural network with one hidden layer of 20 neurons var layer defs input layer declares size of input here 2 d data convnetjs works on 3 dimensional volumes sx sy depth but if youre not dealing with images then the first two dimensions sx sy will always be kept at size 1 layer defs push type input out sx 1 out sy 1 out depth 2 declare 20 neurons followed by relu rectified linear unit non linearity layer defs push type fc num neurons 20 activation relu declare the linear classifier on top of the previous hidden layer layer defs push type softmax num classes 10 var net new convnetjs net net makelayers layer defs forward a random data point through the network var x new convnetjs vol 0 3 0 5 var prob net forward x prob is a vol vols have a field w that stores the raw data and dw that stores gradients console log probability that x is class 0 prob w 0 prints 0 50101 var trainer new convnetjs sgdtrainer net learning rate 0 01 l2 decay 0 001 trainer train x 0 train the network specifying that x is class zero var prob2 net forward x console log probability that x is class 0 prob2 w 0 now prints 0 50374 slightly higher than previous 0 50101 the networks weights have been adjusted by the trainer to give a higher probability to the class we trained the network with zero and here is a small convolutional neural network if you wish to predict on images javascript var layer defs layer defs push type input out sx 32 out sy 32 out depth 3 declare size of input output vol is of size 32x32x3 here layer defs push type conv sx 5 filters 16 stride 1 pad 2 activation relu the layer will perform convolution with 16 kernels each of size 5x5 the input will be padded with 2 pixels on all sides to make the output vol of the same size output vol will thus be 32x32x16 at this point layer defs push type pool sx 2 stride 2 output vol is of size 16x16x16 here layer defs push type conv sx 5 filters 20 stride 1 pad 2 activation relu output vol is of size 16x16x20 here layer defs push type pool sx 2 stride 2 output vol is of size 8x8x20 here layer defs push type conv sx 5 filters 20 stride 1 pad 2 activation relu output vol is of size 8x8x20 here layer defs push type pool sx 2 stride 2 output vol is of size 4x4x20 here layer defs push type softmax num classes 10 output vol is of size 1x1x10 here net new convnetjs net net makelayers layer defs helpful utility for converting images into vols is included var x convnetjs img to vol document getelementbyid some image var output probabilities vol net forward x getting started a getting started tutorial is available on main page the full documentation can also be found there see the releases page for this project to get the minified compiled library and a direct link to is also available below for convenience but please host your own copy convnet js convnet min js compiling the library from src to build if you would like to add features to the library you will have to change the code in src and then compile the library into the build directory the compilation script simply concatenates files in src and then minifies the result the compilation is done using an ant task it compiles build convnet js by concatenating the source files in src and then minifies the result into build convnet min js make sure you have ant installed on ubuntu you can simply sudo apt get install it then cd into compile directory and run ant lib yuicompressor 2 4 8 jar f build xml the output files will be in build use in node the library is also available on node js install it npm install convnetjs use it var convnetjs require convnetjs license mit
