two js a two dimensional drawing api meant for modern browsers it is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to render in multiple contexts webgl canvas2d and svg home • examples • documentation • help usage download the latest minified library and include it in your html html script src js two min js script it can also be installed via npm js npm install save two js alternatively see how to build the library yourself here is boilerplate html in order to draw a spinning rectangle in two js html doctype html html head meta charset utf 8 script src js two min js script head body script var

two js uses nodejs in order to build source files youll first want to install that once installed open up a terminal and head to the repository folder cd path to repo two js npm install this will give you a number of libraries that the development of two js relies on if for instance you only use the svgrenderer then you can really cut down on the file size by excluding the other renderers to do this modify utils build js to only add the files youd like then run node utils build and the resulting build two js and build two min js will be updated to your specification running in headless environments as of version v0 7 0 two js can also run in a headless environment namely running on the server with the help of a library called node canvas we dont add node canvas to dependencies of two js because its not necessary to run it in the browser however it has all the hooks setup to run in a cloud environment to get started follow the installation instructions on automattics readme after youve done that run npm install canvas now in a javascript file setup your two js scenegraph and save out frames whenever you need to javascript var two require build two js or from npm require

nightly december 1 2017 v0 7 0 alpha 1 fixed closed two path getpointat method to clamp properly added two texture repeat for describing pattern invocations added two texture two sprite and two imagesequence removed two shape inheritance for two gradients added two vector rotate method ferm10n objects clone to parent only if parent exists ferm10n vendor agnostic requestanimationframe ferm10n two utils events listento and two utils events stoplistening ferm10n two utils events added to two path prototype for event inheritance ferm10n enhanced two shape scale to allow both numbers and two vector as property value made two interpret use latest primitives added two circle primitive two shape translation is now a getter setter and can be replaced fixed translation interpretation to strip out px strings removed two sinering — make two star curved true and its the same effect enhanced two arcsegment two ellipse two polygon two rectangle two roundedrectangle two star fixed two anchor relative interpretation in svg canvas and webgl renderers made getters setters enumerable for iteration compatibility fixed two utils collection splice method and added additional test added compatibility with node js browserify and node canvas removed third party dependencies added remove method to two text fixed ordering on same parent additions for two group february 9 2016 v0 6 0 updated two canvasrenderer ctx imagesmoothingenabled to not use deprecated invokation issue 178 fixed two group mask in svgrenderer to append to dom correctly updated require imports to be compatible with require js added two text for programmatically writing text in two js october 1 2015 v0 5 0 added support for two interpret to import svgs gradients added two utils xhr and two load methods to asynchronously load svg files added two gradient two lineargradient and two radialgradient added dependency check to ensure asm loading in environments like npm as well as in the browser properly deleted webgl textures on removal of two path added support for two interpret to import svgs elliptical arcs added two arcsegment and two sinering as new shapes invoked like two path chrisdelbuck added two line two rectangle two roundedrectangle two ellipse two polygon and two star as new shapes invoked like two path breaking renamed two polygon to two path performance enhancements to webgl renderer performance enhancements to canvas renderer leo koppelkamm enabled render ordering in two group children based on previous augmentation augmented two group children to inherit from two collection effectively making it an array instead of a map leo koppelkamm the map can still be accessed at two group children ids july 22 2014 v0 4 0 updated two interpret to handle polybezier path data added two group mask and two polygon clip in order to create clipping masks two group has own opacity property leo koppelkamm rendering optimizations leo koppelkamm two noconflict non destructive command internally to the library two interpret decomposes transform attribute of source tag two interpret handles item irregularities from inkscape changed two identifier to use underscores instead of hyphens for dot notation access leo koppelkamm added two group getbyid and two group getbyclassname methods for convenient selection leo koppelkamm added classlist to all two shapes leo koppelkamm enabled inference of applied styles on imported svgs leo koppelkamm added two polygon getpointat method to get coordinates on a curve line added two polygon length property and two polygon updatelength method to calculate length of curve line updated two group prototype observable properties on two polygon properties to ensure each property is considered unique two polygon vertices first and last vertex create automated control points when two polygon curved true updated two polygon subdivide method to accommodate two makeellipse enabled id to be properly interpreted from svg elements chrisdelbuck updated webgl renderer getboundingclientrect to accommodate relative anchors updated beginning and ending to clamp to each other reorganized two polygon update and two polygon plot in order to handle beginning and ending properties updated two getcomputedmatrix and two polygon getboundingclientrect to adhere to nested transformations updated two anchor to change control points relatively by default through anchor relative property updated two polygon subdivide method to accommodate curved false circumstances updated svg canvas and webgl renderers to properly reflect holes in curved two polygons updated two group clone method added toobject method to two group two polygon two anchor two polygon initializes polygon cap butt and polygon join miter based on adobe illustrator defaults two polygon subdivide method now works with two commands move for noncontiguous polygons internally update matrices on getboundingclientrect in order to remove the need to defer or wait for internal variables to be up to date refactor of renderers and scenegraph for performance optimization and lower memory footprint relinquished internal events for flags prototypical declaration of object defineproperty added update and flagreset methods to two shape two group and two polygon decoupled canvas and webgl renderers and are now independent added matrix manual to override the default behavior of a two polygon transformation localized variables per file as much as possible to reduce garbage collection on runtime october 25 2013 v0 3 0 can properly pass domelement on construction of new instance of two added overdraw boolean to webgl renderer arodic added support for ie9 svg interpretation tomconroy added subdivide method for two polygon and two group ensure sure that manual properly is set on construction of two polygon that it binds two anchor controls change events added automatic high dpi support for webgl renderer updated two interpret svg to handle compound paths added two anchor which represents all anchor points drawn in two js modified source to not have any instances of window for node use updated to underscore js 1 5 1 added two utils getreflection method to properly get reflections in svg interpretation made two vector inherently not broadcast events and now needs to be explicity bound to in order to broadcast events which two js does internally for you created two utils collection an observable array like class that polygon vertices inherit fchasen added two events insert and two events remove for use with two utils collection properly recurses getboundingclientrect for both two group and two polygon added two version to clarify forthcoming builds updated hierarchy ordering of group children in canvas and webgl renderers updated shallow and bidirectional remove method for two group and two polygon added corner method to two group and two polygon allowing anchoring along the upper lefthand corner of the form modified center method of two group and two polygon to not affect the translation property to stay inline with corner method and any future orientation and anchoring logic added automatic high dpi support for canvas renderer added overdraw boolean to canvas renderer added amd loader compatibility thomasrudin deferred two update to account for canvas and webgl added remove and clear methods to two instance updated svg interpretation for webgl context added matrix property to all two shapes for advanced transformations added inverse method to two matrix remove execution path dependency on utils build js masonblier added timedelta property to every two instance added gruntfile package json for more integration with npm and dependency free build build two clean js iros crossbrowser compatibility with nostroke and nofill commands may 3 2013 v0 2 0 first alpha release jan 29 2013 v0 1 0 alpha proof of concept built from three js
