about wifiphisher is a security tool that performs wi fi automatic association attacks to force wireless clients to unknowingly connect to an attacker controlled access point it is a rogue access point framework that can be used to mount automated victim customized phishing attacks against wifi clients in order to obtain credentials or infect the victims with malwares it can work as social engineering attack tool that unlike other methods it does not include any brute forcing it is an easy way for obtaining credentials from captive portals and third party login pages e g in social networks or wpa wpa2 pre shared keys wifiphisher works on kali linux and is licensed under the gpl license how it works after achieving a man in the middle position using wi fi automatic association techniques including karma and known beacons attacks wifiphisher by default redirects all http requests to an attacker controlled phishing page from the victims perspective the attack makes use in three phases victim is being deauthenticated from her access point wifiphisher continuously jams all of the target access points wifi devices within range by forging “deauthenticate” or “disassociate” packets to disrupt existing associations victim joins a rogue access point wifiphisher sniffs the area and copies the target access points settings it then creates a rogue wireless access point that is modeled by the target it also sets up a nat dhcp server and forwards the right ports consequently because of the deauth attack and the automatic association techniques clients will eventually start connecting to the rogue access point after this phase the victim is mitmed victim is being served a realistic specially customized phishing page wifiphisher employs a minimal web server that responds to http https requests as soon as the victim requests a page from the internet wifiphisher will respond with a realistic fake page that asks for credentials or serves malwares this page will be specifically crafted for the victim for example a router config looking page will contain the brand of the victims vendor the tool supports community built templates for different phishing scenarios performing mitm attack requirements following are the requirements for getting the most out of wifiphisher kali linux although people have made wifiphisher work on other distros kali linux is the officially supported distribution thus all new features are primarily tested on this platform one wireless network adapter that supports ap monitor mode and is capable of injection for advanced mode you need two cards one that supports ap mode and another that supports monitor mode drivers should support netlink installation to install the latest development version type the following commands bash git clone https github com wifiphisher wifiphisher git download the latest revision cd wifiphisher switch to tools directory sudo python setup py install install any dependencies alternatively you can download the latest stable version from the releases page usage run the tool by typing wifiphisher or python bin wifiphisher from inside the tools directory by running the tool without any options it will find the right interfaces and interactively ask the user to pick the essid of the target network out of a list with all the essids in the around area as well as a phishing scenario to perform by default the tool will perform both evil twin and karma attacks shell wifiphisher ai wlan0 ji wlan4 p firmware upgrade handshake capture handshake pcap use wlan0 for spawning the rogue access point and wlan4 for dos attacks select the target network manually from the list and perform the firmware upgrade scenario verify that the captured pre shared key is correct by checking it against the handshake in the handshake pcap file useful for manually selecting the wireless adapters the firmware upgrade scenario is an easy way for obtaining the psk from a password protected network shell wifiphisher essid conference wifi p plugin update pk s3cr3tp4ssw0rd automatically pick the right interfaces target the wi fi with essid conference wifi and perform the plugin update scenario the evil twin will be password protected with psk s3cr3tp4ssw0rd useful against networks with disclosed psks e g in conferences the plugin update scenario provides an easy way for getting the victims to download malicious executables e g malwares containing a reverse shell payload shell wifiphisher noextensions essid free wi fi p oauth login kb do not load any extensions simply spawn an open wi fi network with essid free wi fi and perform the oauth login scenario use the known beacons wi fi automatic association technique useful against victims in public areas the oauth login scenario provides a simple way for capturing credentials from social networks like facebook following are all the options along with their descriptions also available with wifiphisher h short form

dont know how to code you can help us by proposing improvements or reporting bugs please have a look at the bug reporting guidelines and the faq document beforehand note that the tool does not aim to be script kiddie friendly make sure you do understand how the tool works before opening an issue credits the script is based on an idea from dan mcinerney back in 2015 a full list of contributors lies
