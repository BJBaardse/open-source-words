tflearn deep learning library featuring a higher level api for tensorflow tflearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of tensorflow it was designed to provide a higher level api to tensorflow in order to facilitate and speed up experimentations while remaining fully transparent and compatible with it tflearn features include easy to use and understand high level api for implementing deep neural networks with tutorial and examples fast prototyping through highly modular built in neural network layers regularizers optimizers metrics full transparency over tensorflow all functions are built over tensors and can be used independently of tflearn powerful helper functions to train any tensorflow graph with support of multiple inputs outputs and optimizers easy and beautiful graph visualization with details about weights gradients activations and more effortless device placement for using multiple cpu gpu the high level api currently supports most of recent deep learning models such as convolutions lstm birnn batchnorm prelu residual networks generative networks in the future tflearn is also intended to stay up to date with latest deep learning techniques note latest tflearn v0 3 is only compatible with tensorflow v1 0 and over overview python classification tflearn init graph num cores 8 gpu memory fraction 0 5 net tflearn input data shape none 784 net tflearn fully connected net 64 net tflearn dropout net 0 5 net tflearn fully connected net 10 activation softmax net tflearn regression net optimizer adam loss categorical crossentropy model tflearn dnn net model fit x y python sequence generation net tflearn input data shape none 100 5000 net tflearn lstm net 64 net tflearn dropout net 0 5 net tflearn fully connected net 5000 activation softmax net tflearn regression net optimizer adam loss categorical crossentropy model tflearn sequencegenerator net dictionary idx seq maxlen 100 model fit x y model generate 50 temperature 1 0 there are many more examples available here installation tensorflow installation tflearn requires tensorflow version 1 0 to be installed to install tensorflow simply run pip install tensorflow or with gpu support pip install tensorflow gpu for more details see tensorflow installation instructions tflearn installation to install tflearn the easiest way is to run for the bleeding edge version recommended python pip install git https github com tflearn tflearn git for the latest stable version python pip install tflearn otherwise you can also install from source by running from source folder python python setup py install for more details please see the installation guide getting started see getting started with tflearn to learn about tflearn basic functionalities or start browsing tflearn tutorials examples there are many neural network implementation available see examples documentation http tflearn org doc index model visualization graph loss accuracy multiple runs layers contributions this is the first release of tflearn if you find any bug please report it in the github issues section improvements and requests for new features are more than welcome do not hesitate to twist and tweak tflearn and send pull requests for more info contribute to tflearn license mit license
