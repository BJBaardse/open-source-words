js script script reveal initialize script body html the presentation markup hierarchy needs to be reveal slides section where the section represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely if you place multiple section elements inside of another section they will be shown as vertical slides the first of the vertical slides is the root of the others at the top and will be included in the horizontal sequence for example html div class reveal div class slides section single horizontal slide section section section vertical slide 1 section section vertical slide 2 section section div div markdown its possible to write your slides using markdown to enable markdown add the data markdown attribute to your section elements and wrap the contents in a textarea data template like the example below youll also need to add the plugin markdown marked js and plugin markdown markdown js scripts in that order to your html file this is based on data markdown from paul irish modified to use marked to support github flavored markdown sensitive to indentation avoid mixing tabs and spaces and line breaks avoid consecutive breaks html page title a paragraph with some text and a link http hakim se textarea external markdown you can write your content as a separate file and have reveal js load it at runtime note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file the data separator attribute defines a regular expression for horizontal slides defaults to \r \n \r \n a newline bounded horizontal rule and data separator vertical defines vertical slides disabled by default the data separator notes attribute is a regular expression for specifying the beginning of the current slides speaker notes defaults to notes so it will match both note and notes the data charset attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file when used locally this feature requires that reveal js runs from a local web server the following example customises all available options html section data markdown example md data separator \n\n\n data separator vertical \n\n data separator notes note data charset iso 8859 15 note that windows uses \r\n instead of \n as its linefeed character for a regex that supports all operating systems use \r \n instead of \n section element attributes special syntax through html comments is

doesnt rely on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default these libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear for example javascript reveal initialize dependencies cross browser shim that fully implements classlist https github com eligrey classlist js src lib js classlist js condition function return document body classlist interpret markdown in section elements src plugin markdown marked js condition function return document queryselector data markdown src plugin markdown markdown js condition function return document

available for each dependency object src path to the script to load async optional flags if the script should load after reveal js has started defaults to false callback optional function to execute when the script has loaded condition optional function which must return true for the script to be loaded to load these dependencies reveal js requires head js a script loading library to be loaded before reveal js ready event a ready event is fired when reveal js has loaded all non async dependencies and is ready to start navigating to check if reveal js is already ready you can call reveal isready javascript reveal addeventlistener ready function event event currentslide event indexh event indexv note that we also add a ready class to the reveal element so that you can hook into this with css auto sliding presentations can be configured to progress through slides automatically without any user input to enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides javascript slide every five seconds reveal configure autoslide 5000 when this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto sliding alternatively sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing »a« on the keyboard sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating you can disable these controls by specifying autoslidestoppable false in your reveal js config you can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data autoslide attribute html section data autoslide 2000 p after 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown p p class fragment data autoslide 10000 after 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown p p class fragment now the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown p section to override the method used for navigation when auto sliding you can specify the autoslidemethod setting to only navigate along the top layer and ignore vertical slides set this to reveal navigateright whenever the auto slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired keyboard bindings if youre unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option javascript reveal configure keyboard 13 next go to the next slide when the enter key is pressed 27 function do something custom when esc is pressed 32 null dont do anything when space is pressed i e disable a reveal js default binding touch navigation you can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch enabled device horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides vertical swipes change between vertical slides if you wish to disable this you can set the touch config option to false when initializing reveal js if theres some part of your content that needs to remain accessible to touch events youll need to highlight this by adding a data prevent swipe attribute to the element one common example where this is useful is elements that need to be scrolled lazy loading when working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content its important to load lazily lazy loading means that reveal js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide the number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewdistance configuration option to enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attributes to data src as shown below this is supported for image video audio and iframe elements lazy loaded iframes will also unload when the containing slide is no longer visible html section img data src image png iframe data src http hakim se iframe video source data src video webm type video webm source data src video mp4 type video mp4 video

render function from this callback javascript reveal addeventlistener slidechanged function event event previousslide event currentslide event indexh event indexv presentation state the presentations current state can be fetched by using the getstate method a state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getstate was first called sort of like a

reveal setstate state were back on slide 1 slide states if you set data state somestate on a slide section somestate will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened this allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via javascript javascript reveal addeventlistener somestate function todo sprinkle magic false slide backgrounds slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly you can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data background attribute to your section elements four different types of backgrounds are supported color image video and iframe color backgrounds all css color formats are supported including hex values keywords rgba or hsl html section data background color ff0000 h2 color h2 section image backgrounds by default background images are resized to cover the full page available options attribute default description data background image url of the image to show gifs restart when the slide opens data background size cover see background size

section video backgrounds automatically plays a full size video behind the slide attribute default description data background video a single video source or a comma separated list of video sources data background video loop false flags if the video should play repeatedly data background video muted false flags if the audio should be muted data background size cover use cover for full screen and some cropping or contain for letterboxing html section data background video https s3 amazonaws com static slid es site homepage v1 homepage video editor mp4 https s3 amazonaws com static slid es site homepage v1 homepage video editor webm data background video loop data background video muted h2 video h2 section iframe backgrounds embeds a web page as a slide background that covers 100 of the reveal js width and height the iframe is in the background layer behind your slides and as such its not possible to interact with it by default to make your background interactive you can add the data background interactive attribute html section data background iframe https slides com data background interactive h2 iframe h2 section background transitions backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default this can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundtransition slide to the reveal initialize call alternatively you can set data background transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition parallax background if you want to use a parallax scrolling background set the first two properties below when initializing reveal js the other two are optional javascript reveal initialize parallax background image parallaxbackgroundimage e g https s3 amazonaws com hakim static reveal js reveal parallax 1 jpg parallax background size parallaxbackgroundsize css syntax e g 2100px 900px currently only pixels are supported dont use or auto number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide calculated automatically unless specified set to 0 to disable movement along an axis parallaxbackgroundhorizontal 200 parallaxbackgroundvertical 50 make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling view example slide transitions the global presentation transition is set using the transition config value you can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data transition attribute html this slide will override the presentation transition and zoom choose from three transition speeds default fast or slow you can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide html section data transition slide the train goes on … section section data transition slide and on … section section data transition slide in fade out and stops section section data transition fade in slide out passengers entering and leaving section section data transition slide and it starts again section internal links its easy to link between slides the first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an id attribute section id some slide html a href 2 2 link a a href some slide link a you can also add relative navigation links similar to the built in reveal js controls by appending one of the following classes on any element note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when its a valid navigation route based on the current slide html a href class navigate left a href class navigate right a href class navigate up a href class navigate down a href class navigate prev previous vertical or horizontal slide a href class navigate next next vertical or horizontal slide fragments fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide heres an example http revealjs com fragments the default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in this style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment html section p class fragment grow grow p p class fragment shrink shrink p p class fragment fade out fade out p p class fragment fade up fade up also down left and right p p class fragment current visible visible only once p p class fragment highlight current blue blue only once p p class fragment highlight red highlight red p p class fragment highlight green highlight green p p class fragment highlight blue highlight blue p section multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second html section span class fragment fade in span class fragment fade out ill fade in then out span span section the display order of fragments can be controlled using the data fragment index attribute html section p class fragment data fragment index 3 appears last p p class fragment data fragment index 1 appears first p p class fragment data fragment index 2 appears second p section fragment events when a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal js will dispatch an event some libraries like mathjax see 505 get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback javascript reveal addeventlistener fragmentshown function event event fragment the fragment dom element reveal addeventlistener fragmenthidden function event event fragment the fragment dom element code syntax highlighting by default reveal is configured with highlight js for code syntax highlighting to enable syntax highlighting youll have to load the highlight plugin plugin highlight highlight js and a highlight js css theme reveal comes packaged with the zenburn theme lib css zenburn css javascript reveal initialize more info https github com hakimel reveal js dependencies dependencies src plugin highlight highlight js async true callback function hljs inithighlightingonload below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted when the data trim attribute is present surrounding whitespace is automatically removed html will be escaped by default to avoid this for example if you are using mark to call out a line of code add the data noescape attribute to the code element html section pre code data trim data noescape def lazy fib concat 0 1 mark fn rfib a b mark lazy cons a b rfib b a b 0 1 code pre section slide number if you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slidenumber and showslidenumber configuration values javascript shows the slide number using default formatting reveal configure slidenumber true slide number formatting can be configured using these variables h v horizontal vertical slide number default h v horizontal vertical slide number c flattened slide number c t flattened slide number total slides reveal configure slidenumber c t control which views the slide number displays on using the showslidenumber value all show on all views default speaker only show slide numbers on speaker notes view print only show slide numbers when printing to pdf reveal configure showslidenumber speaker overview mode press »esc« or »o« keys to toggle the overview mode on and off while youre in this mode you can still navigate between slides as if you were at 1

toggle the overview mode programmatically reveal toggleoverview fullscreen mode just press »f« on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode press the »esc« key to exit fullscreen mode embedded media add data autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown html video data autoplay src http clips vorwaerts gmbh de big buck bunny mp4 video if you want to enable or disable autoplay globally for all embedded media you can use the autoplaymedia configuration option if you set this to true all media will autoplay regardless of individual data autoplay attributes if you initialize with autoplaymedia false no media will autoplay note that embedded html5 video audio and youtube vimeo iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide this can be disabled by decorating your element with a data ignore attribute embedded iframes reveal js automatically pushes two post messages to embedded iframes slide start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide stop when it is hidden stretching elements sometimes its desirable to have an element like an image or video stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide this can be done by adding the stretch class to an element as seen below html section h2 this video will use up the remaining space on the slide h2 video class stretch src http clips vorwaerts gmbh de big buck bunny mp4 video section limitations only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched only one descendant per slide section can be stretched postmessage api the framework has a built in postmessage api that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window heres an example showing how youd make a reveal js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2 javascript window postmessage json stringify method slide args 2 when reveal js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent bubbled events are stringified json with three fields namespace eventname and state heres how you subscribe to them from the parent window javascript window addeventlistener message function event var data json parse event data if data namespace reveal data eventname slidechanged slide changed see data state for slide number this cross window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags javascript reveal initialize exposes the reveal js api through window postmessage postmessage true dispatches all reveal js events to the parent window through postmessage postmessageevents false pdf export presentations can be exported to pdf via a special print stylesheet this feature requires that you use google chrome or chromium and to be serving the presentation from a webserver heres an example of an exported presentation thats been uploaded to slideshare http www slideshare net hakimel revealjs 300 page size export dimensions are inferred from the configured presentation size slides that are too tall to fit within a single page will expand onto multiple pages you can limit how many pages a slide may expand onto using the pdfmaxpagesperslide config option for example reveal configure pdfmaxpagesperslide 1 ensures that no slide ever grows to more than one printed page print stylesheet to enable the pdf print capability in your presentation the special print stylesheet at css print pdf css must be loaded the default index html file handles this for you when print pdf is included in the query string if youre using a different html template you can add this to your head html script var link document createelement link link rel stylesheet link type text css link href window location search match print pdf gi css print pdf css css

want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here css theme readme md speaker notes reveal js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per slide notes in a separate browser window the notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you havent written any notes press the »s« key on your keyboard to open the notes window a speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened you can reset it to 00 00 00 at any time by simply clicking tapping on it notes are defined by appending an aside element to a slide as seen below you can add the data markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using markdown alternatively you can add your notes in a data notes attribute on the slide like section data notes something important section when used locally this feature requires that reveal js runs from a local web server html some slide aside class notes oh hey these are some notes theyll be hidden in your presentation but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window hit »s« on your keyboard aside if youre using the external markdown plugin you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter html title sub title here is some content note this will only display in the notes window share and print speaker notes notes are only visible to the speaker inside of the speaker view if you wish to share your notes with others you can initialize reveal js with the shownotes configuration value set to true notes will appear along the bottom of the presentations when shownotes is enabled notes are also included when you export to pdf by default notes are printed in a semi transparent box on top of the slide if youd rather print them on a separate page after the slide set shownotes separate page speaker notes clock and timers the speaker notes window will also show time elapsed since the beginning of the presentation if you hover the mouse above this section a timer reset button will appear current wall clock time optionally a pacing timer which indicates whether the current pace of the presentation is on track for the right timing shown in green and if not whether the presenter should speed up shown in red or has the luxury of slowing down blue the pacing timer can be enabled by configuring by the defaulttiming parameter in the reveal configuration block which specifies the number of seconds per slide 120 can be a reasonable rule of thumb timings can also be given per slide section by setting the data timing attribute both values are in numbers of seconds server side speaker notes in some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one youre presenting on the node js based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies javascript reveal initialize dependencies src socket io socket io js async true src plugin notes server client js async true then install node js 4 0 0 or later run npm install run node plugin notes server multiplexing the multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone tablet or laptop as the master presentation navigates the slides all client presentations will update in real time see a demo at https reveal js multiplex ccjbegmaii now sh the multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate master presentation that has control client presentations that follow the master socket io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients master presentation served from a static file server accessible preferably only to the presenter this need only be on your the presenters computer its safer to run the master presentation from your own computer so if the venues internet goes down it doesnt stop the show an example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation npm install node static static if you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below then execute node plugin notes server in the directory of your master presentation the configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket io server as a master as
