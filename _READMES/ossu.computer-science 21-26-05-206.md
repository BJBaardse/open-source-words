open source society university path to a free self taught education in computer science contents summary curriculum prerequisites introduction to computer science core cs advanced cs final project pro cs code of conduct community how to show your progress team references summary the ossu curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials its not merely for career training or professional development its for those who want a proper well rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines and for those who have the discipline will and most importantly good habits to obtain this education largely on their own but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners it is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors minus general education non cs requirements as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of cs the courses themselves are among the very best in the world often coming from harvard princeton mit etc but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria courses must be open for enrollment run regularly ideally in self paced format otherwise running at least once a month or so fulfill the academic requirements of ossu fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to topics and difficulty level be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles when no course meets the above criteria the coursework is supplemented with a book when there are courses or books that dont fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality they belong in extras courses or extras readings organization the curriculum is designed as follows intro cs for students to try out cs and see if its right for them core cs corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum taking classes that all majors would be required to take advanced cs corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum taking electives according to the students interests final project a project for students to validate consolidate and display their knowledge to be evaluated by their peers worldwide pro cs graduate level specializations students can elect to take after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize their chances of getting a good job duration it is possible to finish core cs within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 18 22 hours week to your studies courses in core cs should be taken linearly if possible but since a perfectly linear progression is rarely possible each classs prerequisites is specified so that you can design a logical but non linear progression based on the class schedules and your own life plans cost all or nearly all course material prior to pro cs is available for free however some courses may charge money for assignments tests projects to be graded note that coursera offers financial aid decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget just remember that you cant purchase success content policy if you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly you must share only files that you are allowed to do not disrespect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of each course how to contribute please see contributing getting help

applications final project pro cs prerequisites core cs assumes the student has already taken high school math and physics including algebra geometry and pre calculus some high school graduates will have already taken ap calculus but this is usually only about 3 4 of a college calculus class so the calculus courses in the curriculum are still recommended advanced cs assumes the student has already taken the entirety of core cs and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take note that advanced systems assumes the student has taken a basic physics course e g ap physics

advanced cs based on interest not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken but students should take every course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into the advanced cs study should then end with one of the specializations under advanced applications a specializations capstone if taken may act as the final project if permitted by the honor code of the course if not or if a student chooses not to take the capstone then a separate final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum advanced programming topics covered debugging theory and practice goal oriented

university is project focused you are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course but what really matters is whether you can use your knowledge to solve a real world problem after youve gotten through all of core cs and the parts of advanced cs relevant to you you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge youve acquired not only does real project work look great on a resume the project will validate and consolidate your knowledge you can create something entirely new or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like codetriage or first timers only another option is using the capstone project from taking one of the specializations in advanced applications whether or not this makes sense depends on the course the project and whether or not the courses honor code permits you to display your work publicly in some cases it may not be permitted do not violate your courses honor code put the ossu cs badge in the readme of your

projects information to projects via a pull request and use our community channels to announce it to your fellow students your peers and mentors from ossu will then informally evaluate your project you will not be graded in the traditional sense â€” everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success the purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist and to get experience listening to feedback â€” both positive and negative â€” and taking it in stride the final project evaluation has a second purpose to evaluate whether ossu through its community and curriculum is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world class computer science education cooperative work you can create this project alone or with other students we love cooperative work use our channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects which programming languages should i use my friend here is the best part of liberty you can use any language that you want to complete the final project the important thing is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool programming language that you wish pro cs after completing the requirements of the curriculum above you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelors degree in computer science or quite close to one you can stop in the advanced cs section but the next step to completing your studies is to develop skills and knowledge in a specific domain many of these courses are graduate level choose one or more of the following specializations mastering software development in r specialization by johns hopkins university artificial intelligence engineer nanodegree by ibm amazon and didi

university to your linkedin and facebook profile ps a forum is an ideal way to interact with other students as we do not lose important discussions which usually occur in communication via chat apps please use our forum for important discussions how to show your progress create an account in trello copy this board to your personal account see how to copy a board here now that you have a copy of our official board you just need to pass the cards to the doing column or done column as you progress in your study we also have labels to help you have more control through the process the meaning of each of these labels is main curriculum cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum extra resources cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student doing cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing done cards with that label represent courses finished by the student those cards should also have the link for at least one project article built with the knowledge acquired in such course section cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum those cards with the section label are only to help the organization of the done column you should put the courses cards below its respective sections card the intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends family employers etc you can change the status of your board to be public or private team curriculum founders eric douglas
