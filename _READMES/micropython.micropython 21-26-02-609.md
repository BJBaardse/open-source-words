the micropython project this is the micropython project which aims to put an implementation of python 3 x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems you can find the official website at micropython org warning this project is in beta stage and is subject to changes of the code base including project wide name changes and api changes micropython implements the entire python 3 4 syntax including exceptions with yield from etc and additionally async await keywords from python 3 5 the following core datatypes are provided str including basic unicode support bytes bytearray tuple list dict set frozenset array array collections namedtuple classes and instances builtin modules include sys time and struct etc select ports have support for thread module multithreading note that only a subset of python 3 functionality is implemented for the data types and modules micropython can execute scripts in textual source form or from precompiled bytecode in both cases either from an on device filesystem or frozen into the micropython executable see the repository http github com micropython pyboard for the micropython board pyboard the officially supported reference electronic circuit board major components in this repository py the core python implementation including compiler runtime and core library mpy cross the micropython cross compiler which is used to turn scripts into precompiled bytecode ports unix a version of micropython that runs on unix ports stm32 a version of micropython that runs on the pyboard and similar stm32 boards using sts cube hal drivers ports minimal a minimal micropython port start with this if you want to port micropython to another microcontroller tests test framework and test scripts docs user documentation in sphinx restructuredtext format rendered html documentation is available at http docs micropython org be sure to select needed board port at the bottom left corner additional components ports bare arm a bare minimum version of micropython for arm mcus used mostly to control code size ports teensy a version of micropython that runs on the teensy 3 1 preliminary but functional ports pic16bit a version of micropython for 16 bit pic microcontrollers ports cc3200 a version of micropython that runs on the cc3200 from ti ports esp8266 an experimental port for esp8266 wifi modules extmod additional non core modules implemented in c tools various tools including the pyboard py module examples a few example python scripts the subdirectories above may include readmes with additional info make is used to build the components or gmake on bsd based systems you will also need bash gcc and python at least 2 7 or 3 3 the unix version the unix port requires a standard unix environment with gcc and gnu make x86 and x64 architectures are supported i e x86 32 and 64 bit as well as arm and mips making full featured port to another architecture requires writing some assembly code for the exception handling and garbage collection alternatively fallback implementation based on setjmp longjmp can be used to build see section below for required dependencies git submodule update init cd ports unix make axtls make then to give it a try micropython list 5 x y for x in range 10 for y in 4 2 1 use ctrl d i e eof to exit the shell learn about command line options in particular how to increase heap size which may be needed for larger applications micropython help run complete testsuite make test unix version comes with a builtin package manager called upip e g micropython m upip install micropython pystone micropython m pystone browse available modules on pypi standard library modules come from micropython lib project external dependencies building micropython ports may require some dependencies installed for unix port libffi library and pkg config tool are required on debian ubuntu mint derivative linux distros install build essential includes toolchain and make libffi dev and pkg config packages other dependencies can be built together with micropython this may be required to enable extra features or capabilities and in recent versions of micropython these may be enabled by default to build these additional dependencies first fetch git submodules for them git submodule update init use the same command to get the latest versions of dependencies as they are updated from time to time after that in the port directory e g ports unix execute make deplibs this will build all available dependencies regardless whether they are used or not if you intend to build micropython with additional options like cross compiling the same set of options should be passed to make deplibs to actually enable disable use of dependencies edit ports unix mpconfigport mk file which has inline descriptions of the options for example to build ssl module required for upip tool described above and so enabled by dfeault micropy py ussl should be set to 1 for some ports building required dependences is transparent and happens automatically they still need to be fetched with the git submodule command above the stm32 version the stm32 port requires an arm compiler arm none eabi gcc and associated bin utils for those using arch linux you need arm none eabi binutils arm none eabi gcc and arm none eabi newlib packages otherwise try here https launchpad net gcc arm embedded to build git submodule update init cd ports stm32 make you then need to get your board into dfu mode on the pyboard connect the 3v3 pin to the p1 dfu pin with a wire on pybv1 0 they are next to each other on the bottom left of the board second row from the bottom then to flash the code via usb dfu to your device make deploy this will use the included tools pydfu py script if flashing the firmware does not work it may be because you dont have the correct permissions and need to use sudo make deploy see the readme md file in the ports stm32 directory for further details contributing micropython is an
