blockskit blocks in c and objective c are downright magical they make coding easier and potentially quicker not to mention faster on the front end with multithreading and grand central dispatch blockskit hopes to facilitate this kind of programming by removing some of the annoying and in some cases impeding limits on coding with blocks blockskit is a framework for os x mountain lion and newer a static library for ios 6 and ios 7 and a framework for ios 8 and newer blockskit was created by zachary waldowski and alexsander akers and is maintained by the former installation blockskit can be added to a project using cocoapods one may also use targets included in the project framework download a release of blockskit drag or add files blockskit xcodeproj to your xcode project using the navigator from the general pane of your application or framework add blockskit framework to the embedded binaries list import blockskit static library download a release of blockskit run archive in xcode by default the static library will be compiled to library developer xcode deriveddata move libblockskit a and headers to your projects folder preferably a subfolder like vendor in build phases drag libblockskit a into your targets link binary with libraries build phase in the build settings of your target or project change other linker flags to objc make sure your app is linked with coregraphics foundation messageui and uikit change or add to header search paths the relative path to blockskits headers like srcroot vendor headers insert import blockskit blockskit h in your projects prefix header documentation an xcode compatible documentation set is available from cocoadocs license blockskit is maintained under the mit license the project itself is free for use in any and all projects you can use blockskit in any project public or private with or without attribution though we prefer attribution it helps us unsure about your rights read more individual credits for included code exist in the header files and documentation we thank them for their contributions to the open source community documentation help has been contributed by alex gray
