kops kubernetes operations godoc widget the easiest way to get a production grade kubernetes cluster up and running what is kops we like to think of it as kubectl for clusters kops helps you create destroy upgrade and maintain production grade highly available kubernetes clusters from the command line aws amazon web services is currently officially supported with gce in beta support and vmware vsphere in alpha and other platforms planned can i see it in action launching a kubernetes cluster hosted on aws gce or digitalocean to replicate the above demo check out our tutorial for launching a kubernetes cluster hosted on aws to install a kubernetes cluster on gce please follow this guide to install a kubernetes cluster on digitalocean follow this guide features automates the provisioning of kubernetes clusters in aws and gce deploys highly available ha kubernetes masters built on a state sync model for dry runs and automatic idempotency ability to generate terraform supports custom kubernetes add ons command line autocompletion yaml manifest based api configuration templating and dry run modes for creating manifests choose from eight different cni networking providers out of the box supports upgrading from kube up capability to add containers as hooks and files to nodes via a cluster manifest documentation documentation is in the docs directory and the index is here kubernetes release compatibility kubernetes version support kops is intended to be backward compatible it is always recommended to use the latest version of kops with whatever version of kubernetes you are using always use the latest version of kops one exception in regards to compatibility kops supports the equivalent kubernetes minor release number a minor version is the second digit in the release number kops version 1 8 0 has a minor version of 8 the numbering follows the semantic versioning specification major minor patch for example kops 1 8 0 does not support kubernetes 1 9 2 but kops 1 9 0 supports kubernetes 1 9 2 and previous kubernetes versions only when kops minor version matches the kubernetes minor version does kops officially support the kubernetes release kops does not stop a user from installing mismatching versions of k8s but kubernetes releases always require kops to install specific versions of components like docker that tested against the particular kubernetes version compatibility matrix kops version k8s 1 5 x k8s 1 6 x k8s 1 7 x k8s 1 8 x k8s 1 9 x 1 9 x y y y y y 1 8 x y y y y n 1 7 x y y y n n 1 6 x y y n n n use the latest version of kops for all releases of kubernetes with the caveat that higher versions of kubernetes are not officially supported by kops kops release schedule this project does not follow the kubernetes release schedule kops aims to provide a reliable installation experience for kubernetes and typically releases about a month after the corresponding kubernetes release this time allows for the kubernetes project to resolve any issues introduced by the new version and ensures that we can support the latest features kops will release alpha and beta pre releases for people that are eager to try the latest kubernetes release please only use pre ga kops releases in environments that can tolerate the quirks of new releases and please do report any issues encountered installing prerequisite kubectl is required see here osx from homebrew console brew update brew install kops the kops binary is also available via our releases linux console curl lo https github com kubernetes kops releases download
