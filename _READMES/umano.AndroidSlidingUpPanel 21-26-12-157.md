note we are not actively responding to issues right now if you find a bug please submit a pr android sliding up panel this library provides a simple way to add a draggable sliding up panel popularized by google music and google maps to your android application as seen in umano android app now acquired by dropbox known uses in popular apps soundcloud https play google com store apps details id com soundcloud android dropbox paper https play google com store apps details id com dropbox paper snaptee https play google com store apps details id co snaptee android if you are using the library and you would like to have your app listed simply let us know importing the library simply add the following dependency to your build gradle file to use the latest version groovy dependencies repositories mavencentral compile com sothree slidinguppanel library 3 4 0 usage include com sothree slidinguppanel slidinguppanellayout as the root element in your activity layout the layout must have gravity set to either top or bottom make sure that it has two children the first child is your main layout the second child is your layout for the sliding up panel the main layout should have the width and the height set to match parent the sliding layout should have the width set to match parent and the height set to either match parent wrap content or the max desireable height if you would like to define the height as the percetange of the screen set it to match parent and also define a layout weight attribute for the sliding view by default the whole panel will act as a drag region and will intercept clicks and drag events you can restrict the drag area to a specific view by using the setdragview method or umanodragview attribute for more information please refer to the sample code xml textview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent android gravity center android text main content android textsize 16sp textview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent android gravity center top android text the awesome sliding up panel android textsize 16sp for smooth interaction with the actionbar make sure that windowactionbaroverlay is set to true in your styles xml item name android windowactionbaroverlay true item however in this case you would likely want to add a top margin to your main layout of android attr actionbarsizeor attr actionbarsize to support older api versions caveats additional features and customization if you are using a custom umanodragview the panel will pass through the click events to the main layout make your second layout clickable to prevent this you can change the panel height by using the setpanelheight method or umanopanelheight attribute if you would like to hide the shadow above the sliding panel set shadowheight attribute to 0 use setenabled false to completely disable the sliding panel including touch and programmatic sliding use settouchenabled false to disables panels touch responsiveness drag and click you can still control the panel programatically use getpanelstate to get the current panel state use setpanelstate to set the current panel state you can add parallax to the main view by setting umanoparallaxoffset attribute see demo for the example you can set a anchor point in the middle of the screen using setanchorpoint to allow an intermediate expanded state for the panel similar to google maps you can set a panelslidelistener to monitor events about sliding panes you can also make the panel slide from the top by changing the layout gravity attribute of the layout to top you can provide a scroll interpolator for the panel movement by setting umanoscrollinterpolator attribute for instance if you want a bounce or overshoot effect for the panel by default the panel pushes up the main content you can make it overlay the main content by using setoverlayed method or umanooverlay attribute this is useful if you would like to make the sliding layout semi transparent you can also set umanoclippanel to false to make the panel transparent in non overlay mode by default the main content is dimmed as the panel slides up you can change the dim color by changing umanofadecolor set it to android color transparent to remove dimming completely scrollable sliding views if you have a scrollable view inside of the sliding panel make sure to set umanoscrollableview attribute on the panel to supported nested scrolling the panel supports listview scrollview and recyclerview out of the box but you can add support for any type of a scrollable view by setting a custom scrollableviewhelper here is an example for nestedscrollview public class nestedscrollableviewhelper extends scrollableviewhelper public int getscrollableviewscrollposition view scrollableview boolean isslidingup if mscrollableview instanceof nestedscrollview if isslidingup return mscrollableview getscrolly else nestedscrollview nsv nestedscrollview mscrollableview view child nsv getchildat 0 return child getbottom nsv getheight nsv getscrolly else return 0 once you define your helper you can set it using setscrollableviewhelper on the sliding panel implementation this library was initially based on the opened sourced slidingpanelayout component from the r13 of the android support library thanks android team requirements tested on android 2 2 other contributors
