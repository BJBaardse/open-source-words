gun is a realtime distributed offline first graph database engine doing 20m ops sec in just 9kb gzipped why realtime you might use socket io for realtime updates but what happens if you reload the page gun solves state synchronization for you no matter what on reloads across all your users and even on conflicting updates distributed gun is peer to peer by design meaning you have no centralized database server to maintain or that could crash this lets you sleep through the night without worrying about database devops we call it nodb from there you can build decentralized federated or centralized apps offline first gun works even if your internet or cell reception doesnt users can still plug away and save data as normal and then when the network comes back online gun will automatically synchronize all the changes and handle any conflicts for you graph most databases force you to bend over backwards to match their storage constraints but graphs are different they let you have any data structure you want whether that be traditional tables with relations document oriented trees or tons of circular references you choose quickstart try the interactive tutorial in the browser 5min average developer or npm install gun and run the examples with cd node modules gun npm start 5min average developer note if you dont have node or npm read this first if the npm command line didnt work you may need to mkdir node modules first or use sudo an online demo of the examples are available here http gunjs herokuapp com or write a quick app try now in jsbin html var gun require gun in nodejs var gun require gun gun in react var gun gun li ul p gun get mark put name mark email mark gundb io p p gun get mark on function data key console log update data or try something mind blowing like saving circular references to a table of documents play http jsbin com wefozepume edit js console javascript var cat name fluffy species kitty var mark boss cat cat slave mark partial updates merge with existing data gun get mark put mark access the data as if it is a document gun get mark get boss get name val function data key val grabs the data once no subscriptions console log marks boss is data traverse a graph of circular references gun get mark get boss get slave once function data key console log mark is the slave data add both of them to a table gun get list set gun get mark get boss gun get list set gun get mark grab each item once from the table continuously gun get list map once function data key console log item data live update the table gun get list set type cucumber goal scare cat support thanks to lorenzo mangani sam liu daniel dombrowsky vincent woo aj oneal bill ottman sean matheson alan mimms dário freire john williamson join others in sponsoring code https www patreon com gundb ask questions http stackoverflow com questions tagged gun found a bug report at https github com amark gun issues need help chat with us https gitter im amark gun documentation api reference tutorials examples graphql electron react native vue react webcomponents cap theorem tradeoffs how data sync works how gun is built crypto auth modules roadmap this would not be possible without community contributors big shout out to anywhichway block storage beebase quasar brockatkinson brunch config brysgo graphql d3x0r sqlite forrestjt file js hillct docker josepedrodias graph visualizer juniperchicago cycle js bindings jveres todomvc kristianmandrup edge lmangani cytoscape visualizer cassandra fastify letsencrypt mhelander sea omarzion sticky note app psychollama leveldb rangermauve schema robertheessels gun p2p auth sbeleidy sean matheson observable rxjs most js bindings stefdv polymer web components sjones6 flint zrrrzzt jwt auth 88dev database viewer i am missing many others apologies will be adding them soon deploy to quickly spin up a gun test server for your development team utilize either heroku or docker or any variant thereof dokku flynn io now sh etc heroku or bash git clone https github com amark gun git cd gun heroku create git push f heroku head master then visit the url in the output of the heroku create step in a browser now sh bash npm install g now now npm amark gun then visit the url in the output of the now npm step in your browser docker pull from the docker hub or bash docker run p 8080 8080 gundb gun or build the docker image locally bash git clone https github com amark gun git cd gun docker build t myrepo gundb v1 docker run p 8080 8080 myrepo gundb v1 or if you prefer your docker image with metadata labels linux mac only bash npm run docker docker run p 8080 8080 username gun git then visit http localhost 8080 in your browser license designed with ♥ by mark nadal the gun team and many amazing contributors openly licensed under zlib mit apache 2 0 youtube twitter
