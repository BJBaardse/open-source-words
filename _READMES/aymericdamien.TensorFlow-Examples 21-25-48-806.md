tensorflow examples this tutorial was designed for easily diving into tensorflow through examples for readability it includes both notebooks and source codes with explanation it is suitable for beginners who want to find clear and concise examples about tensorflow besides the traditional raw tensorflow implementations you can also find the latest tensorflow api practices such as layers estimator dataset update 03 18 2018 tensorflows eager api examples available tf v1 5 recommended if you are using older tensorflow version 0 11 and under please have a look here tutorial index 0 prerequisite introduction to machine learning introduction to mnist dataset 1 introduction hello world notebook code very simple example to learn how to print hello world using tensorflow basic operations notebook code a simple example that cover tensorflow basic operations tensorflow eager api basics notebook code get started with tensorflows eager api 2 basic models linear regression notebook code implement a linear regression with tensorflow linear regression eager api notebook code implement a linear regression using tensorflows eager api logistic regression notebook code implement a logistic regression with tensorflow logistic regression eager api notebook code implement a logistic regression using tensorflows eager api nearest neighbor notebook code implement nearest neighbor algorithm with tensorflow k means notebook code build a k means classifier with tensorflow random forest notebook code build a random forest classifier with tensorflow 3 neural networks

recurrent neural network lstm notebook code build a bi directional recurrent neural network lstm to classify mnist digits dataset dynamic recurrent neural network lstm notebook code build a recurrent neural network lstm that performs dynamic calculation to classify sequences of different length unsupervised auto encoder notebook code build an auto encoder to encode an image to a lower dimension and re construct it variational auto encoder notebook code build a variational auto encoder vae to encode and generate images from noise gan generative adversarial networks notebook code build a generative adversarial network gan to generate images from noise dcgan deep convolutional generative adversarial networks notebook code build a deep convolutional generative adversarial network dcgan to generate images from noise 4 utilities save and restore a model notebook code save and restore a model with tensorflow tensorboard graph and loss visualization notebook code use tensorboard to visualize the computation graph and plot the loss tensorboard advanced visualization notebook code going deeper into tensorboard visualize the variables gradients and more 5 data management build an image dataset notebook code build your own images dataset with tensorflow data queues from image folders or a dataset file tensorflow dataset api notebook code introducing tensorflow dataset api for optimizing the input data pipeline 6 multi gpu basic operations on multi gpu notebook code a simple example to introduce multi gpu in tensorflow train a neural network on multi gpu notebook code a clear and simple tensorflow implementation to train a convolutional neural network on multiple gpus dataset some examples require mnist dataset for training and testing dont worry this dataset will automatically be downloaded when running examples mnist is a database of handwritten digits for a quick description of that dataset you can check this notebook official website http yann lecun com exdb mnist installation to download all the examples simply clone this repository git clone https github com aymericdamien tensorflow examples to run them you also need the latest version of tensorflow to install it pip install tensorflow or if you want gpu support pip install tensorflow gpu for more details about tensorflow installation you can check tensorflow installation guide more examples the following examples are coming from tflearn a library that provides a simplified interface for tensorflow you can have a look there are many examples and pre built operations and layers tutorials tflearn quickstart learn the basics of tflearn through a concrete machine learning task build and train a deep neural network classifier examples tflearn examples a large collection of examples using tflearn
