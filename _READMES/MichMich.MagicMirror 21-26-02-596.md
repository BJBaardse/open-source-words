magicmirror² is an open source modular smart mirror platform with a growing list of installable modules the magicmirror² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant magicmirror² is built by the creator of the original magicmirror with the incredible help of a growing community of contributors magicmirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses electron as an application wrapper so no more web server or browser installs necessary table of contents installation raspberry pi general server only client only docker configuration modules updating known issues community contributing guidelines manifesto installation raspberry pi automatic installation raspberry pi only electron the app wrapper around magicmirror² only supports the raspberry pi 2 3 the raspberry pi 0 1 is currently not supported if you want to run this on a raspberry pi 1 use the server only feature and setup a fullscreen browser yourself yes people have managed to run mm² also on a pi0 so if you insist search in the forums note that you will need to install the lastest full version of raspbian dont use the lite version execute the following command on your raspberry pi to install magicmirror² bash bash c curl sl https raw githubusercontent com michmich magicmirror master installers raspberry sh manual installation download and install the latest node js version clone the repository and check out the master branch git clone https github com michmich magicmirror enter the repository cd magicmirror install and run the app with npm install npm start \ for server only use npm install node serveronly warning important the installation step for npm install will take a very long time often with little or no terminal response \ for the rpi3 this is 10 minutes and for the rpi2 25 minutes \ do not interrupt or you risk getting a broken heart by raspberry jam also note that npm start does not work via ssh but you can use display 0 nohup npm start instead \ this starts the mirror on the remote display if you want to debug on raspberry pi you can use npm start dev which will start mm with dev tools enabled to access toolbar menu when in mirror mode hit alt key to toggle the web developer tools from mirror mode use ctrl shift i or alt and select view server only in some cases you want to start the application without an actual app window in this case you can start magicmirror² in server only mode by manually running node serveronly or using docker this will start the server after which you can open the application in your browser of choice detailed description below important make sure that you whitelist the interface ip ipwhitelist in the server config where you want the client to connect to otherwise it will not be allowed to connect to the server you also need to set the local host address field to 0 0 0 0 in order for the rpi to listen on all interfaces and not only localhost default javascript var config address 0 0 0 0 default is localhost port 8080 default ipwhitelist 127 0 0 1 ffff 127 0 0 1 1 ffff 172 17 0 1 default need to add your ip here client only this is when you already have a server running remotely and want your rpi to connect as a standalone client to this instance to show the mm from the server then from your rpi you run it with node clientonly address 192 168 1 5 port 8080 specify the ip address and port number of the server docker magicmirror² in server only mode can be deployed using docker after a successful docker installation you just need to execute the following command in the shell bash docker run d \ publish 80 8080 \ restart always \ volume magic mirror config opt magic mirror config \ volume magic mirror modules opt magic mirror modules \ name magic mirror \ bastilimbach docker magicmirror to get more information about the available dockerfile versions and configurations head over to the respective github repository configuration raspberry specific the following wiki links are helpful for the initial configuration of your magicmirror² operating system configuring the raspberry pi auto starting magicmirror general copy home pi magicmirror config config js sample to home pi magicmirror config config js \ note if you used the installer script this step is already done for you modify your required settings \ note youll can check your configuration running npm run config check in home pi magicmirror the following properties can be configured option description port the port on which the magicmirror² server will run on the default value is 8080 address the interface ip address on which to accept connections the default is localhost which would prevent exposing the built in webserver to machines on the local network to expose it to other machines use 0 0 0 0 ipwhitelist the list of ips from which you are allowed to access the magicmirror² the default value is 127 0 0 1 ffff 127 0 0 1 1 which is from localhost only add your ip when needed you can also specify ip ranges with subnet masks 127 0 0 1 127 0 0 1 24 or directly with 127 0 0 1 192 168 0 1 192 168 0 100 set to allow all ip addresses for more information see follow post ipwhitelist howto zoom this allows to scale the mirror contents with a given zoom factor the default value is 1 0 language the language of the interface note not all elements will be localized possible values are en nl ru fr etc but the default value is en timeformat the form of time notation that will be used possible values are 12 or 24 the default is 24 units the units that will be used in the default weather modules possible values are metric or imperial the default is metric modules an array of active modules the array must contain objects see the next table below for more information electronoptions an optional array of electron browser options this allows configuration of e g the browser screen size and position example electronoptions fullscreen false width 800 height 600 kiosk mode can be enabled by setting kiosk true autohidemenubar false and fullscreen false more options can be found here customcss the path of the custom css stylesheet the default is css custom css module configuration option description module the name of the module this can also contain the subfolder valid examples include clock default calendar and custommodules mymodule position the location of the module in which the module will be loaded possible values are top bar top left top center top right upper third middle center lower third bottom left bottom center bottom right bottom bar fullscreen above and fullscreen below this field is optional but most modules require this field to set check the documentation of the module for more information multiple modules with the same position will be ordered based on the order in the configuration file classes additional classes which are passed to the module the field is optional header to display a header text above the module add the header property this field is optional disabled set disabled to true to skip creating the module this field is optional config an object with the module configuration properties check the documentation of the module for more information this field is optional unless the module requires extra configuration modules the following modules are installed by default clock calendar current weather weather forecast news feed compliments hello world alert for more available modules check out out the wiki page magicmirror² 3rd party modules if you want to build your own modules check out the magicmirror² module development documentation and dont forget to add it to the wiki and the forum updating if you want to update your magicmirror² to the latest version use your terminal to go to your magic mirror folder and type the following command bash git pull npm install if you changed nothing more than the config or the modules this should work without any problems type git status to see your changes if there are any you can reset them with git reset hard after that git pull should be possible community the community around the magicmirror² is constantly growing we even have a forum now where you can share your ideas ask questions help others and get inspired by other builders we would love to see you there contributing guidelines contributions of all kinds are welcome not only in the form of code but also with regards bug reports and documentation please keep the following in mind bug reports make sure youre running the latest version if the issue s still persist please open a clearly documented issue with a clear title minor bug fixes please send a pull request with a clear explanation of the issue or a link to the issue it solves major bug fixes please discuss your approach in an github issue before you start to alter a big part of the code new features please please discuss in a github issue before you start to alter a big part of the code without discussion upfront the pull request will not be accepted merged thanks for your help in making magicmirror² better manifesto a real manifesto is still to be written till then michaels response on one of the repository issues gives a great summary i started this project as an ultimate starter project for raspberry pi enthusiasts as a matter of fact for most of the contributors the magicmirror project is the first open source project they ever contributed to this is one of the reasons why the magicmirror project is featured in several raspi magazines the project has a lot of opportunities for improvement we could use a powerful framework like vue to ramp up the development speed we could use sass for better easier css implementations we could make it an npm installable package and as you say we could bundle it up the big downside of of of these changes is that it over complicates things a user no longer will be able to open just one file and make a small modification and see how it works out of course a bundled version can be complimentary to the regular un bundled version and im sure a lot of new users will opt for the bundled version but this means those users wont be motivated to take a peek under the hood they will just remain users they wont become contributors and worse they wont be motivated to take their first steps in software development and to be honest motivating curious users to step out of their comfort zone and take those first steps is what drives me in this project therefor my ultimate goal is this project is to keep it as accessible as possible michael teeuw
