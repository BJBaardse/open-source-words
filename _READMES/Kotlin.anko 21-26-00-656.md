anko is a kotlin library which makes android application development faster and easier it makes your code clean and easy to read and lets you forget about rough edges of the android sdk for java anko consists of several parts anko commons a lightweight library full of helpers for intents dialogs logging and so on anko layouts a fast and type safe way to write dynamic android layouts anko sqlite a query dsl and parser collection for android sqlite anko coroutines utilities based on the kotlinx coroutines library anko commons anko commons is a toolbox for kotlin android developer the library contains a lot of helpers for android sdk including but not limited to intents wiki dialogs and toasts wiki logging wiki resources and dimensions wiki anko layouts wiki anko layouts is a dsl for writing dynamic android layouts here is a simple ui written with anko dsl kotlin verticallayout val name edittext button say hello onclick toast hello name text the code above creates a button inside a linearlayout and attaches an onclicklistener to that button moreover onclick accepts a suspend lambda so you can write your asynchronous code right inside the listener note that this is the complete layout code no xml is required anko has a dsl for constraintlayout since v0 10 4 there is also a plugin for android studio that supports previewing anko dsl layouts anko sqlite wiki have you ever been tired of parsing sqlite query results using android cursors anko sqlite provides lots of helpers to simplify working with sqlite databases for example here is how you can fetch the list of users with a particular name kotlin fun getusers db managedsqliteopenhelper list user db use db select users wheresimple family name john doexec parselist userparser anko coroutines wiki anko coroutines is based on the kotlinx coroutines library and provides bg function that executes your code in a common pool asreference function which creates a weak reference wrapper by default a coroutine holds references to captured objects until it is finished or canceled if your asynchronous framework does not support cancellation the values you use inside the asynchonous block can be leaked asreference protects you from this using anko gradle based project anko has a meta dependency which plugs in all available features including commons layouts sqlite into your project at once gradle dependencies implementation org jetbrains anko anko anko version make sure that you have the anko version settled in your gradle file at the project level ext anko version 0 10 6 if you only need some of the features you can reference any of ankos parts gradle dependencies anko commons implementation org jetbrains anko anko commons anko version anko layouts implementation org jetbrains anko anko sdk25 anko version sdk15 sdk19 sdk21 sdk23 are also available implementation org jetbrains anko anko appcompat v7 anko version coroutine listeners for anko layouts implementation org jetbrains anko anko sdk25 coroutines anko version implementation org jetbrains anko anko appcompat v7 coroutines anko version anko sqlite implementation org jetbrains anko anko sqlite anko version there are also a number of artifacts for the android support libraries gradle dependencies appcompat v7 only anko commons implementation org jetbrains anko anko appcompat v7 commons anko version appcompat v7 anko layouts implementation org jetbrains anko anko appcompat v7 anko version implementation org jetbrains anko anko coroutines anko version cardview v7 implementation org jetbrains anko anko cardview v7 anko version design implementation org jetbrains anko anko design anko version implementation org jetbrains anko anko design coroutines anko version gridlayout v7 implementation org jetbrains anko anko gridlayout v7 anko version percent implementation org jetbrains anko anko percent anko version recyclerview v7 implementation org jetbrains anko anko recyclerview v7 anko version implementation org jetbrains anko anko recyclerview v7 coroutines anko version support v4 only anko commons implementation org jetbrains anko anko support v4 commons anko version support v4 anko layouts implementation org jetbrains anko anko support v4 anko version constraintlayout implementation org jetbrains anko anko constraint layout anko version there is an example project showing how to include anko library into your android gradle project intellij idea project if your project is not based on gradle just attach the required jars from the jcenter repository as the library dependencies and thats it contributing the best way to submit a patch is to send us a pull request before submitting the pull request make sure all existing tests are passing and add the new test if it is required if you want to add new functionality please file a new proposal issue first to make sure that it is not in progress already if you have any questions feel free to create a question issue instructions for building anko are available in the wiki
