interest in contributing there are many ways to contribute to this project get started here tests use unittest for running all tests write down python3 m unittest discover tests for running some specific tests you can do this as following ex sort python3 m unittest tests test sort use pytest for running all tests write down python3 m pytest tests install if you want to use the api algorithms in your code it is as simple as pip3 install algorithms you can test by creating a python file ex use merge sort in sort python3 from algorithms sort import merge sort if name main my list 1 8 3 5 6 my list merge sort my list print my list uninstall if you want to uninstall algorithms it is as simple as pip3 uninstall y algorithms list of implementations arrays delete nth flatten garage josephus
