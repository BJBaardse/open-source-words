js sequence diagrams generates uml sequence diagrams from simple text https bramp github io js sequence diagrams by andrew brampton 2012 2017 example we turn alice bob hello bob how are you note right of bob bob thinks bob alice i am good thanks into requirements you will need snap svg web font loader if you wish to use custom fonts underscore js or lodash and optionally jquery installation bower run bower install bramp js sequence diagrams and include the scripts below html script src bower directory bower webfontloader webfont js script src bower directory snap svg dist snap svg min js script src bower directory underscore underscore min js script src bower directory js sequence diagrams dist sequence diagram min js also import the css if you plan to use the hand drawn theme html link href bower directory js sequence diagrams dist sequence diagram min css rel stylesheet not using bower no problem just download the dependencies and include them yourself if you plan to use the hand draw theme dont forget to put the two fontfiles in your css folder fonts daniel danielbd woff and fonts daniel danielbd woff2 usage you can use the diagram class like html div id diagram diagram will be placed here div script var d diagram parse a b does something var options theme simple d drawsvg diagram options script or use jquery to do all the work html script src bower directory jquery dist jquery min js div class diagram a b message div script var options theme hand diagram sequencediagram options script for full examples check out the demo site options javascript var options change the styling of the diagram typically one of simple hand new themes can be registered with registertheme theme string css style to apply to the diagrams svg tag only supported if using snap svg css class string styling the following css classes are applied to the svg diagram when using snap svg sequence applies to main svg tag title applied to the title of the diagram actor applied to the actors signal applied to the signals note applied to all notes the diagram can then be customised for example css signal text fill 000000 signal text hover fill aaaaaa note rect note path fill ffff00 title rect title path actor rect actor path fill ffffff raphaël deprecation version 1 x of this library used raphaël for drawing the diagrams however raphaël had some limitations and since disappeared from the internet weve decided to move to snap svg which is a pure svg implementation instead of raphaël which in addition to svg also supported vml on internet explorer this support of vml made it impossible to use some newer svg capabilities native svg allows us to use css styling better font support animations and more to aid in the transition version 2 x will support both raphaël and snap svg preferring snap svg if you include raphaël instead of snap svg it will default to using raphaël as the rendering library for example html script src bower directory raphael raphael min js script there are also four transitional themes snapsimple snaphand raphaelsimple raphaelhand which force the use of either snap svg or raphaël the plan is to drop support for raphaël in a future release simplifying the library and reducing the file size adding a font raphael requires cufon style fonts find the font you want in ttf or otf format visit cufons site and process it into a javascript file then ensure the font is included via the html or recompile after altering main js so far only the hand drawn font daniel bold has been included build requirements the build is managed by a makefile and uses various tools available from npm thus both make and npm are required and can easily be installed on any linux or mac machine bash make the makefile will use npm to install all the dev dependencies build and test testing we use qunit for testing it can be ran from the command line or via a browser the command line actually tests multiple permutations of lodash underscore and with and without minification bash make test global summary ┌───────┬───────┬────────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────┐ │ files │ tests │ assertions │ failed │ passed │ runtime │

generated svg is correct improve the hand drawn theme note left of bob generates a small empty box the font seems to have extra margin at the bottom the wiggly lines dont always touch dozens of other
