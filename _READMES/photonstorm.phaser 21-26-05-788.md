phaser grab the source and join the fun 13th june 2018 im pleased to announce that phaser 3 10 0 is now available this release represents just under a months worth of work and is a huge version for us it introduces a lot of significant new features into v3 including multi touch support custom cursors pixel perfect detection scene isolated input events new input plugins a brand new gamepad system and plenty more there are big changes in arcade physics too with a new fixed timestep option angular damping speed improvements support for time scaling across your whole physics simulation and yes even more the data manager too has been given a real shot in the arm and there are subtle but important changes to the scene flow and loader interactions there are of course plenty of bug fixes and updates too id urge you to carefully read the change log especially if upgrading from an earlier version in an existing project hundreds more areas have been covered with documentation too an on going battle which were winning albeit slowly 3 10 is a huge release and represents tireless effort on my part to get it into this shape my aim has always been to continue the mission of enhancing phaser 3 as quickly as i can it means releasing significant updates in relatively short periods of time but it also means im jumping on bug reports as quickly as i can keeping the issues list total nice and low the vast majority of the items in there are feature requests now a massive thank you to all of you who support phaser on patreon and paypal its your support that allows me to work on this full time to the benefit of everyone as always please check out the change log for comprehensive details about what recent versions contain about phaser 3 after 1 5 years in the making tens of thousands of lines of code hundreds of examples and countless hours of relentless work phaser 3 is finally out it has been a real labor of love and then some please understand this is a bleeding edge and brand new release there are features weve had to leave out areas of the documentation that need completing and so many cool new things we wanted to add but we had to draw a line in the sand somewhere and 3 0 0 represents that for us this is just the start of a new chapter in phasers life we will be jumping on bug reports as quickly as we can and releasing new versions rapidly weve structured v3 in such a way that we can push out point releases as fast as needed we publish our developer logs in the phaser world newsletter subscribe to stay in touch and get all the latest news from us and the wider phaser community you can also follow phaser on twitter and chat with fellow phaser devs in our slack and discord channels phaser 3 wouldnt have been possible without the fantastic support of the community and patreon thank you to everyone who supports our work who shares our belief in the future of html5 gaming and phasers role in that happy coding everyone cheers rich photonstorm developing

locally you can checkout the phaser3 docs repository and then read the documentation by pointing your browser to the local docs folder and again selecting from the classes or namespaces links at the top of the page the documentation for phaser 3 is an on going project please help us by searching the phaser code for any instance of the string description and then replacing it with some documentation typescript definitions typescript definitions are now available they are automatically generated from the jsdoc comments in the phaser source code if you wish to help refine them then you must edit the phaser jsdoc blocks directly you can find more details including the source to the conversion tool we wrote in the docs repo as soon as were happy with the accuracy of the ts defs well merge them into the main repo for now please download them from the docs repo linked above and add them to your project when we release new versions of phaser we publish new ts defs too webpack we use webpack to build phaser and we take advantage of its conditional build flag feature to handle renderer swapping if you wish to use webpack with phaser then please use our phaser 3 project template as its already set up to handle the build conditions phaser needs recent changes to our build steps mean you should now be able to us any other packager like parcel without any config changes license phaser is released under the mit license phaser 3 is so new the paint is still wet but tutorials and guides are starting to come out getting started with phaser 3 useful if you are completely new to phaser making your first phaser 3 game phaser 3 bootstrap and platformer example also please subscribe to the phaser world newsletter for details about new tutorials as they are published source code examples during our development of phaser 3 we created hundreds of examples with the full source code and assets until these examples are fully integrated into the phaser website you can browse them on phaser 3 labs or clone the examples repo we are constantly adding to and refining these examples create your first phaser 3 example create an index html page locally and paste the following code into it html doctype html script script this is a standard empty webpage youll notice theres a script tag that is pulling in a build of phaser 3 but otherwise this webpage doesnt do anything yet now lets set up the game config paste the following between the script script tags javascript var config type phaser auto width 800 height 600 physics default arcade arcade gravity y 200 scene preload preload create create config is a pretty standard phaser 3 game configuration object we tell config to use the webgl renderer if it can set the canvas to a size of 800x600 pixels enable arcade physics and finally call the preload and create functions preload and create have not been implemented yet so if you run this javascript code you will have an error add the following after config javascript var game new phaser game config function preload this load setbaseurl http labs phaser io this load image sky assets skies space3 png this load image logo assets sprites phaser3 logo png this load image red assets particles red png function create game is a phaser game instance that uses our configuration object config we also add function definitions for preload and create the preload function helps you easily load assets into your game in preload we set the base url to be the phaser server and load 3 png files the create function is empty so its time to fill it in javascript function create this add image 400 300 sky var particles this add particles red var emitter particles createemitter speed 100 scale start 1 end 0 blendmode add var logo this physics add image 400 100 logo logo setvelocity 100 200 logo setbounce 1 1 logo setcollideworldbounds true emitter startfollow logo here we add a sky image into the game and create a particle emitter the scale value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses after creating the emitter we add a logo image called logo since logo is a physics image logo is given a physics body by default we set some properties for logo velocity bounce or restitution and collision with the world bounds these properties will make our logo bounce around the screen finally we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo so as the logo moves the particles will flow from it run it in your browser and youll see the following got an error heres the full code this is a tiny example and there are hundreds more for you to explore but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick phaser is to use with just a few easily readable lines of code weve got something pretty impressive up on screen subscribe to our newsletter for further tutorials and examples there are both plain and minified compiled versions of phaser in the dist folder of the repository the plain version is for use during development and the minified version is for production use you can also create your own builds custom builds phaser 3 is built using webpack and we take advantage of the webpack defineplugin feature to allow for conditional building of the canvas and webgl renderers as of phaser 3 7 we have updated our webpack config to make our source far easier to consume in other package managers like parcel and electron please look our webpack config files to get an idea of the settings we use building from source if you wish to build phaser 3 from source ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running npm install you can then run webpack to create a development build in the build folder which includes source maps for local testing you can also npm run dist to create a minified packaged build in the dist folder for a list of all commands available use npm run help change log version 3 10 1 hayashi 13th june 2018 bug fixes the inputmanager would only create 1 pointer even if touch input was enabled in the config which meant you couldnt use touch events unless you first called addpointer or specified one in the config now it touch is enabled in the config itll always create 2 pointers by default version 3 10 0 hayashi 13th june 2018 input system new features updates all input classes are now covered 100 by jsdocs the input manager and input plugin have been updated to support multiple simultaneous pointers before only one active pointer mouse or touch was supported now you can have as many active pointers as you need allowing for complex multi touch games these are stored in the input manager pointers array addpointer allows you to add one or more new pointers to the input manager there is no hard coded limit to the amount you can have although realistically you should never need more than 10 this method is available on both the input manager and plugin allowing you to use this input addpointer from within your game code inputmanager pointerstotal contains the total number of active pointers which can be set in the game config using the input activepointers property phaser will create 2 pointers on start unless a different value is given in the config or you can add them at run time mousepointer is a new property that is specifically allocated for mouse use only this is perfect for desktop only games but should be ignored if youre creating a mouse touch game use activepointer instead activepointer will now reflect the most recently active pointer on the game which is considered as being the pointer to have interacted with the game canvas most recently the inputmanager and inputplugin have three new methods addupcallback adddowncallback and addmovecallback these methods allow you to add callbacks to be invoked whenever native dom mouse or touch events are received callbacks passed to this method are invoked immediately when the dom event happens within the scope of the dom event handler therefore they are considered as native from the perspective of the browser this means they can be used for tasks such as opening new browser windows or anything which explicitly requires user input to activate however as a result of this they come with their own risks and as such should not be used for general game input but instead be reserved for special circumstances the callbacks can be set as isonce so you can control if the callback is called once then removed or every time the dom event occurs pointer has two new properties worldx and worldy which contain the position of the pointer translated into the coordinate space of the most recent camera it interacted with when checking to see if a pointer has interacted with any objects it will now iterate through the camera list previously it would only check against the top most camera in the list but now if the top most camera doesnt return anything it will move to the next camera and so on this also addresses 3631 thanks samid737 inputmanager dirty is a new internal property that reflects if any of the pointers have updated this frame inputmanager update now uses constants internally for the event type checking rather than string based like before inputmanager startpointer is a new internal method called automatically by the update loop that handles touch start events inputmanager updatepointer is a new internal method called automatically by the update loop that handles touch move events inputmanager stoppointer is a new internal method called automatically by the update loop that handles touch end events inputmanager hittest has had its arguments changed it no longer takes x y properties as the first two arguments but instead takes a pointer object from which the x y coordinates are extracted touchmanager handler has been removed as its no longer used internally touchmanager ontouchstart ontouchmove and ontouchend are the new dom touch event handlers they pass the events on to the inputmanagers queuetouchstart queuetouchmove and queuetouchend methods respectively mousemanager handler has been removed as its no longer used internally mousemanager onmousedown onmousemove and onmouseup are the new dom mouse event handlers they pass the events on to the inputmanagers queuemousedown queuemousemove and queuemouseup methods respectively setting enabled to false on either the touchmanager mousemanager or keyboardmanager will prevent it from handling any native dom events until you set it back again inputplugin has the following new read only properties mousepointer pointer1 pointer2 pointer3 pointer4 pointer5 pointer6 pointer7 pointer8 pointer9 and pointer10 most of these will be undefined unless you call addpointer first or set the active pointers quantity in your game config inputmanager has a new method transformpointer which will set the transformed x and y properties of a pointer in one call rather than the 2 calls it took before this is now used by all pointer event handlers inputplugin has a new method makepixelperfect which allows you to specify a texture based game object as being pixel perfect when performing all input checks against it you use it like this this add sprite x y key setinteractive this input makepixelperfect or the easier setinteractive pixelperfect true you can also pass or set an optional alpha tolerance level see the method docs for full details and the new examples to see it in action note that as a pointer interacts with the game object it will constantly poll the texture extracting a single pixel from the given coordinates and checking its color values this is an expensive process so should only be enabled on game objects that really need it input custom cursors you can now set a custom cursor for your game via this input setdefaultcursor this will take any valid css cursor string including urls to cursor image files you can now set a custom cursor for specific game objects this will take any valid css cursor string including urls to cursor image files and is used when ever a pointer is over that game object for example to have a hand cursor appear when over a button sprite you can do button input cursor pointer or to have a help cursor appear button input cursor help or to have a custom image button input cursor url assets cursors sword cur pointer you can also set a custom cursor in the new input configuration object to use the pointer hand cursor there is a new short cut setinteractive usehandcursor true to use anything else setinteractive cursor cssstring where cssstring is any valid css for setting a cursor please be aware of limitations when it comes to image based cursors between browsers its up to you to find a suitable format and size that fits the browsers you wish to support note virtually all modern browsers no longer support animated css cursors input configuration objects the setinteractive method can now take an input configuration object as its only argument this allows you to set multiple input related properties in a single call i e setinteractive draggable true pixelperfect true the available properties are hitarea the object shape to use as the hit area if not given it will try to create a rectangle based on the texture frame hitareacallback the callback that determines if the pointer is within the hit area shape or not draggable if true the interactive object will be set to be draggable and emit drag events dropzone if true the interactive object will be set to be a drop zone for draggable objects usehandcursor if true the interactive object will set the pointer hand cursor when a pointer is over it this is a short cut for setting cursor pointer cursor the css string to be used when the cursor is over this interactive object pixelperfect if true the pixel perfect function will be set for the hit area callback only works with texture based game objects alphatolerance if pixelperfect is set this is the alpha tolerance threshold value used in the callback input keyboard manager updates the keyboardmanager class has been removed it has been replaced with keyboardplugin which is now an input level plugin that registers itself with the new inputplugincache the input plugin class which belongs to a scene will now automatically inject registered plugins into itself on boot every scene has its own instance of the input plugin if enabled in the scene plugins which in turn has its own instance of the keyboardplugin the inputmanager no longer has any reference to the keyboard class at all the benefits of this are two fold first it allows you to now entirely exclude all of the keyboard classes from a custom build saving a lot of space if not required secondly it means that the scenes themselves are now responsible for keyboard events where as before they were entirely global this means a scene can be paused and stop processing keyboard events and stop having its key objects updated while another scene can still carry on doing this it also prevents key related callbacks in sleeping scenes from being fired which resolves issue 3733 thanks joemoov2 keyboardmanager handler has been renamed to onkeyhandler the keyboardmanager captures property has been removed as it can be more effectively handled by polling the keys object instead the keyboard manager will no longer process key down or up events if its enabled property is set to false or if the scene to which it belongs is not active the keyboard manager will now call event preventdefault on the native dom event as long as the key exists in the keys array and has its preventdefault property set to true which is the default this means you can now control specifically which key prevents default on the browser where as before every key added did so keyboardmanager addkeycapture and removekeycapture have been removed as you now control which keys prevent capture by using the addkey or addkeys methods see entry above the act of creating a key is now enough to enable capture of it and can be toggled at run time on a per key basis keyboardmanager addkeys can now take either an object or key codes or a comma separated string as its input this means you can now do keyboard addkeys w s a d and get an object back with the properties wsad mapped to the relevant key objects keyboardmanager addkey can now take either a key object a string such as a or space or a key code value keyboardmanager removekey can now take either a key object a string such as a or space or a key code value input gamepad manager updates the gamepadmanager class has been removed it has been replaced with gamepadplugin which is now an input level plugin that registers itself with the new inputplugincache the input plugin class which belongs to a scene will now automatically inject the registered plugins into itself on boot every scene has its own instance of the input plugin if enabled in the scene plugins which in turn has its own instance of the gamepadplugin the inputmanager no longer has any reference to the gamepad class at all the benefits of this are two fold first it allows you to now entirely exclude all of the gamepad classes from a custom build saving a lot of space if not required secondly it means that the scenes themselves are now responsible for gamepad events where as before they were entirely global this means a scene can be paused and stop processing gamepad events and stop having its gamepad objects updated while another scene can still carry on doing this it also prevents gamepad related callbacks in sleeping scenes from being fired the gamepad plugin has been rewritten from scratch it now offers a lot more features and far easier access to the gamepads and their properties you can now access the first 4 gamepads connected to the browser via the pad1 to pad4 properties meaning you can do this input gamepad pad1 for direct access to a pad once its connected the gamepad class has also been rewritten from scratch it will no longer create buttons or axes dynamically instead doing so on instantiation the gamepad class now has a bunch of new properties for easy access to the various standard mapping buttons these include left right up down for directions a y x and b for buttons l1 l2 r1 and r2 for shoulder buttons and leftstick and rightstick for the axis sticks you can still use gamepad getbuttonvalue to get the value from a button and gamepad getbuttontotal to get the total number of buttons available on the pad gamepad getaxistotal and gamepad getaxisvalue will return the total number of axis and an axis value accordingly gamepad setaxisthreshold will now let you set the threshold across all axis of a gamepad in one call the gamepad button objects will now emit 2 events one from the button itself and another from the gamepad this means you can listen for button events in 3 ways 1 by directly polling the button value in an update loop 2 listening for events on the gamepad plugin this input gamepad on down or 3 by listening for events on the gamepad itself gamepadreference on down arcade physics new features updates arcade physics now uses a fixed time step for all internal calculations there is a new fps config value and property defaults to 60fps which you can change at run time using the setfps method the core update loop has been recoded so that it steps based entirely on the given frame rate and not the wall clock or game step delta this fixed time step allows for a straightforward implementation of a deterministic game state meaning you can now set the fps rate to a high value such as 240 regardless of the browser update speed it will simply perform more physics steps per game step this is handy if you want to increase the accuracy of the simulation in certain cases you can also optionally call the step function directly to manually advance the simulation there is a new property timescale which will scale all time step calculations at run time allowing you to speed up or slow down your simulation at will without adjusting the frame rate you can now disable the use of the rtree for dynamic bodies via the config property usetree in certain situations i e densely packed worlds this may give better performance static bodies will always use an rtree collidespritevsgroup has been rewritten if you are using an rtree it now uses the results directly from the tree search instead of iterating all children in the group which dramatically reduces the work it does if you have disabled the rtree it performs a brute force o n2 sprite vs group iteration sweep we tested multiple axis sorting variants but the cost of the array allocation and or sorting with large amounts of bodies 10 000 far outweighed the simple math involved in the separation logic body usedamping is a new boolean property that allows you to use a damping effect for drag rather than the default linear deceleration this gives much better results if you need smooth deceleration across both axis such as the way the ship slows down in the game asteroids without the tell tale axis drift associated with linear drag getoverlapx and getoverlapy now use the calculated delta values not the deltax y methods collidespritevsgroup aborts early if the sprite body has been disabled updatemotion has a new argument delta which should typically be a fixed time delta value intersects has been restructured to prioritize rect vs rect checks body update and postupdate have been recoded to handle the new fixed time step system in place update now takes a new argument delta which is used internally for calculations body dirty has been removed as a property as its no longer used internally body deltaabsx and deltaabsy now return the cached absolute delta value from the previous update and no longer calculate it during the actual call world enable has been recoded to remove all the hasownproperty checks and streamline the internal flow world disable has been recoded to remove all the hasownproperty checks and streamline the internal flow world add is a new method that adds an existing body to the simulation and enablebody now passes its newly created bodies to this method world disablegameobjectbody has been removed as it duplicated what the disable method did there is a new internal flow with regard to the creation and disabling of bodies calling world enable will pass the objects to enablebody which will create a new body object if required and finally pass it to add world disable does the same but removes the bodies from the simulation it passes the bodies to disablebody which in turn passes it to remove both of these work for single objects an array of objects groups or even arrays of groups world computeangularvelocity is a new method that specifically calculates the angular velocity of a body world computevelocity has had its signature changed rather than taking a bunch of arguments all it now takes is a body and a delta value internally it now calculates both the x and y velocity components together in the same single call where as before it was split into two calls and multiple assignments world computevelocity no longer returns the new velocities they are now set directly on the body within the method world computevelocity has been recoded to use fuzzy greater than and less than calls when applying drag to a previously accelerated body using a fuzzy epsilon allows us to mitigate the ping pong issue where a decelerating body would constantly flip between a small negative and positive velocity value and never come to an actual rest world computevelocity now checks the body usedamping property to perform either linear deceleration or damping on the body world updatemotion has changed to call the new computeangularvelocity and computevelocity methods bodies set to bounce would eventually run out of velocity and stop this has been fixed as part of the refactoring of the time step and compute velocity updates fix 3593 thanks helmi77 if a body collides with a static body it will now set the blocked properties accordingly before it only set the touching properties this means you can now use checks like body onfloor when traversing static bodies thanks fariazz data manager new features and updates you can now access anything set in the datamanager using the new values property for example if you set a new value such as this data set gold 50 you can now access it via data values gold where it is treated as a normal property allowing you to use it in conditional evaluations if data values level 2 or modify it data values gold 50 each time a value is updated it emits a changedata event regardless if it is changed via the set method or the new values approach each time a value is updated it emits a new event named after the value for example if the value was called playerlives it will emit the event changedata playerlives this happens regardless if it is changed via the set method or the new values approach the set method can now take an object containing key value pairs as the first argument this means you can now set a bunch of values all at once i e data set name red gem stone level 2 owner link gold 50 the get method can now take an array of keys and will return an array of matching values this is handy for array destructuring in es6 the remove method can now take an array of keys and will remove all matching values emitting the removedata event for each the order of events has been updated when a value is first set and doesnt already exist in the data manager it will emit a setdata event if a value is set that already exists it instead emits a changedata and related changedata key event setting a new value no longer emits both events the resetfunction function has been removed from the changedata event arguments previously this was used to allow you to stop a value being updated by calling the reset function instead however it created brand new anonymous functions every single time a value was updated as you can now access stored data via the values property you can use this for much easier conditional checks and sets the blockset property has been removed as its no longer used internally loader and scene updates internally the loader has changed slightly rather than have each file cause the new batch to load an update method is polled every frame which does the same job instead this avoids load time race conditions where pre populated files would trigger loads part way during an existing load fixing 3705 in the process thanks the simian the scene manager has been updated so that it will call scene systems step during the init preload and create phase of your scene this means that any plugins or custom code written to use the scene systems preupdate update or postupdate events will need to be aware that these are now fired from init onwards not just once create has finished as a result of these two changes there is a new systems property called sceneupdate which is a reference that maps to your scene update function during init preload and create this is always mapped to noop once create has finished it gets re mapped to your scenes update function if your scene doesnt have one it remains mapped to noop in practise this means nothing has changed from before scene update never ran until create was completed and it still doesnt however because the internal scene systems are now updating right from init it means that things like the update list and physics systems are fully operational during your preloader this allows you to create far more elaborate preloaders than ever before although with great power comes great responsibility as the onus is now on you to be careful which events you consume especially input events during your preloader another side effect of these changes is that scenes no longer need an update function at all previously if they were missing one the scene manager would inject one into them automatically it no longer does this new features rendertexture resize will allow you to resize the underlying render texture to the new dimensions given doing this also clears the render texture at the same time thanks saqsun rectangle randomoutside is a new function that takes two rectangles outer and inner and returns a random point that falls within the outer rectangle but is always outside of the inner rectangle the update list has a new read only property length making it consistent with the display list thanks samme the 2d camera class has two new read only properties centerx and centery which return the coordinates of the center of the viewport relative to the canvas thanks samme camera has a new property visible an invisible camera will skip rendering and input tests of everything it can see this allows you to create say a mini cam and then toggle it on and off without needing to re create it each time camera has a new method setvisible which toggles its visible property cameramanager fromjson will now set the visible property is defined in the config sceneplugin run is a new method that will run the given scene and not change the state of the current scene at all if the scene is asleep it will be woken if its paused it will be resumed if not running at all it will be started texturemanager getpixelalpha is a new method that will return the alpha value of a pixel from the given texture and frame it will return null if the coordinates were out of bounds otherwise a value between 0 and 255 game isover is a new read only boolean property that indicates if the mouse pointer is currently over the game canvas or not it is set by the visibilityhandler and is only reliable on desktop systems a new event game mouseout is dispatched if the mouse leaves the game canvas you can listen to it from this sys game events on mouseout from within a scene a new event game mouseover is dispatched if the mouse enters the game canvas having previously been outside of it you can listen to it from this sys game events on mouseover from within a scene you can now use physicseditor https www codeandweb com physicseditor to create complex matter js bodies load them as normal json and then just pass it to the matter sprite as a shape property this matter add sprite x y texture frame shape shapes banana where shapes banana is one of the exported physicseditor shapes in the json you loaded see the physics matterjs advanced shape creation js example for more details updates the forwarddiffuselightpipeline used by the lights system now sets a flag if the scene doesnt contain any lights all of the game objects now check this flag and dont even bother adding themselves to the batch if there are no lights in the scene as theyd never render anyway this also avoids the ghost image problem if you swap scenes to a new scene with the light manager enabled but no actual lights defined fix 3707 thanks samvieten cameramanager getcamerabelowpointer has been renamed to getcamerasbelowpointer and it now returns an array of all the cameras below the given pointer not just the top most one the array is sorted so that the top most camera is at the start of the array in timestep step the rawdelta and delta values are checked to make sure they are non negative which can happen in chrome when the delta is reset and out of sync with the value passed to request animation frame fix 3088 thanks antriel cameras controls fixed has been removed its was deprecated a few versions ago please use fixedkeycontrol instead cameras controls smoothed has been removed its was deprecated a few versions ago please use smoothedkeycontrol instead bug fixes the canvas rendertexture drawimage method incorrectly set the values of the frame causing them to appear wrongly scaled in the canvas renderer fix 3710 thanks saqsun fixed math matrix4 makerotationaxis thanks hexus fixed an incorrect usage of math abs in math quaternion calculatew thanks qxzkjp particle emitter managers can now be added to containers thanks tadejzupancic fixed a method signature issue with the animation components remove handler when animations are removed from the animationmanager this prevented removed animations from stopping correctly if you set phaser to use a pre existing canvas element it is no longer re added to the dom thanks nqnstudios the tweenmanager gettweensof method has been fixed to remove a potential endless loop should multiple targets be passed in to it thanks cyantree interactive objects inside of containers would still fire their input events even if the container or any ancestor was set to be invisible objects now check their ancestor tree during the input cull and now properly skip input events if not visible fix 3620 thanks nemostein fixed device os incorrectly reporting linux as os on android devices thanks alebles examples documentation and typescript thanks to the work of hexus we have now documented all of the math namespace and made good progress on the game objects i personally have also documented the entire input system which was 328 classes properties and methods to describe as well as lots of other areas please see the complete change log for previous releases looking for a v2 change check out the phaser ce change log the contributors guide contains full details on how to help with phaser development the main points are found a bug report it on github issues and include a code sample please state which version of phaser you are using this is vitally
