socket io features socket io enables real time bidirectional event based communication it consists in a node js server this repository a javascript client library for the browser or a node js client some implementations in other languages are also available java c swift dart its main features are reliability connections are established even in the presence of proxies and load balancers personal firewall and antivirus software for this purpose it relies on engine io which first establishes a long polling connection then tries to upgrade to better transports that are tested on the side like websocket please see the goals section for more information auto reconnection support unless instructed otherwise a disconnected client will try to reconnect forever until the server is available again please see the available reconnection options here disconnection detection a heartbeat mechanism is implemented at the engine io level allowing both the server and the client to know when the other one is not responding anymore that functionality is achieved with timers set on both the server and the client with timeout values the pinginterval and pingtimeout parameters shared during the connection handshake those timers require any subsequent client calls to be directed to the same server hence the sticky session requirement when using multiples nodes binary support any serializable data structures can be emitted including arraybuffer and blob in the browser arraybuffer and buffer in node js simple and convenient api sample code js io on connection function socket socket emit request emit an event to the socket io emit broadcast emit an event to all connected sockets socket on reply function listen to the event cross browser browser support is tested in saucelabs multiplexing support in order to create separation of concerns within your application for example per module or based on permissions socket io allows you to create several namespaces which will act as separate communication channels but will share the same underlying connection room support within each namespace you can define arbitrary channels called rooms that sockets can join and leave you can then broadcast to any given room reaching every socket that has joined it this is a useful feature to send notifications to a group of users or to a given user connected on several devices for example note socket io is not a websocket implementation although socket io indeed uses websocket as a transport when possible it adds some metadata to each packet the packet type the namespace and the ack id when a message acknowledgement is needed that is why a websocket client will not be able to successfully connect to a socket io server and a socket io client will not be able to connect to a websocket server like ws echo websocket org either please see the protocol specification here installation bash npm install socket io save how to use the following example attaches socket io to a plain node js http server listening on port 3000 js var server require http createserver var io require socket io server io on connection function client client on event function data client on disconnect function server listen 3000 standalone js var io require socket io io on connection function client io listen 3000 in conjunction with express starting with 3 0 express applications have become request handler functions that you pass to http or http server instances you need to pass the server to socket io and not the express application function also make sure to call listen on the server not the app js var app require express var server require http createserver app var io require socket io server io on connection function … server listen 3000 in conjunction with koa like express js koa works by exposing an application as a request handler function but only by calling the callback method js var app require koa var server require http createserver app callback var io require socket io server io on connection function … server listen 3000 documentation please see the documentation here contributions are welcome debug logging socket io is powered by debug in order to see all the debug output run your app with the environment variable debug including the desired scope to see the output from all of socket ios debugging scopes you can use debug socket io node myapp testing npm test this runs the gulp task test by default the test will be run with the source code in lib directory set the environmental variable test version to compat to test the transpiled es5 compat version of the code the gulp task test will always transpile the source code into es5 and export to dist first before running the test backers support us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities become a backer sponsors become a sponsor and get your logo on our readme on github with a link to your site become a sponsor license mit
