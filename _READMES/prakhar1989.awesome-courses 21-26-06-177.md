wide range of clinical problems and their associated computational challenges the practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients ranging from ekg readings to mri images to electronic health records this poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patients test results “does this patient have a normal heart rhythm ” or to address vital questions about large populations “is there any clinical condition that affects the risks of alzheimer” in cs5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state of the art research projects syllabus lectures assignments cs 5724 evolutionary computation cornell university this course will cover advanced topics in evolutionary algorithms and their application to open ended computational design the field of evolutionary computation tries to address large scale optimization and planning problems through stochastic population based methods it draws inspiration from evolutionary processes in nature and in engineering and also serves as abstract models for these phenomena evolutionary processes are generally weak methods that require little information about the problem domain and hence can be applied across a wide variety of applications they are especially useful for open ended problem domains for which little formal knowledge exists and the number of parameters is undefined such as for the general engineering design process this course will provide insight to a variety of evolutionary computation paradigms such as genetic algorithms genetic programming and evolutionary strategies as well as governing dynamics of co evolution arms races and mediocre stable states new methods involving symbiosis models and pattern recognition will also be presented the material will be intertwined with discussions of representations and results for design problems in a variety of problem domains including software electronics and mechanics syllabus lectures assignments cs 6452 evolutionary computation cornell university cs6452 focuses on datacenter networks and services the emerging demand for web services and cloud computing have created need for large scale data centers the hardware and software infrastructure for datacenters critically determines the functionality performance cost and failure tolerance of applications running on that datacenter this course will examine design alternatives for both the hardware networking infrastructure and the software infrastructure for datacenters syllabus lectures cs 6630 realistic image synthesis cornell university cs6630 is an introduction to physics based rendering at the graduate level starting from the fundamentals of light transport we will look
