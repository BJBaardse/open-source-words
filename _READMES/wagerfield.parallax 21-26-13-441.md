parallax engine that reacts to the orientation of a smart device where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available the position of the cursor is used instead check out the demo to see it in

com ajax libs parallax 3 1 0 parallax min js script to your markup done many thanks to the fine folks over at cdnjs for hosting our library 1 1 b beginners head over to the releases section download compiled zip from the latest release extract the zip archive and locate the parallax js and parallax min js files use parallax js if you want to snoop around in the code use parallax min js for deployment because it has a smaller file size copy the file of your choice into your project directory so far so good 1 1 c professionals npm i s parallax js you will then find the source code in node modules parallax js src parallax js and the browserified babelified uglified production ready version in node modules parallax js dist parallax min js 1 2 preparations include the script if you use the compiled version either downloaded from the releases page or copied from the dist folder include the script like any other javascript library script src path to parallax js script of course when youve installed via npm and use browserify babel you can also simply do import parallax from parallax js or const parallax require parallax js create your html elements each parallax js instance needs a container element the scene youre free to identify it by any means you want but for now lets use an id html div id scene div per default all direct child elements of the scene will become moving objects the layers you can change this to a custom query selector but again were going with the easiest approach for now html div id scene div my first layer div div my second layer div div while all other options and parameters are optional with sane defaults and can be set programatically each layer needs a data depth attribute the movement applied to each layer will be multiplied by its depth attribute html div id scene div data depth 0 2 my first layer div div data depth 0 6 my second layer div div 1 3 run parallax as soon as your dom is ready and loaded you can create a new parallax js instance providing your scene element as first parameter javascript var scene document getelementbyid scene var parallaxinstance new parallax scene thats it youre running parallax js now 2 configuration 2 1 programmatic vs declarative most configuration settings can be declared either as data value attribute of the scene element or property of the configuration object the programmatic approach will take priority over the data value attributes set in the html some options can also be set at run time via instance methods declarative html div data relative input true id scene div data depth 0 2 my first layer div div data depth 0 6 my second layer div div programmatic javascript var scene document getelementbyid scene var parallaxinstance new parallax scene relativeinput true using methods at runtime javascript parallaxinstance friction 0 2 0 2 2 2 configuration options relativeinput property relativeinput attribute data relative input value boolean default false makes mouse input relative to the position of the scene element no effect when gyroscope is used cliprelativeinput property cliprelativeinput attribute data clip relative input value boolean default false clips mouse input to the bounds of the scene this means the movement stops as soon as the edge of the scene element is reached by the cursor no effect when gyroscope is used or hoveronly is active hoveronly property hoveronly attribute data hover only value boolean default false parallax will only be in effect while the cursor is over the scene element otherwise all layers move back to their initial position works best in combination with relativeinput no effect when gyroscope is used inputelement property inputelement attribute data input element method setinputelement htmlelement value null or htmlelement string default null allows usage of a different element for cursor input the configuration property expects an htmlelement the data value attribute a query selector string will only work in combination with relativeinput setting hoveronly might make sense too no effect when gyroscope is used calibratex calibratey property calibratex calibratey attribute data calibrate x data calibrate y method calibrate x y value boolean default false for x true for y caches the initial x y axis value on initialization and calculates motion relative to this no effect when cursor is used invertx inverty property invertx inverty attribute data invert x data invert y method invert x y value boolean default true inverts the movement of the layers relative to the input setting both of these values to false will cause the layers to move with the device motion or cursor limitx limity property limitx limity attribute data limit x data limit y method limit x y value false or integer default false limits the movement of layers on the respective axis leaving this value at false gives complete freedom to the movement scalarx scalary property scalarx scalary attribute data scalar x data scalar y method scalar x y value float default 10 0 multiplies the input motion by this value increasing or decreasing the movement speed and range frictionx frictiony property frictionx frictiony attribute data friction x data friction y method friction x y value float between 0 and 1 default 0 1 amount of friction applied to the layers at 1 the layers will instantly go to their new positions everything below 1 adds some easing the default value of 0 1 adds some sensible easing try 0 15 or 0 075 for some difference originx originy property originx originy attribute data origin x data origin y method origin x y value float between 0 and 1 default 0 5 x and y origin of the mouse input the default of 0 5 refers to the center of the screen or element 0 is the left x axis or top y axis border 1 the right or bottom no effect when gyroscope is used precision property precision attribute data precision value integer default 1 decimals the element positions will be rounded to 1 is a sensible default which you should not need to change in the next few years unless you have a very interesting and unique setup selector property selector attribute data selector value null or string default null string that will be fed to queryselectorall on the scene element to select the layer elements when null will simply select all direct child elements use layer for legacy behaviour selecting only child elements having the class name layer pointerevents property pointerevents attribute data pointer events value boolean default false set to true to enable interactions with the scene and layer elements when set to the default of false the css attribute pointer events none will be applied for performance reasons setting this to true alone will not be enough to fully interact with all layers since they will be overlapping you have to either set position absolute on all layer child elements or keep pointerevents at false and set pointer events all for the interactable elements only onready property onready value null or function default null callback function that will be called as soon as the parallax instance has finished its setup this might currently take up to 1000ms calibrationdelay 2 3 methods in addition to the configuration methods outlined in the section above there are a few more publicly accessible methods enable enables a disabled parallax instance disable disables a running parallax instance destroy completely destroys a parallax instance allowing it to be garbage collected version returns the version number of the parallax library 4 development 4 1 running the project clone the repository git clone git github com wagerfield parallax git open the working directory cd parallax install dependencies npm install run development server gulp watch open http localhost 9000 in browser 4 2 opening an issue if you need help relating the direct usage of this library in a project of yours provide us with a working running example of your work this can be a github repository a zip file containing your work a project on codepen or jsfiddle you name it do not complain about something not working without giving us some way to help you thank you 4 3 known issues svg bug in ms edge it seems ms edge does not support the children or queryselectorall methods for svg elements 5 faq how can i use this library with jquery jquery will not prevent you from using this library in any way if you want to use jquery for selecting your parallax scene element you can do so too javascript var scene scene get 0 var parallaxinstance new parallax scene how can i interact with my layers check out the section on the configuration option pointerevents above how do i get the demo files to work either download compiled with examples zip from the github releases section or follow section 4 1 6 information 6 1 license this project is licensed under the terms of the mit license enjoy 6 2 authors matthew wagerfield wagerfield ren√© roth website
