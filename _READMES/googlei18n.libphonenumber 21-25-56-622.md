what is it googles common java c and javascript library for parsing formatting and validating international phone numbers the java version is optimized for running on smartphones and is used by the android framework since 4 0 ice cream sandwich quick links reporting an issue want to send a pull request see the contribution guidelines check the frequently asked questions fun falsehoods programmers believe about phone numbers look for readmes in directories relevant to the code youre interested in for contributors and porters how to run the java demo for porters how to make metadata changes highlights of functionality parsing formatting and validating phone numbers for all countries regions of the world getnumbertype gets the type of the number based on the number itself able to distinguish fixed line mobile toll free premium rate shared cost voip personal numbers uan pager and voicemail whenever feasible isnumbermatch gets a confidence level on whether two numbers could be the same getexamplenumber and getexamplenumberfortype provide valid example numbers for all countries regions with the option of specifying which type of example phone number is needed

to a phone number demo java the java demo is updated with a slight delay after the github release last demo update v8 9 9 if this number is lower than the latest releases version number we are between releases and the demo may be at either version javascript the javascript demo may be run at various tags this link will take you to master java code to include the java code in your application either integrate with maven see wiki or download the latest jars from the maven repository javadoc javadoc is automatically updated to reflect the latest release at https javadoc io doc com googlecode libphonenumber libphonenumber versioning and announcements we generally choose the release number following these guidelines if any of the changes pushed to master since the last release are incompatible with the intent specification of an existing libphonenumber api or may cause libphonenumber java c or js clients to have to change their code to keep building we publish a major release for example if the last release were 7 7 3 the new one would be 8 0 0 if any of those changes enable clients to update their code to take advantage of new functionality and if clients would have to roll back these changes in the event that the release was marked as bad we publish a minor release for example wed go from 7 7 3 to 7 8 0 otherwise including when a release contains only metadata changes we publish a sub minor release e g 7 7 3 to 7 7 4 sometimes we make internal changes to the code or metadata that while not affecting compatibility for clients could affect compatibility for porters of the library for such changes we make announcements to libphonenumber discuss such changes are not reflected in the version number and we would publish a sub minor release if there were no other changes want to get notified of new releases during most of the year excepting holidays and extenuating circumstances we release fortnightly we update release tags and document detailed release notes we also send an announcement to libphonenumber discuss for every release quick examples lets say you have a string representing a phone number from switzerland this is how you parse normalize it into a phonenumber object java string swissnumberstr 044 668 18 00 phonenumberutil phoneutil phonenumberutil getinstance try phonenumber swissnumberproto phoneutil parse swissnumberstr ch catch numberparseexception e system err println numberparseexception was thrown e tostring at this point swissnumberproto contains json country code 41 national number 446681800 phonenumber is a class that was originally auto generated from phonenumber proto with necessary modifications for efficiency for details on the meaning of each field refer to resources phonenumber proto now let us validate whether the number is valid java boolean isvalid phoneutil isvalidnumber swissnumberproto returns true there are a few formats supported by the formatting method as illustrated below java produces 41 44 668 18 00 system out println phoneutil format swissnumberproto phonenumberformat international produces 044 668 18 00 system out println phoneutil format swissnumberproto phonenumberformat national produces 41446681800 system out println phoneutil format swissnumberproto phonenumberformat e164 you could also choose to format the number in the way it is dialed from another country java produces

found in the unit tests third party ports several third party ports of the phone number library are known to us we share them here in case theyre useful for developers however we emphasize that these ports are by developers outside the libphonenumber project we do not evaluate their quality or influence their maintenance processes c https github com twcclegg libphonenumber csharp go https github

alternatives to our own versions android optimized our java version loads the metadata from class getresourcesasstream and asks that android apps follow the android loading best practices of repackaging the metadata and loading from assetmanager open themselves faq if you dont want to do this check out the port at https github com michaelrocks libphonenumber android which does repackage the metadata and use assetmanager open and may be depended on without needing those specific loading optimizations from clients javascript if you dont want to use our version which depends on closure there are several other options including https github com catamphetamine libphonenumber js a stripped down rewrite about 110 kb in size and https github com seegno google libphonenumber a browserify compatible wrapper around the original unmodified library installable via npm which packs the google closure library about 420 kb in size
