laravel 5 ide helper generator for laravel 4 x check version 1 11 complete phpdocs directly from the source check out this laracasts video for a quick introduction explanation php artisan ide helper generate phpdoc generation for laravel facades php artisan ide helper models phpdocs for models php artisan ide helper meta phpstorm meta file this package generates a file that your ide understands so it can provide accurate autocompletion generation is done based on the files in your project so they are always up to date if you dont want to generate it you can add a pre generated file to the root folder of your laravel project but this isnt as up to date as self generated files generated version for l5 https gist github com barryvdh 5227822 generated version for lumen https gist github com barryvdh be17164b0ad51f832f20 generated phpstorm meta file https gist github com barryvdh bb6ffc5d11e0a75dba67 note you do need codecomplice for sublime text https github com spectacles codecomplice install require this package with composer using the following command bash composer require barryvdh laravel ide helper after updating composer add the service provider to the providers array in config app php php barryvdh\laravelidehelper\idehelperserviceprovider class laravel 5 5 uses package auto discovery so doesnt require you to manually add the serviceprovider to install this package on only development systems add the dev flag to your composer command bash composer require dev barryvdh laravel ide helper in laravel instead of adding the service provider in the config app php file you can add the following code to your app providers appserviceprovider php file within the register method php public function register if this app environment production this app register \barryvdh\laravelidehelper\idehelperserviceprovider class this will allow your application to load the laravel ide helper on non production enviroments automatic phpdoc generation for laravel facades you can now re generate the docs yourself for future updates bash php artisan ide helper generate note bootstrap compiled php has to be cleared first so run php artisan clear compiled before generating you can configure your composer json to do this after each commit js scripts post update cmd illuminate\\foundation\\composerscripts postupdate php artisan ide helper generate php artisan ide helper meta you can also publish the config file to change implementations ie interface to specific class or set defaults for helpers or sublime bash php artisan vendor publish provider barryvdh\laravelidehelper\idehelperserviceprovider tag config the generator tries to identify the real class but if it cannot be found you can define it in the config file some classes need a working database connection if you do not have a default working connection some facades will not be included you can use an in memory sqlite driver by adding the m option you can choose to include helper files this is not enabled by default but you can override it with the helpers h option the illuminate support helpers php is already set up but you can add remove your own files in the config file automatic phpdocs for models you need to require doctrine dbal 2 3 in your own composer json to get database columns bash composer require doctrine dbal if you dont want to write your properties yourself you can use the command php artisan ide helper models to generate phpdocs based on table columns relations and getters setters you can write the comments directly to your model file using the write w option by default you are asked to overwrite or write to a separate file ide helper models php you can force no with nowrite n please make sure to backup your models before writing the info it should keep the existing comments and only append new properties methods the existing phpdoc is replaced or added if not found with the reset r option the existing phpdocs are ignored and only the newly found columns relations are saved as phpdocs bash php artisan ide helper models post php an eloquent model post property integer id property integer author id property string title property string text property \illuminate\support\carbon created at property \illuminate\support\carbon updated at property read \user author property read \illuminate\database\eloquent\collection \comment comments by default models in app models are scanned the optional argument tells what models to use also outside app models bash php artisan ide helper models post user you can also scan a different directory using the dir option relative from the base path bash php artisan ide helper models dir path to models dir app src model you can publish the config file php artisan vendor publish and set the default directories models can be ignored using the ignore i option bash php artisan ide helper models ignore post user note with namespaces wrap your model name in double quotes php artisan ide helper models api\user or escape the slashes api\\user for properly recognition of model methods i e paginate findorfail you should extend \eloquent or add php mixin \eloquent for your model class automatic phpdocs generation for laravel fluent methods if you need phpdocs support for fluent methods in migration for example php table string somestring nullable index after publishing vendor simply change the include fluent line your config ide helper php file into php include fluent true and then run php artisan ide helper generate you will now see all of the fluent methods are recognized by your ide phpstorm meta for container instances its possible to generate a phpstorm meta file to add support for factory design pattern for laravel this means we can make phpstorm understand what kind of object we are resolving from the ioc container for example events will return an illuminate\events\dispatcher object so with the meta file you can call app events and it will autocomplete the dispatcher methods bash php artisan ide helper meta php app events fire \app make events fire var \illuminate\foundation\application app app make events fire when the key is not found it uses the argument as class name app app\someclass pre generated example https gist github com barryvdh bb6ffc5d11e0a75dba67 note you might need to restart phpstorm and make sure phpstorm meta php is indexed note when you receive a fatalexception about a class that is not found check your config for example remove s3 as cloud driver when you dont have s3 configured remove redis serviceprovider when you dont use it lumen install this package is focused on laravel development but it can also be used in lumen with some workarounds because lumen works a little different as it is like a barebone version of laravel and the main configuration parameters are instead located in bootstrap app php some alterations must be made enabling facades while laravel ide helper can generate automatically default facades for code hinting lumen doesnt come with facades activated if you plan in using them you must enable them under the create the application section uncommenting this line php app withfacades from there you should be able to use the create alias function to add additional facades into your application adding the service provider you can install laravel ide helper in app providers appserviceprovider php and uncommenting this line that registers the app service providers so it can properly load php app register app\providers\appserviceprovider class if you are not using that line that is usually handy to manage gracefully multiple laravel lumen installations you will have to add this line of code under the register service providers section of your bootstrap app php php if app environment production app register \barryvdh\laravelidehelper\idehelperserviceprovider class after that laravel ide helper should work correctly during the generation process the script may throw exceptions saying that some class s doesnt exist or there are some undefined indexes this is normal as lumen has some default packages stripped away like cookies storage and session if you plan to add these packages you will have to add them manually and create additional facades if needed adding additional facades currently lumen ide helper doesnt take into account additional facades created under bootstrap app php using create alias so you need to create a config app php file and add your custom aliases under an aliases array again like so php return aliases customaliasone example\support\facades\customaliasone class customaliastwo example\support\facades\customaliastwo class after you run php artisan ide helper generate its recommended but not mandatory to rename config app php to something else until you have to re generate the docs or after passing to production enviroment lumen 5 1 will read this file for configuration parameters if it is present and may overlap some configurations if it is completely populated license the laravel ide helper generator is open sourced software licensed under the mit license
