available bash sudo gem install cocoapods pod setup change to the directory of your xcode project bash cd path to myproject touch podfile edit podfile edit your podfile and add residemenu bash platform ios 6 0 pod residemenu 4 0 7 install into your xcode project bash pod install open your project in xcode from the xcworkspace file not the usual project file bash open myproject xcworkspace please note that if your installation fails it may be because you are installing with a version of git lower than cocoapods is expecting please ensure that you are running git 1 8 0 by executing git version you can get a full picture of the installation details by executing pod install verbose manual install all you need to do is drop residemenu files into your project and add include residemenu

example create a subclass of residemenu in this example we call it demorootviewcontroller in the storyboard designate the root views owner as demorootviewcontroller make sure to import residemenu h in demorootviewcontroller h add more view controllers to your storyboard and give them identifiers leftmenuviewcontroller rightmenuviewcontroller and contentviewcontroller note that in the new xcode the identifier is called storyboard id and can be found in the identity inspector add a method awakefromnib to demorootviewcontroller m with the following code objective c void awakefromnib self
