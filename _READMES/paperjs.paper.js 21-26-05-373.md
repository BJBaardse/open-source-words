paper js the swiss army knife of vector graphics scripting if you want to work with paper js simply download the latest stable version from http paperjs org download website http paperjs org discussion forum http groups google com group paperjs mainline source code https github com paperjs paper js twitter paperjs latest releases http paperjs org download pre built development versions prebuilt module and prebuilt dist branches installing paper js the recommended way to install and maintain paper js as a dependency in your project is through the node js package manager npm for browsers node js or electron as well as through bower for browsers if npm or bower is already installed simply type one of these commands in your project folder sh npm install paper or bower install paper upon execution you will find a paper folder inside the projects node modules bower components folder for more information on how to install node js and npm read the chapter installing node js and npm which version to use the various distributions come with two different pre build versions of paper js in minified and normal variants paper full js – the full version for the browser including paperscript support and acorn js paper core js – the core version for the browser without paperscript support nor acorn js you can use this to shave off some bytes and compilation time when working with javascript directly installing node js and npm node js comes with the node package manager npm there are many tutorials explaining the different ways to install node js on different platforms it is generally not recommended to install node js through os supplied package managers as the its development cycles move fast and these versions are often out of date on macos homebrew is a good option if one version of node js that is kept up to date with brew upgrade is enough http treehouse github io installation guides mac node mac html nvm can be used instead to install and maintain multiple versions of node js on the same platform as often required by different projects https nodesource com blog installing node js tutorial using nvm on mac os x and ubuntu homebrew is recommended on macos also if you intend to install paper js with rendering to the canvas on node js as described in the next paragraph for linux see http nodejs org download to locate 32 bit and 64 bit node js binaries as well as sources or use nvm as described in the paragraph above installing paper js for node js paper js comes in three different versions on npm paper paper jsdom and paper jsdom canvas depending on your use case you need to required a different one paper is the main library and can be used directly in a browser context e g a web browser or worker paper jsdom is a shim module for node js offering headless use with svg importing and exporting through jsdom paper jsdom canvas is a shim module for node js offering canvas rendering through node canvas as well as svg importing and exporting through jsdom in order to install paper jsdom canvas you need the cairo graphics library installed in your system installing cairo and pango on macos the easiest way to install cairo is through homebrew by issuing the command brew install cairo pango note that currently there is an issue on macos with cairo if the above causes errors the following will most likely fix it pkg config path opt x11 lib pkgconfig npm install paper also whenever you would like to update the modules you will need to execute pkg config path opt x11 lib pkgconfig npm update if you keep forgetting about this requirement or would like to be able to type simple and clean commands add this to your bash profile file pkg config for pango cairo export pkg config path usr local lib pkgconfig opt x11 lib pkgconfig after adding this line your commands should work in the expected way npm install paper npm update installing cairo pango and all other dependencies on debian ubuntu linux sudo apt get install pkg config libcairo2 dev libpango1 0 dev libssl dev libjpeg62 dev libgif dev you might also need to install the build essential package if you dont usually build from c sources sudo apt get install build essential after cairo has been installed you should now be able to install the paper js module with jsdom and canvas rendering from npm npm install paper jsdom canvas installing paper js with node canvas for electron node canvas is a native dependency in order to build it for use of paper jsdom canvas in electron which is likely to use a different version of v8 than the node binary installed in your system you need to manually specify the location of electrons headers follow these steps to do so electron — using native node modules development the main paper js source tree is hosted on github git is required to create a clone of the repository and can be easily installed through your preferred package manager on your platform get the source git clone recursive git github com paperjs paper js git cd paper js to refresh your clone and fetch changes from origin run git fetch origin to update the jsdoc toolkit submodule used to generate the documentation run git submodule update init recursive setting up for building as of 2016 paper js uses gulp js for building and has a couple of dependencies as bower and npm modules read the chapter installing node js npm and bower if you still need to install these in order to be able to build paper js after checking out the repository paper has dependencies that need to be installed install them by issuing the following commands from the paper js directory npm install it is also recommended to install gulp js globally so you can easier execute the build commands from anywhere in the command line npm install g gulp building the library the paper js sources are distributed across many separate files organised in subfolders inside the src folder to compile them all into distributable files you can run the build task gulp build you will then find the built library files inside the dist folder named paper full js and paper core js along with their minified versions read more about this in which version to use running directly from separate source files as a handy alternative to building the library after each change to try it out in your scripts there is the load task that replaces the built libraries with symbolic links to the scrc load js script this script then load the library directly from all the separate source files in the src folder through the prepro js javascript preprocessing library this means you can switch between loading from sources and loading a built library simply by running gulp load and to go back to a built library gulp build note that your paperscripts examples do not need to change they can keep loading dist paper full js which will always do the right thing note also that src load js handles both browsers and node js as supported by prepro js other build tasks create a final zipped distribution file inside the dist folder gulp dist and since dist is the default task this is the same gulp branch structure since the release of version 0 9 22 paper js has adopted aspects of the git flow workflow all development is taking place in the develop branch which is only merged into master when a new release occurs as of version 0 9 26 the dist folder is excluded on all branches and the building is now part of the npm publish process by way of the prepublish script we also offer prebuilt versions of the latest state of the develop branch on prebuilt module and prebuilt dist building the documentation similarly to building the library you can run the docs task to build the documentation gulp docs your docs will then be located at dist docs testing paper js was developed and tested from day 1 using proper unit testing through jquerys qunit to run the tests after any change to the librarys source simply open index html inside the test folder in your web browser there should be a green bar at the top meaning all tests have passed if the bar is red some tests have not passed these will be highlighted and become visible when scrolling down if you are testing on chrome some of the tests will fail due to the browsers cors restrictions in order to run the browser based tests on chrome you need to run a local web server through gulp js the following command will handle it for you and will also open the browser at the right address straight away gulp test browser you can also run the unit tests through phantomjs in gulp directly on the command line gulp test phantom to test the node js version of paper js use this command gulp test node and to test both the phantomjs and node js environments together simply run gulp test contributing the main paper js source tree is hosted on github thus you should create a fork of the repository in which you perform development see http help github com forking we prefer that you send a pull request on github http help github com pull requests which will then be merged into the official main line repository you need to sign the paper js cla to be able to contribute see below also in your first contribution add yourself to the end of authors md which of course is optional get the source for contributing if you want to contribute to the project you will have to make a fork then do this git clone recursive git github com yourusername paper js git cd paper js git remote add upstream git github com paperjs paper js git to then fetch changes from upstream run git fetch upstream creating and submitting a patch as mentioned above we prefer that you send a pull request on github create a fork of the upstream repository by visiting https github com paperjs paper js fork if you feel insecure heres a great guide http help github com forking clone of your repository git clone https yourusername github com yourusername paper js git this is important create a so called topic branch based on the develop branch git checkout tb name of my patch develop where name of my patch is a short but descriptive name of the patch youre about to create dont worry about the perfect name though you can change this name at any time later on hack make your changes additions etc commit them then push them to your github fork git push origin name of my patch send a pull request to the upstream repositorys owner by visiting your repositorys site at github i e https github com yourusername paper js and press the pull request button make sure you are creating the pull request to the develop branch not the master branch heres a good guide on pull requests http help github com pull requests use one topic branch per feature dont mix different kinds of patches in the same branch instead merge them all together into your develop branch or develop everything in your develop branch and then cherry pick and merge into the different topic branches git provides for an extremely flexible workflow which in many ways causes more confusion than it helps you when new to collaborative software development the guides provided by github at http help github com are a really good starting point and reference if you are fixing an issue a convenient way to name the branch is to use the issue number as a prefix like this git checkout tb issue 937 feature add text styling contributor license agreement before we can accept any
