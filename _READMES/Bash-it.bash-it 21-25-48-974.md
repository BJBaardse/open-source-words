bash it bash it is a collection of community bash commands and scripts for bash 3 2 and a shameless ripoff of oh my zsh smiley includes autocompletion themes aliases custom functions a few stolen pieces from steve losh and more bash it provides a solid framework for using developing and maintaining shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work if youre using the bourne again shell bash on a regular basis and have been looking for an easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under control then bash it is for you stop polluting your bin directory and your bashrc file fork clone bash it and start hacking away contributing installation install options via docker updating help search syntax searching with negations using search to enable or disable components disabling ascii color custom scripts aliases themes and functions themes uninstalling misc help out contributors contributing please take a look at the contribution guidelines before reporting a bug or providing a new feature the development guidelines have more information on some of the internal workings of bash it please feel free to read through this page if youre interested in how bash it loads its components installation check out a clone of this repo to a location of your choice such as git clone depth 1 https github com bash it bash it git bash it run bash it install sh it automatically backs up your bash profile or bashrc depending on your os edit your modified config bash profile or bashrc file in order to customize bash it check out available aliases completions and plugins and enable the ones you want to use see the next section for more details install options the install script can take the following options interactive asks the user which aliases completions and plugins to enable silent ask nothing and install using default settings no modify config do not modify the existing config file bash profile or bashrc when run without the interactive switch bash it only enables a sane default set of functionality to keep your shell clean and to avoid issues with missing dependencies feel free to enable the tools you want to use after the installation when you run without the no modify config switch the bash it installer automatically modifies replaces your existing config file use the no modify config switch to avoid unwanted modifications e g if your bash config file already contains the code that loads bash it note keep in mind how bash load its configuration files bash profile for login shells and in macos in terminal emulators like terminal app or iterm2 and bashrc for interactive shells default mode in most of the gnu linux terminal emulators to ensure that bash it is loaded correctly a good practice is sourcing bashrc into bash profile to keep things working in all the scenarios to achieve this you can add this snippet in your bash profile if f bashrc then bashrc fi refer to the official bash documentation to get more info install using docker you can try bash it in an isolated environment without changing any local files via a docker container bash shell v4 4 with bash it bats and bash completion based on alpine linux docker pull ellerbrock bash it have a look at our bash it docker repository for further information updating to update bash it to the latest version simply run bash bash it update thats all if you are using an older version of bash it its possible that some functionality has changed or that the internal structure of how bash it organizes its functionality has been updated for these cases we provide a migrate command bash bash it migrate this command will automatically migrate the bash it structure to the latest version the migrate command is run automatically if you run the update enable or disable commands help screens bash bash it show aliases shows installed and available aliases bash it show completions shows installed and available completions bash it show plugins shows installed and available plugins bash it help aliases shows help for installed aliases bash it help completions shows help for installed completions bash it help plugins shows help for installed plugins search if you need to quickly find out which of the plugins aliases or completions are available for a specific framework programming language or an environment you can search for multiple terms related to the commands you use frequently search will find and print out modules with the name or description matching the terms provided syntax bash bash it search term1 term2 term3 as an example a ruby developer might want to enable everything related to the commands such as ruby rake gem bundler and rails search command helps you find related modules so that you can decide which of them youd like to use bash ❯ bash it search ruby rake gem bundle irb rails aliases bundler rails plugins chruby chruby auto ruby completions bundler gem rake currently enabled modules will be shown in green searching with negations you can prefix a search term with a to exclude it from the results in the above example if we wanted to hide chruby and chruby auto we could change the command as follows bash ❯ bash it search ruby rake gem bundle irb rails chruby aliases bundler rails plugins ruby completions bundler gem rake using search to enable or disable components by adding a enable or disable to the search command you can automatically enable all modules that come up as a result of a search query this could be quite handy if you like to enable a bunch of components related to the same topic disabling ascii color to remove non printing non ascii characters responsible for the coloring of the search output you can set environment variable no color enabled components will then be shown with a checkmark bash ❯ no color 1 bash it search ruby rake gem bundle irb rails chruby aliases ✓bundler ✓rails plugins ✓ruby completions bundler gem rake custom scripts aliases themes and functions for custom scripts and aliases just create the following files theyll be ignored by the git repo aliases custom aliases bash completion custom completion bash lib custom bash plugins custom plugins bash custom themes custom theme name custom theme name theme bash anything in the custom directory will be ignored with the exception of custom example bash alternately if you would like to keep your custom scripts under version control you can set bash it custom in your bashrc to another location outside of the bash it folder in this case any bash file under every directory below bash it custom folder will be used themes there are over 50 bash it themes to pick from in bash it themes the default theme is bobby set bash it theme to the theme name you want or if youve developed your own custom theme outside of bash it themes point the bash it theme variable directly to the theme file examples bash use the powerline multiline theme export bash it theme powerline multiline use a theme outside of the bash it folder export bash it theme home foo my theme my theme theme bash you can easily preview the themes in your own shell using bash preview true bash it reload if youve created your own custom prompts wed love it if you shared with everyone else just submit a pull request you can see theme screenshots on wiki themes note bash it and some themes use utf 8 characters so to avoid strange behavior in your terminal set your locale to lc all en us utf 8 or the equivalent to your language if it isnt american english uninstalling to uninstall bash it run the uninstall sh script found in the bash it directory cd bash it uninstall sh this will restore your previous bash profile after the uninstall script finishes remove the bash it directory from your machine rm rf bash it and start a new shell misc bash profile aliases bash it creates a reload alias that makes it convenient to reload your bash profile when you make changes additionally if you export bash it automatic reload after config change as a non null value bash it will automatically reload itself after activating or deactivating plugins aliases or completions prompt version control check bash it provides prompt themes the ability to check and display version control information for the current directory the information is retrieved for each directory and can slow down the navigation of projects with a large number of files and folders turn version control checking off to prevent slow directory navigation within large projects bash it provides a flag scm check within the bash profile file that turns off on version control information checking and display within all themes version control checking is on by default unless explicitly turned off set scm check to false to turn off version control checks for all themes export scm check false set scm check to true the default value to turn on version control checks for all themes export scm check true note it is possible for themes to ignore the scm check flag and query specific version control information directly for example themes that use functions like git prompt vars skip the scm check flag to retrieve and display git prompt information if you turned version control checking off and you still see version control information within your prompt then functions like git prompt vars are most likely the reason why git prompt bash it has some nice features related to git continue reading to know more about these features repository info in the prompt bash it can show some information about git repositories in the shell prompt the current branch tag or commit you are at how many commits the local branch is ahead or behind from the remote branch and if you have changes stashed additionally you can view the status of your working copy and get the count of staged unstaged and untracked files this feature is controlled through the flag scm git show details as follows set scm git show details to true the default value to show the working copy details in your prompt export scm git show details true set scm git show details to false to dont show it export scm git show details false note if using scm git show minimal info true then the value of scm git show details is ignored remotes and remote branches in some git workflows you must work with various remotes for this reason bash it can provide some useful information about your remotes and your remote branches for example the remote on you are working or if your local branch is tracking a remote branch you can control this feature with the flag scm git show remote info as follows set scm git show remote info to auto the default value to activate it only when more than one remote is configured in the current repo export scm git show remote info auto set scm git show remote info to true to always activate the feature export scm git show remote info true set scm git show remote info to false to disable the feature export scm git show remote info false note if using scm git show minimal info true then the value of scm git show remote info is ignored untracked files by default the git status command shows information about untracked files this behavior can be controlled through command line flags or git configuration files for big repositories ignoring untracked files can make git faster bash it uses git status to gather the repo information it shows in the prompt so in some circumstances it can be useful to instruct bash it to ignore these files you can control this behavior with the flag scm git ignore untracked set scm git ignore untracked to false the default value to get information about untracked files export scm git ignore untracked false set scm git ignore untracked to true to ignore untracked files export scm git ignore untracked true also with this flag to false bash it will not show the repository as dirty when the repo has untracked files and will not display the count of untracked files note if you set in git configuration file the option to ignore untracked files this flag has no effect and bash it will ignore untracked files always git user in some environments it is useful to know the value of the current git user which is used to mark all new commits for example any organization that uses the practice of pair programming will typically author each commit with combined names of the two authors when another pair uses the same pairing station the authors are changed at the beginning of the session to get up and running with this technique run gem install pivotal git scripts and then edit your pairs file according to the specification on the gems homepage after that you should be able to run git pair kg as to set the author to eg konstantin gredeskoul and alex saxby assuming theyve been added to the pairs file please see gems documentation for more information to enable the display of the current pair in the prompt you must set scm git show current user to true once set the scm current user variable will be automatically populated with the initials of the git author s it will also be included in the default git prompt even if you do not have git pair installed as long as your user name is set your initials will be computed from your name and shown in the prompt you can control the prefix and the suffix of this component using the two variables export scm theme current user preffix ☺︎ and export scm theme current user suffix ☺︎ note if using scm git show minimal info true then the value of scm git show current user is ignored git show minimal status info to speed up the prompt while still getting minimal git status information displayed such as the value of head and whether there are any dirty objects you can set export scm git show minimal info true ignore repo status when working in repos with a large codebase bash it can slow down your prompt when checking the repo status to avoid it there is an option you can set via git config to disable checking repo status in bash it to disable checking the status in the current repo git config add bash it hide status 1 but if you would like to disable it globally and stop checking the status for all of your repos git config global add bash it hide status 1 setting this flag globally has the same effect as scm check true but only for git repos pass function renamed to passgen the bash it pass function has been renamed to passgen in order to avoid a naming conflict with the pass password manager in order to minimize the impact on users of the legacy bash it pass function bash it will create the alias pass that calls the new passgen function if the pass password manager command is not found on the path default behavior this behavior can be overridden with the bash it legacy pass flag as follows set bash it legacy pass to true to force bash it to always create the pass alias to passgen export bash it legacy pass true unset bash it legacy pass to have bash it return to default behavior unset bash it legacy pass proxy support if you are working in a corporate environment where you have to go through a proxy server for internet access then you know how painful it is to configure the os proxy variables in the shell especially if you are switching between environments e g office with proxy and home without proxy the bash shell and many shell tools use the following variables to define the proxy to use http proxy and http proxy defines the proxy server for http requests https proxy and https proxy defines the proxy server for https requests all proxy and all proxy used by some tools for the same purpose as above no proxy and no proxy comma separated list of hostnames that dont have to go through the proxy bash its proxy plugin allows to enable and disable these variables with a simple command to start using the proxy plugin run the following bash bash it enable plugin proxy bash it also provides support for enabling disabling proxy settings for various shell tools the following backends are currently supported in addition to the shells environment variables git svn npm ssh the proxy plugin changes the configuration files of these tools to enable or disable the proxy settings bash it uses the following variables to set the shells proxy settings when you call enable proxy these variables are best defined in a custom script in bash its custom script folder bash it custom e g bash it custom proxy env bash bash it http proxy and bash it https proxy define the proxy url to be used e g http localhost 1234 bash it no proxy a comma separated list of proxy exclusions e g 127 0 0 1 localhost once you have defined these variables and have run reload to load the changes you can use the following commands to enable or disable the proxy settings in your current shell enable proxy this sets the shells proxy environment variables and configures proxy support in your svn npm and ssh configuration files disable proxy this unsets the shells proxy environment variables and disables proxy support in your svn npm and ssh configuration files there are many more proxy commands e g for changing the local git projects proxy settings run glossary proxy to show the available proxy functions with a short description help out we think everyone has their own custom scripts accumulated over time and so following in the footsteps of oh my zsh bash it is a framework for easily customizing your bash shell everyones got a custom toolbox so lets start making them even better as a community send us a pull request and well merge it as long as it looks good if you change an existing command please give an explanation why that will help a lot when we merge your changes in please take a look at the contribution guidelines
