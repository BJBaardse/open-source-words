use cases setup status documentation contact welcome noms is a decentralized database philosophically descendant from the git version control system like git noms is versioned by default all previous versions of the database are retained you can trivially track how the database evolved to its current state easily and efficiently compare any two versions or even rewind and branch from any previous version synchronizable instances of a single noms database can be disconnected from each other for any amount of time then later reconcile their changes efficiently and correctly unlike git noms is a database so it also primarily stores structured data not files and directories see the noms type system scales well to large amounts of data and concurrent clients supports atomic transactions a single instance of noms is cp but noms is typically run in production backed by s3 in which case it is effectively ca supports efficient indexes see noms prolly trees features a flexible query model see graphql a noms database can reside within a file system or in the cloud the built in nbs chunkstore implementation provides two back ends which provide persistence for noms databases one for storage in a file system and one for storage in an s3 bucket finally because noms is content addressed it yields a very pleasant programming model working with noms is declarative you dont insert new data update existing data or delete old data you simply declare what the data ought to be right now if you commit the same data twice it will be deduplicated because of content addressing if you commit almost the same data only the part that is different will be written use cases decentralization because noms is very good at sync it makes a decent basis for rich collaborative fully decentralized applications clientdb coming someday embed noms into mobile applications making it easier to build offline first fully synchronizing mobile applications setup shell you probably want to add this to your environment export noms version next 1 go get github com attic labs noms cmd noms go install github com attic labs noms cmd noms run import some data shell go install github com attic labs noms samples go csv csv import curl https data cityofnewyork us api views kku6 nxdu rows csv accesstype download tmp data csv csv import tmp data csv tmp noms nycdemo explore shell noms show tmp noms nycdemo should show go struct commit meta struct meta date 2017 09 19t19 33 01z inputfile tmp data csv parents set value 236 items struct row countamericanindian 0 countasiannonhispanic 3 countblacknonhispanic 21 countcitizenstatustotal 44 countcitizenstatusunknown 0 countethnicitytotal 44 status data format we are fairly confident in the core data format and plan to support noms database version 7 and forward if you create a database with noms today future versions will have migration tools to pull your databases forward roadmap we plan to implement the following for noms version 8 x horizontal scalability done see nbs x automatic merge done see commitoptions policy and the noms merge subcommand x query language done see ngql garbage collection https github com attic labs noms issues 3374 x optional fields https github com attic labs noms issues 2327 implement migration https github com attic labs noms issues 3363 fix sync performance with long commit chains https github com attic labs noms issues 2233 various other smaller bugs and improvements learn more about noms for the decentralized web the decentralized database learn the basics technical overview tour the cli command line interface tour tour the go api go sdk tour contact us interested in using noms awesome we would be happy to work with you to help understand whether noms is a fit for your problem reach out at mailing list twitter
