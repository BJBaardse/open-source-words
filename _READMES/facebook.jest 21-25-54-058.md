jest 🃏 delightful javascript testing 👩🏻‍💻 developer ready complete and ready to set up javascript testing solution works out of the box for any react project 🏃🏽 instant feedback fast interactive watch mode runs only test files related to changed files and is optimized to give signal quickly 📸 snapshot testing capture snapshots of react trees or other serializable values to simplify testing and to analyze how state changes over time getting started generated getting started start install jest using yarn bash yarn add dev jest or via npm bash npm install save dev jest the minimum supported node version is v6 0 0 by default if you need to support node 4 refer to the compatibility issues section lets get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers first create a sum js file javascript function sum a b return a b module exports sum then create a file named sum test js this will contain our actual test javascript const sum require sum test adds 1 2 to equal 3 expect sum 1 2 tobe 3 add the following section to your package json json scripts test jest finally run yarn test and jest will print this message bash pass sum test js ✓ adds 1 2 to equal 3 5ms you just successfully wrote your first test using jest this test used expect and tobe to test that two values were exactly identical to learn about the other things that jest can test see using matchers running from command line you can run jest directly from the cli if its globally available in your path e g by yarn global add jest with variety of useful options heres how to run jest on files matching my test using config json as a configuration file and display a native os notification after the run bash jest my test notify config config json if youd like to learn more about running jest through the command line take a look at the jest cli options page additional configuration using babel babel is automatically handled by jest using babel jest you dont need install anything extra for using babel note if you are using a babel version 7 then you need to install babel core 7 0 0 0 and babel core with the following command bash yarn add dev babel core 7 0 0 0 babel core dont forget to add a babelrc file in your projects root folder for example if you are using es6 and react js with the babel preset env and babel preset react presets json presets env react you are now set up to use all es6 features and react specific syntax note if you are using a more complicated babel configuration using babels env option keep in mind that jest will automatically define node env as test it will not use development section like babel does by default when no node env is set note if youve turned off transpilation of es modules with the option modules false you have to make sure to turn this on in your test environment json presets env modules false react env test presets env react note babel jest is automatically installed when installing jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project to avoid this behavior you can explicitly reset the transform configuration option json package json jest transform using webpack jest can be used in projects that use webpack to manage assets styles and compilation webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools refer to the webpack guide to get started using typescript to use typescript in your tests you can use ts jest generated getting started end documentation learn more about using jest on the official site getting started guides api reference configuring jest badge show the world youre using jest → md tested with jest https img shields io badge tested with jest 99424f svg https github com facebook jest jest https jestjs io img jest badge svg https github com facebook jest contributing development of jest happens in the open on github and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements read below to learn how you can take part in improving jest code of conduct facebook has adopted a code of conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated contributing guide read our contributing guide to learn about our development process how to propose bugfixes and improvements and how to build and test your changes to jest good first issues to help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope this is a great place to get started credits this project exists thanks to all the people who contribute backers thank you to all our backers 🙏 sponsors support this project by becoming a sponsor your logo will show up here with a link to your website license jest is mit licensed
