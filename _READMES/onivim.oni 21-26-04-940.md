collective become a backer on bountysource sponsors via opencollective gold sponsors silver sponsors introduction oni is a new kind of editor focused on maximizing productivity combining modal editing with features you expect in modern editors oni is built with neovim and inspired by vscode atom lighttable and emacs the vision of oni is to build an editor that allows you to go from thought to code as easily as possible bringing together the raw editing power of vim the feature capabilities of atom vscode and a powerful and intuitive extensibility model wrapped up in a beautiful package this repository is under active development and until 1 0 please consider everything unstable check out releases for the latest binaries or build oni from source consider making a donation via

out our minimal configuration installation we have installation guides for each platform windows mac linux the latest binaries are available on our releases page and if youd prefer to build from source check out our development guide goals the goal of this project is to provide both the full fledged vim experience with no compromises while pushing forward to enable new productivity scenarios modern ux the vim experience should not be compromised by terminal limitations rich plugin development using javascript instead of viml cross platform support across windows os x and linux batteries included rich features are available out of the box minimal setup needed to be productive performance no compromises vim is fast and oni should be fast too ease learning curve without sacrificing the vim experience vim is an incredible tool for manipulating text at the speed of thought with a composable modal command language it is no wonder that vim usage is still prevalent today however going from thought to code has some different challenges than going from thought to text code editors today provide several benefits that help to reduce cognitive load when writing code and that benefit is tremendously important not only in terms of pure coding efficiency and productivity but also in making the process of writing code enjoyable and fun the goal of this project is to give an editor that gives the best of both worlds the power speed and flexibility of using vim for manipulating text as well as the rich tooling that comes with an ide we want to make coding as efficient fast and fun as
