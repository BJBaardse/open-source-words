definitelytyped the repository for high quality typescript type definitions also see the definitelytyped org website although information in this readme is more up to date you can also read this readme in spanish what are declaration files see the typescript handbook how do i get them npm this is the preferred method this is only available for typescript 2 0 users for example sh npm install save dev types node the types should then be automatically included by the compiler see more in the handbook for an npm package foo typings for it will be at types foo if you cant find your package look for it on typesearch if you still cant find it check if it bundles its own typings this is usually provided in a types or typings field in the package json or just look for any d ts files in the package and manually include them with a reference path other methods these can be used by typescript 1 0 typings nuget use preferred alternatives nuget dt type publishing has been turned off manually download from the master branch of this repository you may need to add manual references how can i contribute definitelytyped only works because of contributions by users like you test before you share your improvement with the world use it yourself test editing an existing package to add new features you can use module augmentation you can also directly edit the types in node modules types foo index d ts or copy them from there and follow the steps below test a new package add to your tsconfig json json baseurl types typeroots types you can also use src types create types foo index d ts containing declarations for the module foo you should now be able import from foo in your code and it will route to the new type definition then build and run the code to make sure your type definition actually corresponds to what happens at runtime once youve tested your definitions with real code make a pr then follow the instructions to edit an existing package or create a new package make a pull request once youve tested your package you can share it on definitelytyped first fork this repository install node and run npm install edit an existing package cd types my package to edit make changes remember to edit tests if you make breaking changes do not forget to update a major version you may also want to add yourself to definitions by section of the package header this will cause you to be notified via your github username whenever someone makes a pull request or issue about the package do this by adding your name to the end of the line as in definitions by alice https github com alice bob https github com bob or if there are more people it can be multiline typescript definitions by alice https github com alice bob https github com bob steve https github com steve john https github com john if there is a tslint json run npm run lint package name otherwise run tsc in the package directory when you make a pr to edit an existing package dt bot should mention previous authors if it doesnt you can do so yourself in the comment associated with the pr create a new package if you are the library author and your package is written in typescript bundle the autogenerated declaration files in your package instead of publishing to definitelytyped if you are adding typings for an npm package create a directory with the same name if the package you are adding typings for is not on npm make sure the name you choose for it does not conflict with the name of a package on npm you can use npm info foo to check for the existence of the foo package your package should have this structure file purpose index d ts this contains the typings for the package foo tests ts this contains sample code which tests the typings this code does not run but it is type checked tsconfig json this allows you to run tsc within the package tslint json enables linting generate these by running npx dts gen dt name my package name template module if you have npm â‰¥ 5 2 0 npm install g dts gen and dts gen dt name my package name template module otherwise see all options at dts gen you may edit the tsconfig json to add new files to add target es6 needed for async functions to add to lib or to add the jsx compiler option definitelytyped members routinely monitor for new prs though keep in mind that the number of other prs may slow things down for a good example package see base64 js common mistakes first follow advice from the handbook formatting either use all tabs or always use 4 spaces function sum nums number number use readonlyarray if a function does not write to its parameters interface foo new foo this defines a type of objects that are new able you probably want declare class foo constructor const class new iclass prefer to use a class declaration class class constructor instead of a new able constant getmeat t t if a type parameter does not appear in the types of any parameters you dont really have a generic function you just have a disguised type assertion prefer to use a real type assertion e g getmeat as number example where a type parameter is acceptable function id t value t t example where it is not acceptable function parsejson t json string t exception new map string number is ok using the types function and object is almost never a good idea in 99 of cases its possible to specify a more specific type examples are x number number for functions and x number y number for objects if there is no certainty at all about the type any is the right choice not object if the only known fact about the type is that its some object use the type object not object or key string any var foo string any when any is used in a union type the resulting type is still any so while the string portion of this type annotation may look useful it in fact offers no additional typechecking over simply using any depending on the intention acceptable alternatives could be any string or string object removing a package when a package bundles its own types types should be removed from definitelytyped to avoid confusion you can remove it by running npm run not needed typingspackagename asofversion sourcerepourl libraryname typingspackagename this is the name of the directory to delete asofversion a stub will be published to types foo with this version should be higher than any currently published version sourcerepourl this should point to the repository that contains the typings libraryname descriptive name of the library e g angular 2 instead of angular2 if ommitted will be identical to typingspackagename any other packages in definitelytyped that referenced the deleted package should be updated to reference the bundled types to do this add a package json with dependencies foo x y z if a package was never on definitelytyped it does not need to be added to notneededpackages json lint to lint a package just add a tslint json to that package containing extends dtslint dt json all new packages must be linted if a tslint json turns rules off this is because that hasnt been fixed yet for example js extends dtslint dt json rules this package uses the function type and it will take effort to fix ban types false to indicate that a lint rule truly does not apply use tslint disable rule name or better tslint disable next line rule name to assert that an expression is of a given type use expecttype to assert that an expression causes a compile error use expecterror js expecttype void f 1 expecterror f one for more details see dtslint readme test by running npm run lint package name where package name is the name of your package this script uses dtslint faq what exactly is the relationship between this repository and the types packages on npm the master branch is automatically published to the types scope on npm thanks to types publisher ive submitted a pull request how long until it is merged it depends but most pull requests will be merged within a week prs that have been approved by an author listed in the definitions header are usually merged more quickly prs for new definitions will take more time as they require more review from maintainers each pr is reviewed by a typescript or definitelytyped team member before being merged so please be patient as human factors may cause delays check the pr burndown board to see progress as maintainers work through the open prs my pr is merged when will the types npm package be updated npm packages should update within a few hours if its been more than 24 hours ping ryancavanaugh and andy ms on the pr to investigate im writing a definition that depends on another definition should i use reference types or an import if the module youre referencing is an external module uses export use an import if the module youre referencing is an ambient module uses declare module or just declares globals use reference types i notice some packages having a package json here usually you wont need this when publishing a package we will normally automatically create a package json for it a package json may be included for the sake of specifying dependencies heres an example we do not allow other fields such as description to be defined manually also if you need to reference an older version of typings you must do that by adding dependencies types foo x y z to the package json some packages have no tslint json and some tsconfig json are missing noimplicitany true noimplicitthis true or strictnullchecks true then they are wrong you can help by submitting a pull request to fix them can i request a definition here are the currently requested definitions what about type definitions for the dom if types are part of a web standard they should be contributed to tsjs lib generator so that they can become part of the default lib dom d ts a package uses export but i prefer to use default imports can i change export to export default if you are using typescript 2 7 or later use esmoduleinterop in your project otherwise if default imports work in your environment e g webpack systemjs esm consider turning on the allowsyntheticdefaultimports compiler option do not change the type definition if it is accurate for an npm package export is accurate if node p require foo is the export and export default is accurate if node p require foo default is the export i want to use features from typescript 2 1 or above then you will have to add a comment to the last line of your definition header after definitions https github com definitelytyped definitelytyped typescript version 2 1 i want to add a dom api not present in typescript by default this may belong in tsjs lib generator see the guidelines there if the standard is still a draft it belongs here use a name beginning with dom and include a link to the standard as the project link in the header when it graduates draft mode we may remove it from definitelytyped and deprecate the associated types package i want to update a package to a new major version if you intend to continue updating the older version of the package you may create a new subfolder with the current version e g v2 and copy existing files to it if so you will need to update the relative paths in tsconfig json as well as tslint json add path mapping rules to ensure that tests are running against the intended version for example history v2 tsconfig json looks like json compileroptions baseurl typeroots paths history history v2 files index d ts history tests ts if there are other packages on definitelytyped that are incompatible with the new version you will need to add path mappings to the old version you will also need to do this for packages depending on packages depending on the old version for example react router depends on history 2 so react router tsconfig json has a path mapping to history history v2 transitively react router bootstrap which depends on react router also adds a path mapping in its tsconfig json also reference types will not work with path mapping so dependencies must use import how do i write definitions for packages that can be used globally and as a module the typescript handbook contains excellent general information about writing definitions and also this example definition file which shows how to create a definition using es6 style module syntax while also specifying objects made available to the global scope this technique is demonstrated practically in the definition for big js which is a library that can be loaded globally via script tag on a web page or imported via require or es6 style imports to test how your definition can be used both when referenced globally or as an imported module create a test folder and place two test files in there name one yourlibraryname global test ts and the other yourlibraryname module test ts the global test file should exercise the definition according to how it would be used in a script loaded on a web page where the library is available on the global scope in this scenario you should not specify an import statement the module test file should exercise the definition according to how it would be used when imported including the import statement s if you specify a files property in your tsconfig json file be sure to include both test files a practical example of this is also available on the big js definition please note that it is not required to fully exercise the definition in each test file it is sufficient to test only the globally accessible elements on the global test file and fully exercise the definition in the module test file or vice versa what about scoped packages types for a scoped package foo bar should go in types foo bar note the double underscore when dts gen is used to scaffold a scoped package the paths property has to be manually adapted in the generated tsconfig json to correctly reference the scoped package json paths foo bar foo bar the file history in github looks incomplete github doesnt support file history for renamed files use git log follow instead should i add an empty namespace to a package that doesnt export a module to use es6 style imports some packages like chai http export a function importing this module with an es6 style import in the form import as foo from foo leads to the error error ts2497 module foo resolves to a non module entity and cannot be imported using this construct this error can be suppressed by merging the function declaration with an empty namespace of the same name but this practice is discouraged this is a commonly cited stack overflow answer regarding this matter it is more appropriate to import the module using the import foo require foo syntax or to use a default import like import foo from foo if using the allowsyntheticdefaultimports flag if your module runtime
