bundler or with npm shell npm install g parcel bundler parcel can take any type of file as an entry point but an html or javascript file is a good place to start if you link your main javascript file in the html using a relative path parcel will also process it for you and replace the reference with a url to the output file html html body script src index js script body html parcel has a development server built in which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports hot module replacement for fast development just point it at your entry file shell parcel index html now open http localhost 1234 in your browser if needed you can also override the default port with the p option add open to automatically open a browser see parceljs org for more documentation

with cache 2 64s why parcel there are many web application bundlers out there with huge adoption including webpack and browserify so why do we need another one the main reasons are around developer experience many bundlers are built around configuration and plugins and it is not uncommon to see applications with upwards of 500 lines of configuration just to get things working this configuration is not just tedious and time consuming but is also hard to get right and must be duplicated for each application oftentimes this can lead to sub optimized apps shipping to production parcel is designed to need zero configuration just point it at the entry point of your application and it does the right thing existing bundlers are also very slow large applications with lots of files and many dependencies can take minutes to build which is especially painful during development when things change all the time file watchers can help with rebuilds but the initial launch is often still very slow parcel utilizes worker processes to compile your code in parallel utilizing modern multicore processors this results in a huge speedup for initial builds it also has a file system cache which saves the compiled results per file for even faster subsequent startups finally existing bundlers are built around string loaders transforms where the transform takes in a string parses it does some transformation and generates code again oftentimes this ends up causing many parses and code generation runs on a single file which is inefficient instead parcels transforms work on asts so that there is one parse many transforms and one code generation per file how it works parcel transforms a tree of assets into a tree of bundles many other bundlers are fundamentally based around javascript assets with other formats tacked on for example by default inlined as strings into js files parcel is file type agnostic it will work with any type of assets the way youd expect with no configuration parcel takes as input a single entry asset which could be any file type js html css image etc there are various asset types defined in parcel which know how to handle specific file types the assets are parsed their dependencies are extracted and they are transformed to their final compiled form this creates a tree of assets once the asset tree has been constructed the assets are placed into a bundle tree a bundle is created for the entry asset and child bundles are created for dynamic imports which cause code splitting to occur child bundles are also created when assets of a different type are imported for example if you imported a css file from javascript it would be placed into a sibling bundle to the corresponding javascript if an asset is required in more than one bundle it is hoisted up to the nearest common ancestor in the bundle tree so it is not included more than once after the bundle tree is constructed each bundle is written to a file by a packager specific to the file type the packagers know how to combine the code from each asset together into the final file that is loaded by a browser community all feedback and suggestions are welcome üí¨ join the community
