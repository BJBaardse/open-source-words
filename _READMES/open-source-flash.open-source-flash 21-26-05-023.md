petition to open source flash and shockwave spec edit the first letter is being written if you want to contribute to it you can either make pull requests or join the gitter chat to help us organize it adobe is going to stop distributing and updating flash player and the shockwave player thats ok however flash along with its sister project shockwave is an important piece of internet history and killing flash and shockwave means future generations cant access the past games experiments and websites would be forgotten open sourcing flash and the shockwave spec would be a good solution to keep flash and shockwave projects alive safely for archive reasons dont know how but thats the beauty of open source you never know what will come up after you go open source there might be a way to convert swf fla drc dir to html5 canvas webgl webassembly or some might write a standalone player for it another possibility would be to have a separate browser were not saying flash and shockwave player should be preserved as is we understand that there can be licensed components you might not be able to release simply leave them out with a note explaining what was removed we will either bypass them or replace them with open source alternatives star this repository to sign the petition pull requests are also welcome add cool flash and shockwave links here and reasons to open source
