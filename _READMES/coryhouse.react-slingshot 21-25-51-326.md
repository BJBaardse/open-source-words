alongside the file under test the final built app is placed under dist these are the files you run in production delete the example app files once youre comfortable with how the example app works you can delete those files and begin creating your own app having issues see having issues initial machine setup install node 4 0 0 or greater 5 0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance need to run multiple versions of node use nvm install git disable safe write in your editor to assure hot reloading works properly complete the steps below for your operating system macos install watchman via brew install watchman or fswatch via brew install fswatch to avoid this issue which occurs if your macos has no appropriate file watching service installed linux run this to increase the

are copied to the project directory root this is easy to overlook if you copy this repository manually dont run the project from a symbolic link it may cause issues with file watches delete any eslintrc that youre storing in your user directory also disable any eslint plugin custom rules that youve enabled within your editor these will conflict with the eslint rules defined in this project make sure you dont have node env set to production on your machine if you do then the development dependencies wont be installed heres how to check install watchman with brew install watchman if you

watch script to esw webpack config src tools watch exit 0 note adding exit 0 will allow the npm scripts to ignore the status 1 and allow esw to print all warnings and errors ensure the eslint esw globally installed version matches the version used in the project this will ensure the esw keyword is resolved rebuild node sass with npm rebuild node sass if you are having and error like node sass
