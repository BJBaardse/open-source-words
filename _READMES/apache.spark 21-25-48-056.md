apache spark spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for big data it provides high level apis in scala java python and r and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis it also supports a rich set of higher level tools including spark sql for sql and dataframes mllib for machine learning graphx for graph processing and spark streaming for stream processing http spark apache org online documentation you can find the latest spark documentation including a programming guide on the project web page this readme file only contains basic setup instructions building spark spark is built using apache maven to build spark and its example programs run build mvn dskiptests clean package you do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre built package you can build spark using more than one thread by using the t option with maven see parallel builds in maven 3 more detailed documentation is available from the project site at building spark for general development tips including info on developing spark using an ide see useful developer tools interactive scala shell the easiest way to start using spark is through the scala shell bin spark shell try the following command which should return 1000 scala sc parallelize 1 to 1000 count interactive python shell alternatively if you prefer python you can use the python shell bin pyspark and run the following command which should also return 1000 sc parallelize range 1000 count example programs spark also comes with several sample programs in the examples directory to run one of them use bin run example class params for example bin run example sparkpi will run the pi example locally you can set the master environment variable when running examples to submit examples to a cluster this can be a mesos or spark url yarn to run on yarn and local to run locally with one thread or local n to run locally with n threads you can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the examples package for instance master spark host 7077 bin run example sparkpi many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given running tests testing first requires building spark once spark is built tests can be run using dev run tests please see the guidance on how to run tests for a module or individual tests there is also a kubernetes integration test see resource managers kubernetes integration tests readme md a note about hadoop versions spark uses the hadoop core library to talk to hdfs and other hadoop supported storage systems because the protocols have changed in different versions of hadoop you must build spark against the same version that your cluster runs please refer to the build documentation at specifying the hadoop version for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of hadoop including building for particular hive and hive thriftserver distributions configuration please refer to the configuration guide in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure spark contributing please review the contribution to spark guide for information on how to get started contributing to the project
