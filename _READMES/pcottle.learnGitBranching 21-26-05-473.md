learngitbranching learngitbranching is a git repository visualizer sandbox and series of educational tutorials and challenges its primary purpose is to help developers understand git through the power of visualization something thats absent when working on the command line you can input a variety of commands into learngitbranching lgb as commands are processed the nearby commit tree will dynamically update to reflect the effects of each command this visualization combined with tutorials and levels can help both beginners and intermediate developers polish their version control skills a quick demo is available here http pcottle github com learngitbranching demo or you can launch the application normally here http pcottle github com learngitbranching sandbox mode by default the application launches in sandbox mode with a basic repository already created here you can enter commands and mess around with a repository as much as you like keep in mind you can undo to undo the effects of the last command reset to start over with a clean slate works in levels too git clone to simulate remote repositories sandbox mode can be great for demonstrating something to a friend but the real learning is with levels levels type levels to see the available lessons challenges and which ones you have solved so far each level series aims to teach some high level git concept and each tab of levels separates major worlds of info like remote repositories versus local for some added fun there is a git golf concept where we keep track of how many commands you use to solve each level see if you can match all of our records sharing permalinks you can share a link to learngitbranching with an arbitrary set of commands that will execute upon load by using the command url parameter you will also likely want to disable the intro dialog for this case with the nodemo url param here is an example to get started level builder you can build levels with build level the dialog will walk you through the process and at the end you can export level to get a json blob paste that in a gist or directly into an issue and i can check it out merge in your changes you can also share this level directly with friends by having them run import level or simply specify a gist id in the url params like so http pcottle github io learngitbranching gist level id a84407351f9c9f0cb241 reporting bugs opening issues when reporting bugs try running the command debug copytree in your js console when in a state just before reproducing a bug this can avoid having to copy all the commands you used to get into a specific state i can then use the importtreenow command to get to that exact state how the app works contributing functionality learngitbranching is a pretty simple application from a technical perspective theres no backend database or any ajax requests its a 100 clientside application written in javascript the production version on github io literally just serves up an html page with some js and css the rest of the magic lies in the 9k lines of javascript p because the app contains a lot of code i have written everything into nodejs style modules the modules are packaged together with the browserify and then sent down in a format the browser can understand as of december 2013 ive migrated the build process to use grunt 0 4 since the older version was giving a lot of people build headaches it should be fairly rock solid now here is the high level process of the build the code is written into the node js modules which require other modules css is written into just one stylesheet there is not a whole ton of styling new html is written into a template html file template index html only needed for new views the app is built which outputs index html in the root directory css and js files in build directory if the app is being built for production then these css and js files are hashed to bust caches and tests are run thats it thus if you build the app locally all you have to do in order to run the app is just open up index html in the root directory of the repo pretty simple building yourself contributing functionality for contributing core functionality in the app youll probably want to test your changes at least once before submitting a pull request that means youll need the grunt js build tool to build the app http gruntjs com getting started youll also need npm to download all the dependencies of the project the general workflow steps are below git clone cd learngitbranching npm install to install all the node modules i depend on git checkout b newawesomefeature vim src js git index js some changes grunt fastbuild skips tests and linting faster build after building you can open up your browser to the index html file generated and see your changes vim src js git index js more changes grunt build runs tests and lint git commit am my new sweet feature git push go online and request a pull helpful folks a big shoutout to these
