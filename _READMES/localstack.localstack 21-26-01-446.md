localstack a fully functional local aws cloud stack localstack provides an easy to use test mocking framework for developing cloud applications currently the focus is primarily on supporting the aws cloud stack announcements 2018 01 10 help wanted please fill out this survey to support a research study on the usage of serverless and function as a service faas services conducted at chalmers university of technology the survey only takes 5 10 minutes of your time many thanks for your participation 2017 08 27 we need your support localstack is growing fast we now have thousands of developers using the platform on a regular basis last month we have recorded a staggering 100k test runs with 25k dynamodb tables 20k sqs queues 15k kinesis streams 13k s3 buckets and 10k lambda functions created locally for 0 costs more details to be published soon bug and feature requests are pouring in and we now need some support from you to keep the open source version actively maintained please check out open collective and become a backer or supporter of the project today thanks everybody for contributing ♥ 2017 07 20 please note starting with version 0 7 0 the docker image will be pushed and kept up to date under the new name localstack localstack this means that you may have to update your ci configurations please refer to the updated end user license agreement eula for the new versions the old docker image atlassianlabs localstack is still available but will not be maintained any longer overview localstack spins up the following core cloud apis on your local machine api gateway at http localhost 4567 kinesis at http localhost 4568 dynamodb at http localhost 4569 dynamodb streams at http localhost 4570 elasticsearch at http localhost 4571 s3 at http localhost 4572 firehose at http localhost 4573 lambda at http localhost 4574 sns at http localhost 4575 sqs at http localhost 4576 redshift at http localhost 4577 es elasticsearch service at http localhost 4578 ses at http localhost 4579 route53 at http localhost 4580 cloudformation at http localhost 4581 cloudwatch at http localhost 4582 ssm at http localhost 4583 additionally localstack provides a powerful set of tools to interact with the cloud services including a fully featured kcl kinesis client with python binding simple setup teardown integration for nosetests as well as an environment abstraction that allows to easily switch between local and remote cloud execution why localstack localstack builds on existing best of breed mocking testing tools most notably kinesalite dynalite and moto while these tools are awesome they lack functionality for certain use cases localstack combines the tools makes them interoperable and adds important missing functionality on top of them error injection localstack allows to inject errors frequently occurring in real cloud environments for instance provisionedthroughputexceededexception which is thrown by kinesis or dynamodb if the amount of read write throughput is exceeded actual http rest services all services in localstack allow actual http connections on a tcp port in contrast moto uses boto client proxies that are injected into all methods annotated with mock sqs these client proxies do not perform an actual rest call but rather call a local mock service method that lives in the same process as the test code language agnostic although localstack is written in python it works well with arbitrary programming languages and environments due to the fact that we are using the actual rest apis via http isolated processes all services in localstack run in separate processes the overhead of additional processes is negligible and the entire stack can easily be executed on any developer machine and ci server in moto components are often hard wired in ram e g when forwarding a message on an sns topic to an sqs queue the queue endpoint is looked up in a local hash map in contrast localstack services live in isolation separate processes available via http which fosters true decoupling and more closely resembles the real cloud environment pluggable services all services in localstack are easily pluggable and replaceable due to the fact that we are using isolated processes for each service this allows us to keep the framework up to date and select best of breed mocks for each individual service requirements make python both python 2 x and 3 x supported pip python package manager npm node js package manager java javac java 8 runtime environment and compiler mvn maven the build system for java installing the easiest way to install localstack is via pip pip install localstack once installed run the infrastructure using the following command localstack start note please do not use sudo or the root user localstack should be installed and started entirely under a local non root user if you have problems with permissions in macos x sierra install with pip install user localstack running in docker you can also spin up localstack in docker localstack start docker note that on macos you may have to run tmpdir private tmpdir localstack start docker if tmpdir contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by docker or using docker compose you need to clone the repository first docker compose up note that on macos you may have to run tmpdir private tmpdir docker compose up if tmpdir contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by docker configurations you can pass the following environment variables to localstack services comma separated list of service names and optional ports they should run on if no port is specified a default port is used service names basically correspond to the service names of the aws cli kinesis lambda sqs etc although localstack only supports a subset of them example value kinesis lambda 4569 sqs 4570 to start kinesis on the default port lambda on port 4569 and sqs on port 4570 default region aws region to use when talking to the api defaults to us east 1 hostname name of the host to expose the services internally defaults to localhost use this to customize the framework internal communication e g if services are started in different containers using docker compose hostname external name of the host to expose the services externally defaults to localhost this host is used e g when returning queue urls from the sqs service to the client use ssl whether to use https urls with ssl encryption defaults to false kinesis error probability decimal value between 0 0 default and 1 0 to randomly inject provisionedthroughputexceededexception errors into kinesis api responses dynamodb error probability decimal value between 0 0 default and 1 0 to randomly inject provisionedthroughputexceededexception errors into dynamodb api responses lambda executor method to use for executing lambda functions possible values are local run lambda functions in a temporary directory on the local machine docker run each function invocation in a separate docker container docker reuse create one docker container per function and reuse it across invocations for docker and docker reuse if localstack itself is started inside docker then the docker command needs to be available inside the container usually requires to run the container in privileged mode default is docker fallback to local if docker is not available lambda remote docker determines whether lambda code is copied or mounted into containers possible values are true default your lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by copying the zip file potentially slower it allows for remote execution where the host and the client are not on the same machine false your lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by mounting a volume potentially faster this requires to have the docker client and the docker host on the same machine data dir local directory for saving persistent data currently only supported for these services kinesis dynamodb elasticsearch s3 set it to tmp localstack data to enable persistence tmp localstack is mounted into the docker container leave blank to disable persistence default port web ui port for the web user interface dashboard default is 8080 service backend custom endpoint url to use for a specific service where service is the uppercase service name currently works for apigateway cloudformation dynamodb elasticsearch kinesis s3 sns sqs this allows to easily integrate third party services into localstack force noninteractive when running with docker disables the interactive and tty flags useful when running headless additionally the following read only environment variables are available localstack hostname name of the host where localstack services are available this is needed in order to access the services from within your lambda functions e g to store an item to dynamodb or s3 from lambda the variable localstack hostname is available for both local lambda execution lambda executor local and execution inside separate docker containers lambda executor docker accessing the infrastructure via cli or code you can point your aws cli to use the local infrastructure for example aws endpoint url http localhost 4568 kinesis list streams streamnames new check out awslocal a thin cli wrapper that runs commands directly against localstack no need to specify endpoint url anymore install it via pip install awscli local and then use it as follows awslocal kinesis list streams streamnames update use the environment variable localstack hostname to determine the target host inside your lambda function see configurations section for more details client libraries python https github com localstack localstack python client alternatively you can also use boto3 and use the endpoint url parameter when creating a connection more coming soon integration with nosetests if you want to use localstack in your integration tests e g nosetests simply fire up the infrastructure in your test setup method and then clean up everything in your teardown method from localstack services import infra def setup infra start infra async true def teardown infra stop infra def my app test here goes your test logic see the example test file tests test integration py for more details integration with java junit in order to use localstack with java the project ships with a simple junit runner and a junit 5 extension take a look at the example junit test in ext java when you run the test all dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed to a temporary directory in your system import cloud localstack localstacktestrunner import cloud localstack testutils runwith localstacktestrunner class public class mycloudapptest test public void testlocals3api amazons3 s3 testutils getclients3 list buckets s3 listbuckets or with junit 5 extendwith localstackextension class public class mycloudapptest additionally there is a version of the localstack test runner which runs in a docker container instead of installing localstack on the current machine the only dependency is to have docker installed locally the test runner will automatically pull the image and start the container for the duration of the test the container can be configured by using the localstackdockerproperties annotation runwith localstackdockertestrunner

symbolic link that cannot be mounted by docker see details here https bitbucket org atlassian localstack issues 40 getting mounts failed on docker compose up if you run into file permission issues on pip install under mac os e g permission denied library python 2 7 site packages six py then you may have to re install pip via homebrew see this discussion thread alternatively try installing with the user flag pip install user localstack if you are deploying within openshift please be aware the pod must run as root and the user must have capabilities added to the running pod in order to allow elasticsearch to be run as the non root localstack user the environment variable no proxy is rewritten by localstack internal requests will go straight via localhost bypassing any proxy configuration developing if you pull the repo in order to extend modify localstack run this command to install all the dependencies make install this will install the required pip dependencies in a local python virtualenv directory venv your global python packages will remain untouched as well as some node modules in localstack node modules depending on your system some pip npm modules may require additional native libs installed the makefile contains a target to conveniently run the local infrastructure for development make infra check out the developer guide which contains a few instructions on how to get started with developing and debugging features for localstack testing the project contains a set of unit and integration tests that can be kicked off via a make target make test web dashboard the
