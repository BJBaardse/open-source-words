angular seed â€” the seed for angularjs apps this project is an application skeleton for a typical angularjs web app you can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects the seed contains a sample angularjs application and is preconfigured to install the angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification the seed app doesnt do much just shows how to wire two controllers and views together getting started to get you started you can simply clone the angular seed repository and install the dependencies prerequisites you need git to clone the angular seed repository you can get git from here we also use a number of node js tools to initialize and test angular seed you must have node js and its package manager npm installed you can get them from here clone angular seed clone the angular seed repository using git git clone https github com angular angular seed git cd angular seed if you just want to start a new project without the angular seed commit history then you can do git clone depth 1 https github com angular angular seed git your project name the depth 1 tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data install dependencies we have two kinds of dependencies in this project tools and angular framework code the tools help us manage and test the application we get the tools we depend upon via npm the node package manager we get the angular code via bower a client side code package manager in order to run the end to end tests you will also need to have the java development kit jdk installed on your machine check out the section on end to end testing for more info we have preconfigured npm to automatically run bower so we can simply do npm install behind the scenes this will also call bower install after that you should find out that you have two new folders in your project node modules contains the npm packages for the tools we need app bower components contains the angular framework files note that the bower components folder would normally be installed in the root folder but angular seed changes this location through the bowerrc file putting it in the app folder makes it easier to serve the files by a web server run the application we have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server the simplest way to start this server is npm start now browse to the app at localhost 8000 index html directory layout app all of the source files for the application app css default stylesheet components all app specific modules version version related components version js version module declaration and basic version value service version test js version value service tests version directive js custom directive that returns the current app version version directive test js version directive tests interpolate filter js custom interpolation filter interpolate filter test js interpolate filter tests view1 the view1 view template and logic view1 html the partial template view1 js the controller logic view1 test js tests of the controller view2 the view2 view template and logic view2 html the partial template view2 js the controller logic view2 test js tests of the controller app js main application module index html app layout file the main html template file of the app index async html just like index html but loads js files asynchronously karma conf js config file for running unit tests with karma e2e tests end to end tests protractor conf js protractor config file scenarios js end to end scenarios to be run by protractor testing there are two kinds of tests in the angular seed application unit tests and end to end tests running unit tests the angular seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests these are written in jasmine which we run with the karma test runner we provide a karma configuration file to run them the configuration is found at karma conf js the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an test js suffix e g view1 test js the easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script npm test this script will start the karma test runner to execute the unit tests moreover karma will start watching the source and test files for changes and then re run the tests whenever any of them changes this is the recommended strategy if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality you can also ask karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit this is useful if you want to check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected the project contains a predefined script to do this npm run test single run running end to end tests the angular seed app comes with end to end tests again written in jasmine these tests are run with the protractor end to end test runner it uses native events and has special features for angular applications the configuration is found at e2e tests protractor conf js the end to end tests are found in e2e tests scenarios js protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds correctly therefore our web server needs to be serving up the application so that protractor can interact with it before starting protractor open a separate terminal window and run npm start in addition since protractor is built upon webdriver we need to ensure that it is installed and up to date the angular seed project is configured to do this automatically before running the end to end tests so you dont need to worry about it if you want to manually update the webdriver you can run npm run update webdriver once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running you can run the end to end tests using the supplied npm script npm run protractor this script will execute the end to end tests against the application being hosted on the development server note under the hood protractor uses the selenium standalone server which in turn requires the java development kit jdk to be installed on your local machine check this by running java version from the command line if jdk is not already installed you can download it here updating angular since the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers npm and bower you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies simply run the preconfigured script npm run update deps this will call npm update and bower update which in turn will find and install the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the package json and bower json files respectively loading angular asynchronously the angular seed project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously the special index async html is designed to support this style of loading for it to work you must inject a piece of angular javascript into the html page the project has a predefined script to help do this npm run update index async this will copy the contents of the angular loader js library file into the index async html page you can run this every time you update the version of angular that you are using serving the application files while angular is client side only technology and it is possible to create angular web apps that do not require a backend server at all we recommend serving the project files using a local web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions sandbox in browsers the sandbox implementation varies between browsers but quite often prevents things like cookies xhr etc to function properly when an html page is opened via the file scheme instead of http running the app during development the angular seed project comes preconfigured with a local development web server it is a node js tool called http server you can start this web server with npm start but you may choose to install the tool globally sudo npm install g http server then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running http server a localhost p 8000 alternatively you can choose to configure your own web server such as apache or nginx just configure your server to serve the files under the app directory running the app in production this really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system but the general rule is that all you need in production are the files under the app directory everything else should be omitted angular apps are really just a bunch of static html css and javascript files that need to be hosted somewhere they can be accessed by browsers if your angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means you need to figure out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if applicable usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through reverse proxying the backend server s and web server s continuous integration travis ci travis ci is a continuous integration service which can monitor github for new commits to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests the angular seed project contains a travis configuration file travis yml which will cause travis to run your tests when you push to github you will need to enable the integration between travis and github see the travis website for
