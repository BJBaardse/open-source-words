socketrocket license link a conforming websocket rfc 6455 client library for ios macos and tvos test results for socketrocket here you can compare to what modern browsers look like here socketrocket currently conforms to all core 300 of autobahns fuzzing tests aside from two utf 8 ones where it is merely non strict tests 6 4 2 and 6 4 4 features design tls wss support including self signed certificates seems to perform quite well supports http proxies supports ipv4 ipv6 supports ssl certificate pinning sends ping and can process pong events asynchronous and non blocking most of the work is done on a background thread supports ios macos tvos installing there are a few options choose one or just figure it out cocoapods add the following line to your podfile ruby pod socketrocket run pod install and you are all set carthage add the following line to your cartfile github facebook socketrocket run carthage update and you should now have the latest version of socketrocket in your carthage folder using socketrocket as a sub project you can also include socketrocket as a subproject inside of your application if youd prefer although we do not recommend this as it will increase your indexing time significantly to do so just drag and drop the socketrocket xcodeproj file into your workspace api srwebsocket the web socket note srwebsocket will retain itself between void open and when it closes errors or fails this is similar to how nsurlconnection behaves unlike nsurlconnection srwebsocket wont retain the delegate interface objective c interface srwebsocket nsobject make it with this instancetype initwithurlrequest nsurlrequest request set this before opening property nonatomic weak id delegate open with this void open close it with this void close send a data void senddata nullable nsdata data error nserror error send a utf8 string void sendstring nsstring string error nserror error end srwebsocketdelegate you implement this objective c protocol srwebsocketdelegate optional void websocketdidopen srwebsocket websocket void websocket srwebsocket websocket didreceivemessagewithstring nsstring string void websocket srwebsocket websocket didreceivemessagewithdata nsdata data void websocket srwebsocket websocket didfailwitherror nserror error void websocket srwebsocket websocket didclosewithcode nsinteger code reason nullable nsstring reason wasclean bool wasclean end testing included are setup scripts for the python testing environment it comes packaged with vitualenv so all the dependencies are installed in userland to run the short test from the command line run bash make test to run all the tests run bash make test all the short tests dont include the performance tests the test harness is actually the bottleneck not socketrocket the first time this is run it may take a while to install the dependencies it will be smooth sailing after that you can also run tests inside xcode which runs the same thing but makes it easier to debug choose the socketrocket target run the test action âŒ˜ u testchat demo application socketrocket includes a demo app testchat it will chat with a listening websocket on port 9900 testchat server the sever takes a message and broadcasts it to all other connected clients it requires some dependencies though to run we also want to reuse the virtualenv we made when we ran the tests if you havent run the tests yet go into the socketrocket root directory and type bash make test this will set up your virtualenv now in your terminal bash source env bin activate pip install git https github com tornadoweb tornado git in the same terminal session start the chatroom server bash python testchatserver py chatroom py theres also a go implementation with the latest weekly where you can bash cd testchatserver go go run chatroom go chatting now start testchat app just run the target in the xcode project if you had it started already you can hit the refresh button to reconnect it should say connected on top to talk with the app open up your browser to http localhost 9000 and start chatting websocket server implementation recommendations socketrocket has been used with the following libraries tornado gos websocket package or gorillas version autobahn using its fuzzing client the tornado one is dirt simple and works like a charm ipython notebook uses it too its much easier to configure handlers and routes than in autobahn twisted contributing were glad youre interested in socketrocket and wed love to see where you take it please read our contributing guidelines prior to submitting a pull request
