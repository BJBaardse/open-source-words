learning rxjava for android by example this is a repository with real world useful examples of using rxjava with android it usually will be in a constant state of work in progress wip ive also been giving talks about learning rx using many of the examples listed in this repo learning rxjava for android by example part 1 slides sf android meetup 2015 learning rx by example part 2 slides Ã¸redev 2016 examples background work concurrency using schedulers accumulate calls using buffer instant auto searching text listeners using subjects debounce networking with retrofit rxjava using zip flatmap

subjects orchestrating observable make parallel network calls then combine the result into a single data point using flatmap zip simple timeout example using timeout setup and teardown resources using using multicast playground description 1 background work concurrency using schedulers a common requirement is to offload lengthy heavy i o intensive operations to a background thread non ui thread and feed the results back to the ui main thread on completion this is a demo of how long running operations can be offloaded to a background thread after the operation is done we resume back on the main thread all using rxjava think of this as a replacement to asynctasks the long operation is simulated by a blocking thread sleep call since this is done in a background thread our ui is never interrupted to really see this example shine hit the button multiple times and see how the button click which is a ui operation is never blocked because the long operation only runs in the background 2 accumulate calls using buffer this is a demo of how events can be accumulated using the buffer operation a button is provided and we accumulate the number of clicks on that button over a span of time and then spit out the final results if you hit the button once youll get a message saying the button was hit once if you hit it 5 times continuously within a span of 2 seconds then you get a single log saying you hit that button 5 times vs 5 individual logs saying button hit once note if youre looking for a more foolproof solution that accumulates continuous taps vs just the number of taps within a time span look at the eventbus demo where a combo of the publish and buffer operators is used for a more detailed explanation you can also have a look at this blog post 3 instant auto searching text listeners using subjects debounce this is a demo of how events can be swallowed in a way that only the last one is respected a typical example of this is instant search result boxes as you type the word bruce lee you dont want to execute searches for b br bru bruce bruce bruce l etc but rather intelligently wait for a couple of moments make sure the user has finished typing the whole word and then shoot out a single call for bruce lee as you type in the input box it will not shoot out log messages at every single input character change but rather only pick the lastly emitted event i e input and log that this is the debounce throttlewithtimeout method in rxjava 4 networking with retrofit rxjava using zip flatmap retrofit from square is an amazing library that helps with easy networking even if you havent made the jump to rxjava just yet you really should check it out it works even better with rxjava and these are examples hitting the github api taken straight up from the android demigod developer jake whartons talk at netflix you can watch the talk at this link incidentally my motivation to use rxjava was from attending this talk at netflix note youre most likely to hit the github api quota pretty fast so send in an oauth token as a parameter if you want to keep running these examples often 5 two way data binding for textviews using publishsubject auto updating views are a pretty cool thing if youve dealt with angular js before they have a pretty nifty concept called two way data binding so when an html element is bound to a model entity object it constantly listens to changes on that entity and auto updates its state based on the model using the technique in this example you could potentially use a pattern like the presentation view model pattern with great ease while the example here is pretty rudimentary the technique used to achieve the double binding using a publish subject is much more interesting 6 simple and advanced polling using interval and repeatwhen this is an example of polling using rxjava schedulers this is useful in cases where you want to constantly poll a server and possibly get new data the network call is simulated so it forces a delay before return a resultant string there are two variants for this simple polling say when you want to execute a certain task every 5 seconds increasing delayed polling say when you want to execute a task first in 1 second then in 2 seconds then 3 and so on the second example is basically a variant of exponential backoff instead of using a retrywithdelay we use a repeatwithdelay here to understand the difference between retry when and repeat when i wouuld suggest dans fantastic post on the subject an alternative approach to delayed polling without the use of repeatwhen would be using chained nested delay observables see startexecutingwithexponentialbackoffdelay in the exponentialbackofffragment example 7 simple and advanced exponential backoff using delay and retrywhen exponential backoff is a strategy where based on feedback from a certain output we alter the rate of a process usually reducing the number of retries or increasing the wait time before retrying or re executing a certain process the concept makes more sense with examples rxjava makes it relatively simple to implement such a strategy my thanks to mike for suggesting the idea retry if error with exponential backoff say you have a network failure a sensible strategy would be to not keep retrying your network call every 1 second it would be smart instead nay elegant to retry with increasing delays so you try at second 1 to execute the network call no dice try after 10 seconds negatory try after 20 seconds no cookie try after 1 minute if this thing is still failing you got to give up on the network yo we simulate this behaviour using rxjava with the retrywhen operator retrywithdelay code snippet courtesy http stackoverflow com a 25292833 159825 another excellent implementation via sddamico https gist github com sddamico c45d7cdabc41e663bea1 this one includes support for jittering by leandrofavarin http leandrofavarin com exponential backoff rxjava operator with jitter also look at the polling example where we use a very similar exponential backoff mechanism repeat with exponential backoff another variant of the exponential backoff strategy is to execute an operation for a given number of times but with delayed intervals so you execute a certain operation 1 second from now then you execute it again 10 seconds from now then you execute the operation 20 seconds from now after a grand total of 3 times you stop executing simulating this behavior is actually way more simpler than the prevoius retry mechanism you can use a variant of the delay operator to achieve this 8 form validation using combinelatest thanks to dan lew for giving me this idea in the fragmented podcast episode 4 around the 4 30 mark combinelatest allows you to monitor the state of multiple observables at once compactly at a single location the example demonstrated shows how you can use combinelatest to validate a basic form there are 3 primary inputs for this form to be considered valid an email a password and a number the form will turn valid the text below turns blue p once all the inputs are valid if they are not an error is shown against the invalid inputs we have 3 independent observables that track the text input changes for each of the form fields rxandroids widgetobservable comes in handy to monitor the text changes after an event change is noticed from all 3 inputs the result is combined and the form is evaluated for validity note that the func3 function that checks for validity kicks in only after all 3 inputs have received a text change event the value of this technique becomes more apparent when you have more number of input fields in a form handling it otherwise with a bunch of booleans makes the code cluttered and kind of difficult to follow but using combinelatest all that logic is concentrated in a nice compact block of code i still use booleans but that was to make the example more readable 9 pseudo caching retrieve data first from a cache then a network call using concat concateager merge or publish we have two source observables a disk fast cache and a network fresh call typically the disk observable is much faster than the network observable but in order to demonstrate the working weve also used a fake slower disk cache just to see how the operators behave this is demonstrated using 4 techniques concat concateager merge publish selector merge takeuntil the 4th technique is probably what you want to use eventually but its interesting to go through the progression of techniques to understand why concat is great it retrieves information from the first observable disk cache in our case and then the subsequent network observable since the disk cache is presumably faster all appears well and the disk cache is loaded up fast and once the network call finishes we swap out the fresh results the problem with concat is that the subsequent observable doesnt even start until the first observable completes that can be a problem we want all observables to start simultaneously but produce the results in a way we expect thankfully rxjava introduced concateager which does exactly that it starts both observables but buffers the result from the latter one until the former observable finishes this is a completely viable option sometimes though you just want to start showing the results immediately assuming the first observable for some strange reason takes really long to run through all its items even if the first few items from the second observable have come down the wire it will forcibly be queued you dont necessarily want to wait on any observable in these situations we could use the merge operator it interleaves items as they are emitted this works great and starts to spit out the results as soon as theyre shown similar to the concat operator if your first observable is always faster than the second observable you wont run into any problems however the problem with merge is if for some strange reason an item is emitted by the cache or slower observable after the newer fresher observable it will overwrite the newer content click the merge slower disk button in the example to see this problem in action jakewharton and swankjesse contributions go to 0 in the real world this could be bad as it would mean the fresh data would get overridden by stale disk data to solve this problem you can use merge in combination with the super nifty publish operator which takes in a selector i wrote about this usage in a blog post but i have jedi jw to thank for reminding of this technique we publish the network observable and provide it a selector which starts emitting from the disk cache up until the point that the network observable starts emitting once the network observable starts emitting it ignores all results from the disk observable this is perfect and handles any problems we might have previously i was using the merge operator but overcoming the problem of results being overwritten by monitoring the resultage see the old pseudocachemergefragment example if youre curious to see this old implementation 10 simple timing demos using timer interval and delay this is a super simple and straightforward example which shows you how to use rxjavas timer interval and delay operators to handle a bunch of cases where you want to run a task at specific intervals basically say no to android timertasks cases demonstrated here run a single task after a delay of 2s then complete run a task constantly every 1s theres a delay of 1s before the first task fires off run a task constantly every 1s same as above but theres no delay before the first task fires off run a task constantly every 3s but after running it 5 times terminate automatically run a task a pause for sometime then execute task b then terminate 11 rxbus event bus using rxjava using rxrelay never terminating subjects and debouncedbuffer there are accompanying blog posts that do a much better job of explaining the details on this demo implementing an event bus with rxjava debouncedbuffer used for the fancier variant of the demo share publish refcount 12 persist data on activity rotations using subjects and retained fragments a common question thats asked when using rxjava in android is how do i resume the work of an observable if a configuration change occurs activity rotation language locale change etc this example shows you one strategy viz using retained fragments i started using retained fragments as worker fragments after reading this fantastic post by alex lockwood quite sometime back hit the start button and rotate the screen to your hearts content youll see the observable continue from where it left off there are certain quirks about the hotness of the source observable used in this example check my blog post out where i explain the specifics i have since rewritten this example using an alternative approach while the connectedobservable approach worked it enters the lands of multicasting which can be tricky thread safety refcount etc subjects on the other hand are far more simple you can see it rewritten using a subject here i wrote another blog post on how to think about subjects where i go into some specifics 13 networking with volley volley is another networking library introduced by google at io 13 a kind citizen of github contributed this example so we know how to integrate volley with rxjava 14 pagination with rx using subjects i leverage the simple use of a subject here honestly if you dont have your items coming down via an observable already like through retrofit or a network request theres no good reason to use rx and complicate things this example basically sends the page number to a subject and the subject handles adding the items notice the use of concatmap and the return of an observable list from itemsfromnetworkcall for kicks ive also included a paginationautofragment example this auto paginates without us requiring to hit a button it should be simple to follow if you got how the previous example works here are some other fancy implementations while i enjoyed reading them i didnt land up using them for my real world app cause personally i dont think its necessary matthias example of an rx based pager eugenes very comprehensive pagination sample recursive paging example 15 orchestrating observable make parallel network calls then combine the result into a single data point using flatmap zip the below ascii diagram expresses the intention of our next example with panache f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 are essentially network calls that when made give back a result thats needed for a future calculation flatmap f1 f3 flatmap zip f2 f4 final output \ \ f5 the code for this example has already been written by one mr skehlet in the interwebs head over to the gist for the code its written in pure java 6 so its pretty comprehensible if youve understood the previous examples ill flush it out here again when time permits or ive run out of other compelling examples 16 simple timeout example using timeout this is a simple example demonstrating the use of the timeout operator button 1 will complete the task before the timeout constraint while button 2 will force a timeout error notice how we can provide a custom observable that indicates how to react under a timeout exception 17 setup and teardown resources using using the operator using is relatively less known and notoriously hard to google its a beautiful api that helps to setup a costly resource use it and then dispose off in a clean way the nice thing about this operator is that it provides a mechansim to use potentially costly resources in a tightly scoped manner using setup use and dispose think db connections like realm instances socket connections thread locks etc 18 multicast playground multicasting in rx is like a dark art not too many folks know how to pull it off without concern this example condiers two subscribers in the forms of buttons and allows you to add remove subscribers at different points of time and see how the different operators behave under those circumstances the source observale is a timer interval observable and the reason this was chosen was to intentionally pick a non terminating observable so you can test confirm if your multicast experiment will leak i also gave a talk about multicasting in detail at 360 andev if you have the inclination and time i highly suggest watching that talk first specifically the multicast operator permutation segment and then messing around with the example here rx 2 x all the examples here have been migrated to use rxjava 2 x have a look at pr 83 to see the diff of changes between rxjava 1 and 2 whats different in rx 2 x we use david karnoks interop library in some cases as certain libraries like rxbindings rxrelays rxjava math etc have not been ported yet to 2 x contributing i try to ensure the examples are not overly contrived but reflect a real world usecase if you have similar useful examples demonstrating the use of rxjava feel free to send in a pull request im wrapping my head around rxjava too so if you feel theres a better way of doing one of the examples
