react grid layout react grid layout is a grid layout system much like packery or gridster for react unlike those systems it is responsive and supports breakpoints breakpoint layouts can be provided by the user or autogenerated rgl is react only and does not require jquery gif from production usage on bitmex com demo changelog webpackbin editable demo table of contents demos features installation usage responsive usage providing grid width grid layout props responsive grid layout props grid item props contribute todo list demos showcase basic no dragging resizing layout only messy layout autocorrect layout defined on children static elements adding removing elements saving layout to localstorage saving a responsive layout to localstorage minimum and maximum width height dynamic

application node modules react grid layout css styles css node modules react resizable css styles css usage use reactgridlayout like any other component the following example below will produce a grid with three items where users will not be able to drag or resize item a item b will be restricted to a minimum width of 2 grid blocks and a maximum width of 4 grid blocks users will be able to freely drag and resize item c js import gridlayout from react grid layout class myfirstgrid extends react component render layout is an array of objects see the demo for more complete usage var layout i a x 0 y 0 w 1 h 2 static true i b x 1 y 0 w 3 h 2 minw 2 maxw 4 i c x 4 y 0 w 1 h 2 return a b c you may also choose to set layout properties directly on the children js import gridlayout from react grid layout class myfirstgrid extends react component render return a b c usage without browserify webpack a module usable in a script tag is included here it uses a umd shim and excludes react so it must be otherwise available in your application either via requirejs or on window react responsive usage to make rgl responsive use the responsivereactgridlayout element js import responsive as responsivegridlayout from react grid layout class myresponsivegrid extends react component render lg layout1 md layout2 var layouts getlayoutsfromsomewhere return 1 2 3 when in responsive mode you should supply at least one breakpoint via the layouts property when using layouts it is best to supply as many breakpoints as possible especially the largest one if the largest is provided rgl will attempt to interpolate the rest you will also need to provide a width when using responsivereactgridlayout it is suggested you use the hoc widthprovider as per the instructions below for the time being it is not possible to supply responsive mappings via the data grid property on individual items but that is coming soon providing grid width both responsivereactgridlayout and reactgridlayout take width to calculate positions on drag events in simple cases a hoc widthprovider can be used to automatically determine width upon initialization and window resize events js import responsive widthprovider from react grid layout const responsivegridlayout widthprovider responsive class myresponsivegrid extends react component render lg layout1 md layout2 var layouts getlayoutsfromsomewhere return 1 2 3 this allows you to easily replace widthprovider with your own provider hoc if you need more sophisticated logic widthprovider accepts a single prop measurebeforemount if true widthprovider will measure the containers width before mounting children use this if youd like to completely eliminate any resizing animation on application component mount have a more complicated layout widthprovider is very simple and only listens to window resize events if you need more power and flexibility try the sizeme react hoc as an alternative to widthprovider grid layout props rgl supports the following properties see the source for the final word on this js basic props this allows setting the initial width on the server side this is required unless using the hoc or similar width number if true the container height swells and contracts to fit contents autosize boolean true number of columns in this layout cols number 12 a css selector for tags that will not be draggable for example draggablecancel mynondraggableareaclassname if you forget the leading it will not work draggablecancel string a css selector for tags that will act as the draggable handle for example draggablehandle mydraghandleclassname if you forget the leading it will not work draggablehandle string if true the layout will compact vertically verticalcompact boolean true compaction type compacttype vertical horizontal vertical layout is an array of object with the format x number y number w number h number the index into the layout must match the key used on each item component if you choose to use custom keys you can specify that key in the layout array objects like so i string x number y number w number h number layout array null if not provided use data grid props on children margin between items x y in px margin number number 10 10 padding inside the container x y in px containerpadding number number margin rows have a static height but you can change this based on breakpoints if you like rowheight number 150 flags isdraggable boolean true isresizable boolean true uses css3 translate instead of position top left this makes about 6x faster paint performance usecsstransforms boolean true if true grid items wont change position when being dragged over preventcollision boolean false callbacks callback so you can save the layout calls back with currentlayout

properties and changes are js name pxval e g lg 1200 md 996 sm 768 xs 480 breakpoint names are arbitrary but must match in the cols and layouts objects breakpoints object lg 1200 md 996 sm 768 xs 480

currentlayout layout alllayouts key keys layout void callback when the width changes so you can modify the layout as needed onwidthchange containerwidth number margin number number cols number containerpadding number number void grid item props rgl supports the following properties on grid items or layout items when initializing a grid build a layout array as in the first example above or attach this object as the data grid property to each of your child elements as in the second example note that if a grid item is provided but incomplete missing one of x y w or h an error will be thrown so you can correct your layout if no properties are provided for a grid item one will be generated with a width and height of 1 you can set minimums and maximums for each dimension this is for resizing it of course has no effect if resizing is disabled errors will be thrown if your mins and maxes overlap incorrectly or your initial dimensions are out of range any griditem properties defined directly will take precedence over globally set options for example if the layout has the property isdraggable false but the grid item has the prop isdraggable true the item will be draggable js a string corresponding to the component key i string these are all in grid units not pixels x number y number w number h number minw number 0 maxw number infinity minh number 0 maxh number infinity if true equal to isdraggable false isresizable false static boolean false if false will not be draggable overrides static isdraggable boolean true if false will not be resizable overrides static isresizable boolean true contribute if you have a feature request please add it as an issue or make a pull request if you have a bug to report please reproduce the bug in webpackbin to help us easily
