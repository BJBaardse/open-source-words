axios promise based http client for the browser and node js features make xmlhttprequests from the browser make http requests from node js supports the promise api intercept request and response transform request and response data cancel requests automatic transforms for json data client side support for protecting against xsrf browser support latest ✔ latest ✔ latest ✔ latest ✔ latest ✔ 8 ✔ installing using npm bash npm install axios using bower bash bower install axios using cdn html script src https unpkg com axios dist axios min js script example performing a get request js const axios require axios make a request for a user with a given id axios get user id 12345 then function response handle success console log response catch function error handle error console log error then function always executed optionally the request above could also be done as axios get user params id 12345 then function response console log response catch function error console log error then function always executed want to use async await add the async keyword to your outer function method async function getuser try const response await axios get user id 12345 console log response catch error console error error note async await is part of ecmascript 2017 and is not supported in internet explorer and older browsers so use with caution performing a post request js axios post user firstname fred lastname flintstone then function response console log response catch function error console log error performing multiple concurrent requests js function getuseraccount return axios get user 12345 function getuserpermissions return axios get user 12345 permissions axios all getuseraccount getuserpermissions then axios spread function acct perms both requests are now complete axios api requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios axios config js send a post request axios method post url user 12345 data firstname fred lastname flintstone js get request for remote image axios method get url http bit ly 2mtm3ny responsetype stream then function response response data pipe fs createwritestream ada lovelace jpg axios url config js send a get request default method axios user 12345 request method aliases for convenience aliases have been provided for all supported request methods axios request config axios get url config axios delete url config axios head url config axios options url config axios post url data config axios put url data config axios patch url data config note when using the alias methods url method and data properties dont need to be specified in config concurrency helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests axios all iterable axios spread callback creating an instance you can create a new instance of axios with a custom config axios create config js const instance axios create baseurl https some domain com api timeout 1000 headers x custom header foobar instance methods the available instance methods are listed below the specified config will be merged with the instance config axios request config axios get url config axios delete url config axios head url config axios options url config axios post url data config axios put url data config axios patch url data config request config these are the available config options for making requests only the url is required requests will default to get if method is not specified js url is the server url that will be used for the request url user method is the request method to be used when making the request method get default baseurl will be prepended to url unless url is absolute it can be convenient to set baseurl for an instance of axios to pass relative urls to methods of that instance baseurl https some domain com api transformrequest allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server this is only applicable for request methods put post and patch the last function in the array must return a string or an instance of buffer arraybuffer formdata or stream you may modify the headers object transformrequest function data headers do whatever you want to transform the data return data transformresponse allows changes to the response data to be made before it is passed to then catch transformresponse function data do whatever you want to transform the data return data headers are custom headers to be sent headers x requested with xmlhttprequest params are the url parameters to be sent with the request must be a plain object or a urlsearchparams object params id 12345 paramsserializer is an optional function in charge of serializing params e g https www npmjs com package qs http api jquery com jquery param paramsserializer function params return qs stringify params arrayformat brackets data is the data to be sent as the request body only applicable for request methods put post and patch when no transformrequest is set must be of one of the following types string plain object arraybuffer arraybufferview urlsearchparams browser only formdata file blob node only stream buffer data firstname fred timeout specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out if the request takes longer than timeout the request will be aborted timeout 1000 withcredentials indicates whether or not cross site access control requests should be made using credentials withcredentials false default adapter allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier return a promise and supply a valid response see lib adapters readme md adapter function config auth indicates that http basic auth should be used and supplies credentials this will set an authorization header overwriting any existing authorization custom headers you have set using headers auth username janedoe password s00pers3cret responsetype indicates the type of data that the server will respond with options are arraybuffer blob document json text stream responsetype json default responseencoding indicates encoding to use for decoding responses note ignored for responsetype of stream or client side requests responseencoding utf8 default xsrfcookiename is the name of the cookie to use as a value for xsrf token xsrfcookiename xsrf token default xsrfheadername is the name of the http header that carries the xsrf token value xsrfheadername x xsrf token default onuploadprogress allows handling of progress events for uploads onuploadprogress function progressevent do whatever you want with the native progress event ondownloadprogress allows handling of progress events for downloads ondownloadprogress function progressevent do whatever you want with the native progress event maxcontentlength defines the max size of the http response content in bytes allowed maxcontentlength 2000 validatestatus defines whether to resolve or reject the promise for a given http response status code if validatestatus returns true or is set to null or undefined the promise will be resolved otherwise the promise will be rejected validatestatus function status return status 200 status 300 default maxredirects defines the maximum number of redirects to follow in node js if set to 0 no redirects will be followed maxredirects 5 default socketpath defines a unix socket to be used in node js e g var run docker sock to send requests to the docker daemon only either socketpath or proxy can be specified if both are specified socketpath is used socketpath null default httpagent and httpsagent define a custom agent to be used when performing http and https requests respectively in node js this allows options to be added like keepalive that are not enabled by default httpagent new http agent keepalive true httpsagent new https agent keepalive true proxy defines the hostname and port of the proxy server use false to disable proxies ignoring environment variables auth indicates that http basic auth should be used to connect to the proxy and supplies credentials this will set an proxy authorization header overwriting any existing proxy authorization custom headers you have set using headers proxy host 127 0 0 1 port 9000 auth username mikeymike password rapunz3l canceltoken specifies a cancel token that can be used to cancel the request see cancellation section below for details canceltoken new canceltoken function cancel response schema the response for a request contains the following information js data is the response that was provided by the server data status is the http status code from the server response status 200 statustext is the http status message from the server response statustext ok headers the headers that the server responded with all header names are lower cased headers config is the config that was provided to axios for the request config request is the request that generated this response it is the last clientrequest instance in node js in redirects and an xmlhttprequest instance the browser request when using then you will receive the response as follows js axios get user 12345 then function response console log response data console log response status console log response statustext console log response headers console log response config when using catch or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then the response will be available through the error object as explained in the handling errors section config defaults you can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request global axios defaults js axios defaults baseurl https api example com axios defaults headers common authorization auth token axios defaults headers post content type application x www form urlencoded custom instance defaults js set config defaults when creating the instance const instance axios create baseurl https api example com alter defaults after instance has been created instance defaults headers common authorization auth token config order of precedence config will be merged with an order of precedence the order is library defaults found in lib defaults js then defaults property of the instance and finally config argument for the request the latter will take precedence over the former heres an example js create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library at this point the timeout config value is0 as is the default for the library const instance axios create override timeout default for the library now all requests using this instance will wait 2 5 seconds before timing out instance defaults timeout 2500 override timeout for this request as its known to take a long time instance get longrequest timeout 5000 interceptors you can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch js add a request interceptor axios interceptors request use function config do something before request is sent return config function error do something with request error return promise reject error add a response interceptor axios interceptors response use function response do something with response data return response function error do something with response error return promise reject error if you may need to remove an interceptor later you can js const myinterceptor axios interceptors request use function axios interceptors request eject myinterceptor you can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios js const instance axios create instance interceptors request use function handling errors js axios get user 12345 catch function error if error response the request was made and the server responded with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx console log error response data console log error response status console log error response headers else if error request the request was made but no response was received error request is an instance of xmlhttprequest in the browser and an instance of http clientrequest in node js console log error request else something happened in setting up the request that triggered an error console log error error message console log error config you can define a custom http status code error range using the validatestatus config option js axios get user 12345 validatestatus function status return status 500 reject only if the status code is greater than or equal to 500 cancellation you can cancel a request using a cancel token the axios cancel token api is based on the withdrawn cancelable promises proposal you can create a cancel token using the canceltoken source factory as shown below js const canceltoken axios canceltoken const source canceltoken source axios get user 12345 canceltoken source token catch function thrown if axios iscancel thrown console log request canceled thrown message else handle error axios post user 12345 name new name canceltoken source token cancel the request the message parameter is optional source cancel operation canceled by the user you can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the canceltoken constructor js const canceltoken axios canceltoken let cancel axios get user 12345 canceltoken new canceltoken function executor c an executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter cancel c cancel the request cancel note you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token using application x www form urlencoded format by default axios serializes javascript objects to json to send data in the application x www form urlencoded format instead you can use one of the following options browser in a browser you can use the urlsearchparams api as follows js const params new urlsearchparams params append param1 value1 params append param2 value2 axios post foo params note that urlsearchparams is not supported by all browsers see caniuse com but there is a polyfill available make sure to polyfill the global environment alternatively you can encode data using the qs library js const qs require qs axios post foo qs stringify bar 123 or in another way es6 js import qs from qs const data bar 123 const options method post headers content type application x www form urlencoded data qs stringify data url axios options node js in node js you can use the querystring module as follows js const querystring require querystring axios post http something com querystring stringify foo bar you can also use the qs library semver until axios reaches a 1 0 release breaking changes will be released with a new minor version for example 0 5 1 and 0 5 4 will have the same api but 0 6 0 will have breaking changes promises axios depends on a native es6 promise implementation to be supported if your environment doesnt support es6 promises you can polyfill typescript axios includes typescript definitions typescript import axios from axios axios get user id 12345 resources changelog upgrade guide ecosystem contributing guide code of conduct credits axios is heavily inspired by the http service provided in angular ultimately axios is an effort to provide a standalone http like service for
