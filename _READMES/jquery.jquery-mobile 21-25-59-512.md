jquery mobile jquery mobile is a unified html5 based user interface system for all popular mobile device platforms built on the rock solid jquery and jquery ui foundation its lightweight code is built with progressive enhancement and has a flexible easily themeable design jquery mobile 1 4 x works with versions of jquery core from 1 8 3 to 1 11 1 2 1 1 you can find more information about how the library works and what it is capable of by reading the documentation and exploring the demos alternatively more information can also be found on the jquerymobile site contributing you can contribute to the project by reporting issues suggesting new features or submitting pull requests please read our contributing guidelines before submitting build customization currently the library is shipped on the jquery cdn download as a single monolithic javascript file that depends on jquery core not included and a similarly bundled css file for users we support the following build targets js resolve dependencies build concat and minify the javascript used for jquery mobile css resolve dependencies build concat and minify all the css just the structure css and just the theme css demos build the js and css and make the docs ready for static consumption lint validates javascript files using jshint download builder the easiest way to obtain a custom build is to use the download builder with it you can select the parts of the library you need and both the css and javascript dependencies will be resolved for you as a packaged minified whole requirements node js grunt cli commands with node and grunt installed you can run the default target by simply issuing the following from the project root npm install grunt javascript as of version 1 1 the library uses dependency management in the javascript build by providing amd modules which can be added or removed from the core mobile meta module js jquery mobile js for example if a user wished to exclude the form widgets to reduce the wire weight of their jquery mobile include they would first remove them from the meta module diff diff git a js jquery mobile js b js jquery mobile js index 6200fe6 3a4625c 100644 a js jquery mobile js b

grunt build js css to create a new theme copy the default folder from css themes to a new folder named after your new theme eg my theme add customizations to the jquery mobile theme css file from the project root run the following grunt command theme my theme grunt build css the output will be available in the project root dist again this assumes the theme css files are available in the css themes theme directory relative to the project root css themes my theme in the example development the root of the repository is also the root of the documentation and along with the test suite acts as the test bed for bug fixes and features youll need to set up a server and get the test suite running before you can contribute patches server most of the documentation and testing pages rely on php 5 and as a result apache and php are required for development you can install them using one of the following methods one click mamp for osx xamp for osx windows existing web server eg sites directory on osx virtual machine if vagrant is installed you can add this remote branch and vagrant up in addition to vanilla apache the following modules are required rewrite mod rewrite so expire mod expires so header mod headers so once you have your web server setup you can point it at the project directory testing automated testing forms the backbone of the jquery mobile projects qa activities as a contributor or patch submitter you will be expected to run the test suite for the code your patches affect our continuous integration server will address the remainder of the test suite you can run all the test suites by running the following command grunt test you can choose to run only a subset of the tests by adding the suites option like grunt test suites table slider will only run the tests under tests unit table and tests unit slider you can also exclude some tests by using for instance grunt test type integration suites \ navigation will run all the integration tests but the navigation suite you can also specify which versions of jquery you want to test jquery mobile by using the jqueries option grunt test jqueries 1 11 1 git additionally jquery mobiles test suite is split between integration and unit tests where the unit tests are meant to focus on a single piece of the library eg a widget and the integration tests require multiple pieces of the library to function you can target either type by including the types option when testing grunt test types unit grunt test types integration grunt test types unit integration default equivalent to grunt test
