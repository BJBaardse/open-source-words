machine learning algorithms a collection of minimal and clean implementations of machine learning algorithms why this project is targeting people who want to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch the code is much easier to follow than the optimized libraries and easier to play with all algorithms are implemented in python using numpy scipy and autograd implemented deep learning mlp cnn rnn lstm linear regression logistic regression random forests support vector machine svm with kernels linear poly rbf k means gaussian mixture model k nearest neighbors naive bayes principal component analysis pca factorization machines restricted boltzmann machine rbm t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne gradient boosting trees also known as gbdt gbrt gbm xgboost reinforcement learning deep q learning installation git clone https github com rushter mlalgorithms cd mlalgorithms pip install scipy numpy pip install how to run examples without installation cd mlalgorithms python m examples linear models how to run examples within docker cd mlalgorithms docker build t mlalgorithms docker run rm it mlalgorithms bash python m examples linear models contributing your contributions are always welcome feel free to improve existing code documentation or implement new algorithm please open an issue to propose your changes if they are big enough
