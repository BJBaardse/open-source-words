nodemon nodemon is a tool that helps develop node js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node to use nodemon replace the word node on the command line when executing your script installation either through cloning with git or by using npm the recommended way bash npm install g nodemon and nodemon will be installed globally to your system path you can also install nodemon as a development dependency bash npm install save dev nodemon with a local installation nodemon will not be available in your system path instead the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script such as npm start or using npx nodemon usage nodemon wraps your application so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app bash nodemon your node app for cli options use the h or help argument bash nodemon h using nodemon is simple if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments i would start it as so bash nodemon server js localhost 8080 any output from this script is prefixed with nodemon otherwise all output from your application errors included will be echoed out as expected if no script is given nodemon will test for a package json file and if found will run the file associated with the main property ref you can also pass the inspect flag to node through the command line as you would normally bash nodemon inspect server js 80 if you have a package json file for your app you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the package json for the main property and use that value as the app nodemon will also search for the scripts start property in package json as of nodemon 1 1 x also check out the faq or issues for nodemon automatic re running nodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers but now supports apps that cleanly exit if your script exits cleanly nodemon will continue to monitor the directory or directories and restart the script if there are any changes manual restarting whilst nodemon is running if you need to manually restart your application instead of stopping and restart nodemon you can type rs with a carriage return and nodemon will restart your process config files nodemon supports local and global configuration files these are usually named nodemon json and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory an alternative local configuration file can be specified with the config file option the specificity is as follows so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings command line arguments local config global config a config file can take any of the command line arguments as json key values for example json verbose true ignore test js fixtures execmap rb ruby pde processing sketch pwd run the above nodemon json file might be my global config so that i have support for ruby files and processing files and i can run nodemon demo pde and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts a further example of options can be seen in sample nodemon md package json if you want to keep all your package configurations in one place nodemon supports using package json for configuration specify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under nodemonconfig in the package json file for example take the following package json json name nodemon homepage http nodemon io other standard package json values nodemonconfig ignore test docs delay 2500 note that if you specify a config file or provide a local nodemon json any package json config is ignored this section needs better documentation but for now you can also see nodemon help config also here using nodemon as a module please see doc requireable md using nodemon as child process please see doc events md running non node scripts nodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of js if theres no nodemon json bash nodemon exec python v app py now nodemon will run app py with python in verbose mode note that if youre not passing args to the exec program you dont need the quotes and look for new or modified files with the py extension default executables using the nodemon json config file you can define your own default executables using the execmap property this is particularly useful if youre working with a language that isnt supported by default by nodemon to add support for nodemon to know about the pl extension for perl the nodemon json file would add json execmap pl perl now running the following nodemon will know to use perl as the executable bash nodemon script pl its generally recommended to use the global nodemon json to add your own execmap options however if theres a common default thats missing this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default by changing default js and sending a pull request monitoring multiple directories by default nodemon monitors the current working directory if you want to take control of that option use the watch option to add specific paths bash nodemon watch app watch libs app server js now nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the app or libs directory by default nodemon will traverse sub directories so theres no need in explicitly including sub directories dont use unix globbing to pass multiple directories e g watch lib it wont work you need a watch flag per directory watched specifying extension watch list by default nodemon looks for files with the js mjs coffee litcoffee and json extensions if you use the exec option and monitor app py nodemon will monitor files with the extension of py however you can specify your own list with the e or ext switch like so bash nodemon e js jade now nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory or subdirectories with the extensions js jade ignoring files by default nodemon will only restart when a js javascript file changes in some cases you will want to ignore some specific files directories or file patterns to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application this can be done via the command line bash nodemon ignore lib ignore tests or specific files can be ignored bash nodemon ignore lib app js patterns can also be ignored but be sure to quote the arguments bash nodemon ignore lib js note that by default nodemon will ignore the git node modules bower components nyc output coverage and sass cache directories and add your ignored patterns to the list if you want to indeed watch a directory like node modules you need to override the underlying default ignore rules application isnt restarting in some networked environments such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive you will need to use the legacywatch true which enables chokidars polling via the cli use either legacy watch or l for short bash nodemon l though this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find delaying restarting in some situations you may want to wait until a number of files have changed the timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second if youre uploading a number of files and its taking some number of seconds this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily to add an extra throttle or delay restarting use the delay command bash nodemon delay 10 server js for more precision milliseconds can be specified either as a float bash nodemon delay 2 5 server js or using the time specifier ms bash nodemon delay 2500ms server js the delay figure is number of seconds or milliseconds if specified to delay before restarting so nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the last file change if you are setting this value in nodemon json the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds e g the following are equivalent bash nodemon delay 2 5 delay 2500 controlling shutdown of your script nodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update if you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself the following example will listen once for the sigusr2 signal used by nodemon to restart run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control js process once sigusr2 function gracefulshutdown function process kill process pid sigusr2 note that the process kill is only called once your shutdown jobs are complete hat tip to benjie gillam for writing this technique up triggering events when nodemon state changes if you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens then you can either require nodemon or add event actions to your nodemon json file for example to trigger a notification on a mac when nodemon restarts nodemon json looks like this json events restart osascript e display notification \ app restarted\ with title \ nodemon\ a full list of available events is listed on the event states wiki note that you can bind to both states and messages pipe output to somewhere else js nodemon script stdout false important this tells nodemon not to output to console on readable function the readable event indicates that data is ready to pick up this stdout pipe fs createwritestream output txt this stderr pipe fs createwritestream err txt using nodemon in your gulp workflow check out the gulp nodemon plugin to integrate

pronunciation nodemon is it pronounced node mon no demon or node e mon like pok√©mon well ive been asked this many times before i like that ive been asked this before theres been bets as to which one it actually is the answer is simple but possibly frustrating im not saying how i pronounce it its up to you to call it as you like all answers are correct design principles less flags is better works across all platforms less features let individuals build on top of nodemon offer all cli functionality as an api contributions must have and pass tests nodemon is not perfect and cli arguments has sprawled beyond where im completely happy but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day faq see the faq and please add your own questions if you think they would help others backers thank you to all
