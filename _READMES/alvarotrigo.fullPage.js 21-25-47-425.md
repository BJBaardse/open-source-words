fullscreen scrolling websites also known as single page websites or onepage sites it allows the creation of fullscreen scrolling websites as well as adding some landscape sliders inside the sections of the site introduction compatibility license usage creating links to sections or slides creating smaller or bigger sections state classes added by fullpage js lazy loading auto play pause embedded media use extensions options methods callbacks reporting issues contributing to fullpage js changelog build tasks resources who is using fullpage js donations sponsors introduction suggestion are more than welcome not only for feature requests but also for coding style improvements lets make this a great library to make peoples lives easier compatibility fullpage js is fully functional on all modern browsers as well as some old ones such as internet explorer 9 opera 12 etc it works with browsers with css3 support and with the ones which dont have it making it ideal for old browsers compatibility it also provides touch support for mobile phones tablets and touch screen computers special thanks to browserstack for supporting fullpage js license commercial license if you want to use fullpage to develop commercial sites themes projects and applications the commercial license is the appropriate license with this option your source code is kept proprietary which means you wont have to change your whole application source code to an open source license purchase a fullpage commercial license open source license if you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the gnu gpl license v3 you may use fullpage under the terms of the gplv3 the credit comments in the javascript and css files should be kept intact even after combination or minification read more about fullpages license usage as you can see in the example files you will need to include the javascript file fullpage js or its minified version fullpage min js the css file fullpage css optionally when using css3 false you can add the easings file in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the one included in the library easeinoutcubic install using bower or npm optionally you can install fullpage js with bower or npm if you prefer terminal shell with bower bower install fullpage js with npm npm install fullpage js including files html this following line is optional only necessary if you use the option css3 false and you want to use other easing effects rather than easeinoutcubic this following line is only necessary in the case of using the option scrolloverflow true optional use of cdn if you prefer to use a cdn to load the needed files fullpage js is in cdnjs https cdnjs com libraries fullpage js required html structure start your html document with the compulsory html doctype declaration on the 1st line of your html code you might have troubles with sections heights otherwise the examples provided use html 5 doctype doctype html each section will be defined with an element containing the section class the active section by default will be the first section which is taken as the home page sections should be placed inside a wrapper div id fullpage in this case the wrapper can not be the body element html div id fullpage div class section some section div div class section some section div div class section some section div div class section some section div div if you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first html div class section active some section div in order to create a landscape slider within a section each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the slide class html div class section div class slide slide 1 div div class slide slide 2 div div class slide slide 3 div div class slide slide 4 div div you can see a fully working example of the html structure in the demopage html file https github com alvarotrigo fullpage js blob master examples demopage html initialization initialization with vanilla javascript all you need to do is call fullpage js before the closing body tag javascript new fullpage fullpage options here autoscrolling true scrollhorizontally true methods fullpage api setallowscrolling false initialization with jquery

function section origin destination direction creating links to sections or slides if you are using fullpage js with anchor links for the sections using the anchors option or the attribute data anchor in each section then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section this would be an example of a link with an anchor http alvarotrigo com fullpage secondpage 2 which is the url you will see once you access to that section slide manually notice the last part of the url ends in secondpage 2 having the following initialization javascript new fullpage fullpage anchors firstpage secondpage thirdpage the anchor at the end of the url secondpage 2 defines the section and slide of destination respectively in the previous url the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondpage and the slide will be the 2nd slide as we are using the index 2 for it the fist slide of a section has index 0 as technically it is a section we could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute data anchor on the html markup like so html div class section div class slide data anchor slide1 slide 1 div div class slide data anchor slide2 slide 2 div div class slide data anchor slide3 slide 3 div div class slide data anchor slide4 slide 4 div div in this last case the url we would use would be secondpage slide3 which is the equivalent to our previous secondpage 2 note that section anchors can also be defined in the same way by using the data anchor attribute if no anchors array is provided be careful data anchor tags can not have the same value as any id element on the site or name element for ie creating smaller or bigger sections demo fullpage js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides it is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport this is ideal for footers it is important to realise that it doesnt make sense to have all of your sections using this feature if there is more than one section in the initial load of the site fullpage js wont scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport to create smaller sections just use the class fp auto height in the section you want to apply it it will then take the height defined by your section slide content html div class section whole viewport div div class section fp auto height auto height div responsive auto height sections demo a responsive auto height can be applied by using the class fp auto height responsive this way sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired then theyll take the size required by their content which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport state classes added by fullpage js fullpage js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site active is added the current visible section and slide active is added to the current menu element if using the menu option a class of the form fp viewing section slide is added to the body element of the site eg fp viewing secondpage 0 the section and slide parts will be the anchors or indexes if no anchor is provided of the current section and slide fp responsive is added to the body element when the entering in the responsive mode fp enabled is added to the html element when fullpage js is enabled and removed when destroyed fp destroyed is added to the fullpage js container when fullpage js is destroyed lazy loading demo fullpage js provides a way to lazy load images videos and audio elements so they wont slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer when using lazy loading all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport to enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attribute to data src as shown below img data src image png video source data src video webm type video webm source data src video mp4 type video mp4 video if you already use another lazy load solution which uses data src as well you can disable the fullpage js lazy loading by setting the option lazyloading false auto play pause embedded media note the autoplay feature might not work on some mobile devices depending on the os and browser i e safari on ios version 10 0 play on section slide load using the attribute autoplay for videos or audio or the param autoplay 1 for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load in order to play it on section slide load use instead the attribute data autoplay for example html audio data autoplay source src http metakoncept hr horse ogg type audio ogg audio pause on leave embedded html5 video audio and youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide this can be disabled by using the attribute data keepplaying for example html audio data keepplaying source src http metakoncept hr horse ogg type audio ogg audio use extensions fullpage js provides a set of extensions you can use to enhance its default features all of them are listed as fullpage js options extensions requires you to use the minified file fullpage extensions min js that is inside the dist folder instead of the usual fullpage js file fullpage js or fullpage min js once you adquire the extension file you will need to add it before fullpage for example if i want to use the continuous horizontal extension i would have include the extension file and then the extensions version of the fullpage file html script type text javascript src fullpage continuoushorizontal min js script script type text javascript src fullpage fullpage extensions min js script an activation key and a license key will be required for each extension see more details about it here then you will be able to use and configure them as explained in options options licensekey default null this option is compulsory if you use fullpage in a non open source project then you should use the license key provided on the purchase of the fullpage commercial license otherwise you can use the string open source gplv3 license please read more about licenses here and on the website v2compatible default false determines whether to make it 100 compatible with any code written for version 2 ignoring new features or api changes of version 3 state classes callbacks signature etc will work exactly in the same way as it did on verion 2 note that this option will be removed at some point in the future controlarrows default true determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left verticalcentered default true vertically centering of the content within sections when set to true your content will be wrapped by the library consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterrender callback scrollingspeed default 700 speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions sectionscolor default none define the css background color property for each section example javascript new fullpage fullpage sectionscolor f2f2f2 4bbfc3 7baabe whitesmoke 000 anchors default defines the anchor links example to be shown on the url for each section anchors value should be unique the position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied second position for second section and so on using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser this option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide be careful anchors can not have the same value as any id element on the site or name element for ie now anchors can be defined directly in the html structure by using the attribute data anchor as explained here lockanchors default false determines whether anchors in the url will have any effect at all in the library you can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks but they wont have any effect in the scrolling of the site useful if you want to combine fullpage js with other plugins using anchor in the url important it is helpful to understand that the values in the anchors option array correlate directly to the element with the class of section by its position in the markup easing default easeinoutcubic defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling it requires the file vendors easings min js or jquery ui for using some of its transitions other libraries could be used instead easingcss3 default ease defines the transition effect to use in case of using css3 true you can use the pre defined ones such as linear ease out or create your own ones using the cubic bezier function you might want to use matthew lein css easing animation tool for it looptop default false defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not loopbottom default false defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not loophorizontal default true defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not css3 default true defines whether to use javascript or css3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting css3 if this option is set to true and the browser doesnt support css3 a fallback will be used instead autoscrolling default true defines whether to use the automatic scrolling or the normal one it also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser device window in tablets and mobile phones fittosection default true determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not when set to true the current active section will always fill the whole viewport otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section fittosectiondelay default 1000 if fittosection is set to true this delays the fitting by the configured milliseconds scrollbar default false determines whether to use scrollbar for the site or not in case of using scroll bar the autoscrolling functionality will still work as expected the user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullpage js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes paddingtop default 0 defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure paddingtop 10px paddingtop 10em useful in case of using a fixed header paddingbottom default 0 defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure paddingbottom 10px paddingbottom 10em useful in case of using a fixed footer fixedelements default null defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the css3 option to keep them fixed it requires a string with the javascript selectors for those elements for example fixedelements element1 element2 normalscrollelements default null if you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements this is the option you need to use useful for maps scrolling divs etc it requires a string with the javascript selectors for those elements for example normalscrollelements element1 element2 this option should not be applied to any section slide element itself normalscrollelementtouchthreshold default 5 defines the threshold for the number of hops up the html node tree fullpage will test to see if normalscrollelements is a match to allow scrolling functionality on divs on a touch device for example normalscrollelementtouchthreshold 3 bigsectionsdestination default null defines how to scroll to a section which size is bigger than the viewport by default fullpage js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one possible values are top bottom null keyboardscrolling default true defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard touchsensitivity default 5 defines a percentage of the browsers window width height and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section slide continuousvertical default false defines whether scrolling down in the last section or should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one not compatible with looptop loopbottom or any scroll bar present in the site scrollbar true or autoscrolling false continuoushorizontal default false extension of fullpage js defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not not compatible with loophorizontal requires fullpage js 2 8 3 scrollhorizontally default false extension of fullpage js defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad it can only be used when using autoscrolling true ideal for story telling requires fullpage js 2 8 3 interlockedslides default false extension of fullpage js determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction possible values are true false or an array with the interlocked sections for example 1 3 5 starting by 1 requires fullpage js 2 8 3 dragandmove default false extension of fullpage js enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers requires fullpage js 2 8 9 possible values are true enables the feature false disables the feature vertical enables the feature only vertically horizontal enables the feature only horizontally fingersonly enables the feature for touch devices only mouseonly enables the feature for desktop devices only mouse and trackpad offsetsections default false extension of fullpage js provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage ideal to show visitors theres more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section requires fullpage js 2 8 8 to define the percentage of each section the attribute data percentage must be used the centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attribute data centered default to true if not specified for example html div class section data percentage 80 data centered true resetsliders default false extension of fullpage js defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section requires fullpage js 2 8 3 fadingeffect default false extension of fullpage js defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one possible values are true false sections slides it can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally or to both at the time requires fullpage js 2 8 6 animateanchor default true defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section recordhistory default true defines whether to push the state of the site to the browsers history when set to true each section slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections slides to reach the previous or next state of the site when set to false the url will keep changing but will have no effect on the browsers history this option is automatically turned off when using autoscrolling false menu default false a selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections this way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class active this wont generate a menu but will just add the active class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links in order to link the elements of the menu with the sections an html 5 data tag data menuanchor will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections example html ul id mymenu li data menuanchor firstpage class active a href firstpage first section a li li data menuanchor secondpage a href secondpage second section a li li data menuanchor thirdpage a href thirdpage third section a li li data menuanchor fourthpage a href fourthpage fourth section a li ul javascript new fullpage fullpage anchors firstpage secondpage thirdpage fourthpage lastpage menu mymenu note the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using css3 true otherwise it will be appended to the body by the plugin itself navigation default false if set to true it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles navigationposition default none it can be set to left or right and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown if using one navigationtooltips default defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used example navigationtooltips firstslide secondslide you can also define them by using the attribute data tooltip in each section if you prefer showactivetooltip default false shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation slidesnavigation default false if set to true it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site slidesnavposition default bottom defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders admits top and bottom as values you may want to modify the css styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color scrolloverflow default false defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it when set to true your content will be wrapped by the plugin consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterrender callback in case of setting it to true it requires the vendor library scrolloverflow min js this file has to be loaded before the fullpage js plugin but after jquery in case of using it for example html script type text javascript src vendors scrolloverflow min js script script type text javascript src fullpage js script in order to prevent fullpage js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the class fp noscroll for example div class section fp noscroll you can also prevent scrolloverflow from getting applied on responsive mode when using fp auto height responsive in the section element scrolloverflowreset default false extension of fullpage js when set to true it scrolls up the content of the section slide with scroll bar when leaving to another vertical section this way the section slide will always show the start of its content even when scrolling from a section under it scrolloverflowoptions when using scrolloverflow true fullpage js will make use of a forked and modified version of iscroll js library you can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage js with the iscroll js options you want to use check its documentation for more info sectionselector default section defines the javascript selector used for the plugin sections it might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage js slideselector default slide defines the javascript selector used for the plugin slides it might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage js responsivewidth default 0 a normal scroll autoscrolling false will be used under the defined width in pixels a class fp responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive css for example if set to 900 whenever the browsers width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site responsiveheight default 0 a normal scroll autoscrolling false will be used under the defined height in pixels a class fp responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive css for example if set to 900 whenever the browsers height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site responsiveslides default false extension of fullpage js when set to true slides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired by using the responsivewidth or responsiveheight options detailed above requires fullpage js 2 8 5 parallax default false extension of fullpage js defines whether or not to use the parallax backgrounds effects on sections slides read more about how to apply the parallax option parallaxoptions default type reveal percentage 62 property translate allows to configure the parameters for the parallax backgrounds effect when using the option parallax true read more about how to apply the parallax option lazyloading default true lazy loading is active by default which means it will lazy load any media element containing the attribute data src as detailed in the lazy loading docs if you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage js feature methods you can see them in action here getactivesection demo gets an object type section containing the
