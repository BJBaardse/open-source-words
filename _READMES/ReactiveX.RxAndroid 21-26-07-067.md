rxandroid reactive extensions for android android specific bindings for rxjava 2 this module adds the minimum classes to rxjava that make writing reactive components in android applications easy and hassle free more specifically it provides a scheduler that schedules on the main thread or any given looper communication since rxandroid is part of the rxjava family the communication channels are similar google group rxjava twitter rxjava stackoverflow rx android github issues binaries groovy implementation io reactivex rxjava2 rxandroid 2 0 2 because rxandroid releases are few and far between it is recommended you also explicitly depend on rxjavas latest version for bug fixes and new features see https github com reactivex rxjava releases for latest 2 x x version implementation io reactivex rxjava2 rxjava 2 x x rxandroid rxjava additional binaries and dependency information for can be found at http search maven org build to build bash git clone git github com reactivex rxandroid git cd rxandroid gradlew build further details on building can be found on the rxjava getting started page of the wiki sample usage a sample project which provides runnable code examples that demonstrate uses of the classes in this project is available in the sample app folder observing on the main thread one of the most common operations when dealing with asynchronous tasks on android is to observe the tasks result or outcome on the main thread using vanilla android this would typically be accomplished with an asynctask with rxjava instead you would declare your observable to be observed on the main thread java observable just one two three four five subscribeon schedulers newthread observeon androidschedulers mainthread subscribe an observer this will execute the observable on a new thread and emit results through onnext on the main thread observing on arbitrary loopers the previous sample is merely a specialization of a more general concept binding asynchronous communication to an android message loop or looper in order to observe an observable on an arbitrary looper create an associated scheduler by calling androidschedulers from java looper backgroundlooper observable just one two three four five observeon androidschedulers from backgroundlooper subscribe an observer this will execute the observable on a new thread and emit results through onnext on whatever thread is running backgroundlooper bugs and feedback for bugs feature requests and discussion please use github issues for general usage questions please use the mailing list or stackoverflow license copyright 2015 the rxandroid authors licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
