oriented database system ravendb a transactional open source document database rethinkdb document database that supports queries like table joins and group by key map data model note there is some term confusion in the industry and two different things are called columnar databases some listed here are distributed persistent databases built around the key map data model all data has a possibly composite key with which a map of key value pairs is associated in some systems multiple such value maps can be associated with a key and these maps are referred to as column families with value map keys being referred to as columns another group of technologies that can also be called columnar databases is distinguished by how it stores data on disk or in memory rather than storing data the traditional way where all column values for a given key are stored next to each other row by row these systems store all column values next to each other so more work is needed to get all columns for a given key but less work is needed to get all values for a given column the former group is referred to as key map data model here the line between these and the key value data model stores is fairly blurry the latter being more about the storage format than about the data model is listed under columnar databases you can read more about this distinction on prof daniel abadis blog distinguishing
