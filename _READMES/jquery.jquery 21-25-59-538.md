jquery â€” new wave javascript contribution guides in the spirit of open source software development jquery always encourages community code contribution to help you get started and before you jump into writing code be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly getting involved core style guide writing code for jquery foundation projects environments in which to use jquery browser support jquery also supports node browser extensions and other non browser environments what you need to build your own jquery in order to build jquery you need to have the latest node js npm and git 1 7 or later earlier versions might work but are not supported for windows you have to download and install git and node js os x users should install homebrew once homebrew is installed run brew install git to install git and brew install node to install node js linux bsd users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and node js or build from source if you swing that way easy peasy how to build your own jquery clone a copy of the main jquery git repo by running bash git clone git github com jquery jquery git enter the jquery directory and run the build script bash cd jquery npm run build the built version of jquery will be put in the dist subdirectory along with the minified copy and associated map file if you want to create custom build or help with jquery development it would be better to install grunt command line interface as a global package npm install g grunt cli make sure you have grunt installed by testing grunt v now by running the grunt command in the jquery directory you can build a full version of jquery just like with an npm run build command grunt there are many other tasks available for jquery core grunt help modules special builds can be created that exclude subsets of jquery functionality this allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jquery are not being used for example an app that only used jsonp for ajax and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax xhr modules any module may be excluded except for core and selector to exclude a module pass its path relative to the src folder without the js extension some example modules that can be excluded are ajax all ajax functionality ajax get post ajaxsetup load transports and ajax event shorthands such as ajaxstart ajax xhr the xmlhttprequest ajax transport only ajax script the script ajax transport only used to retrieve scripts ajax jsonp the jsonp ajax transport only depends on the ajax script transport css the css method also removes all modules depending on css including effects dimensions and offset css showhide non animated show hide and toggle can be excluded if you use classes or explicit css calls to set the display property also removes the effects module deprecated methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed dimensions the width and height methods including inner and outer variations effects the animate method and its shorthands such as slideup or hide slow event the on and off methods and all event functionality also removes event alias event alias all event attaching triggering shorthands like click or mouseover event focusin cross browser support for the focusin and focusout events event trigger the trigger and triggerhandler methods used by alias and focusin modules offset the offset position offsetparent scrollleft and scrolltop methods wrap the wrap wrapall wrapinner and unwrap methods core ready exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body any ready callbacks bound with jquery will simply be called immediately however jquery document ready will not be a function and on ready or similar will not be triggered deferred exclude jquery deferred this also removes jquery callbacks note that modules that depend on jquery deferred ajax effects core ready will not be removed and will still expect jquery deferred to be there include your own jquery deferred implementation or exclude those modules as well grunt custom deferred ajax effects core ready exports global exclude the attachment of global jquery variables and jquery to the window exports amd exclude the amd definition as a special case you may also replace sizzle by using a special flag grunt custom sizzle sizzle the sizzle selector engine when this module is excluded it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browsers queryselectorall method that does not support jquery selector extensions or enhanced semantics see the selector native js file for details note excluding sizzle will also exclude all jquery selector extensions such as effects animatedselector and css hiddenvisibleselectors the build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes or includes amd name as an option you can set the module name for jquerys amd definition by default it is set to jquery which plays nicely with plugins and third party libraries but there may be cases where youd like to change this simply set the amd option bash grunt custom amd custom name or to define anonymously set the name to an empty string bash grunt custom amd custom build examples to create a custom build first check out the version bash git pull git checkout version where version is the version you want to customize then make sure all node dependencies are installed bash npm install create the custom build using the grunt custom option listing the modules to be excluded exclude all ajax functionality bash grunt custom ajax excluding css removes modules depending on css effects offset dimensions bash grunt custom css exclude a bunch of modules bash grunt custom ajax css deprecated dimensions effects event alias offset wrap for questions or requests regarding custom builds please start a thread on the developing jquery core section of the forum due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds they are not regularly tested in jquerys unit test process the non sizzle selector engine currently does not pass unit tests because it is missing too much essential functionality running the unit tests make sure you have the necessary dependencies bash npm install start grunt watch or npm start to auto build jquery as you work bash grunt watch run the unit tests with a local server that supports php ensure that you run the site from the root directory not the test directory no database is required pre configured php local servers are available for windows and mac here are some options windows wamp download mac mamp download linux setting up lamp mongoose most platforms building to a different directory to copy the built jquery files from dist to another directory bash grunt grunt dist path to special location with this example the output files would be bash path to special location jquery js path to special location jquery min js to add a permanent copy destination create a file in dist called destination json inside the file paste and customize the following json absolute path to other destination true additionally both methods can be combined essential git as the source code is handled by the git version control system its useful to know some features used cleaning if you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream the following commands can be used remember everything youve worked on is gone after these bash git reset hard upstream master git clean fdx rebasing for feature topic branches you should always use the rebase flag to git pull or if you are usually handling many temporary to be in a github pull request branches run the following to automate this bash git config branch autosetuprebase local see man git config for more information handling merge conflicts if youre getting merge conflicts when merging instead of editing the conflicted files manually you can use the feature git mergetool even though the default tool xxdiff looks awful old its rather useful the following are some commands that can be used there ctrl alt m automerge as much as possible b jump to next merge conflict s change the order of the conflicted lines u undo a merge left mouse button mark a block to be the winner middle mouse button mark a line to be the winner ctrl s save ctrl q quit qunit reference test methods js expect numassertions stop start note qunits eventual addition of an argument to stop start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters test assertions js ok value message equal actual expected message notequal actual expected message deepequal actual expected message notdeepequal actual expected message strictequal actual

in a separate iframe the actual test code and assertions remain in jquerys main test files only the minimal test fixture markup and setup code should be placed in the iframe file js testiframe testname filename function testcallback assert jquery window document additional args this loads a page constructing a url with filename data filename the iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by including the test data iframetest js script and calling startiframetest additional args when appropriate often this will be after either document ready or window onload fires the testcallback receives the qunit assert object created by testiframe for this test followed by the global jquery window and document from the iframe if the iframe code passes any arguments to startiframetest they follow the document argument questions if you have any questions please feel free to ask on the developing jquery core forum or in jquery on irc freenode net
