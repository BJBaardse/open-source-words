vue cli a simple cli for scaffolding vue js projects installation prerequisites node js 6 x 8 x preferred npm version 3 and git bash npm install g vue cli usage bash vue init template name project name example bash vue init webpack my project the above command pulls the template from vuejs templates webpack prompts for some information and generates the project at my project vue build use vue cli as a zero configuration development tool for your vue apps and component check out the docs official templates the purpose of official vue project templates are to provide opinionated battery included development tooling setups so that users can get started with actual app code as fast as possible however these templates are un opinionated in terms of how you structure your app code and what libraries you use in addition to vue js all official project templates are repos in the vuejs templates organization when a new template is added to the organization you will be able to run vue init template name project name to use that template you can also run vue list to see all available official templates current available templates include webpack a full featured webpack vue loader setup with hot reload linting testing css extraction webpack simple a simple webpack vue loader setup for quick prototyping browserify a full featured browserify vueify setup with hot reload linting unit testing browserify simple a simple browserify vueify setup for quick prototyping pwa pwa template for vue cli based on the webpack template simple the simplest possible vue setup in a single html file custom templates its unlikely to make everyone happy with the official templates you can simply fork an official template and then use it via vue cli with bash vue init username repo my project where username repo is the github repo shorthand for your fork the shorthand repo notation is passed to download git repo so you can also use things like bitbucket username repo for a bitbucket repo and username repo branch for tags or branches if you would like to download from a private repository use the clone flag and the cli will use git clone so your ssh keys are used local templates instead of a github repo you can also use a template on your local file system bash vue init fs path to custom template my project writing custom templates from scratch a template repo must have a template directory that holds the template files a template repo may have a metadata file for the template which can be either a meta js or meta json file it can contain the following fields prompts used to collect user options data filters used to conditional filter files to render metalsmith used to add custom metalsmith plugins in the chain completemessage the message to be displayed to the user when the template has been generated you can include custom instruction here complete instead of using completemessage you can use a function to run stuffs when the template has been generated prompts the prompts field in the metadata file should be an object hash containing prompts for the user for each entry the key is the variable name and the value is an inquirer js question object example json prompts name type string required true message project name after all prompts are finished all files inside template will be rendered using handlebars with the prompt results as the data conditional prompts a prompt can be made conditional by adding a when field which should be a javascript expression evaluated with data collected from previous prompts for example json prompts lint type confirm message use a linter lintconfig when lint type list message pick a lint config choices standard airbnb none the prompt for lintconfig will only be triggered when the user answered yes to the lint prompt pre registered handlebars helpers two commonly used handlebars helpers if eq and unless eq are pre registered handlebars if eq lintconfig airbnb if eq custom handlebars helpers you may want to register additional handlebars helpers using the helpers property in the metadata file the object key is the helper name js module exports helpers lowercase str str tolowercase upon registration they can be used as follows handlebars lowercase name file filters the filters field in the metadata file should be an object hash containing file filtering rules for each entry the key is a minimatch glob pattern and the value is a javascript expression evaluated in the context of prompt answers data example json filters test needtests files under test will only be generated if the user answered yes to the prompt for needtests note that the dot option for minimatch is set to true so glob patterns would also match dotfiles by default skip rendering the skipinterpolation field in the metadata file should be a minimatch glob pattern the files matched should skip rendering example json skipinterpolation src vue metalsmith vue cli uses metalsmith to generate the project you may customize the metalsmith builder created by vue cli to register custom plugins js metalsmith function metalsmith opts helpers function custommetalsmithplugin files metalsmith done implement something really custom here done null files metalsmith use custommetalsmithplugin if you need to hook metalsmith before questions are asked you may use an object with before key js metalsmith before function metalsmith opts helpers after function metalsmith opts helpers additional data available in meta js json destdirname destination directory name json completemessage to get started \n\n cd destdirname \n npm install\n npm run dev inplace generating template into current directory json completemessage inplace to get started \n\n npm install\n npm run dev else to get started \n\n cd destdirname \n npm install\n npm run dev inplace complete function arguments data the same data you can access in completemessage js complete data if data inplace console log cd data destdirname helpers some helpers you can use to log results chalk the chalk module logger the built in vue cli logger files an array of generated files js complete data logger chalk if data inplace logger log cd chalk yellow data destdirname installing a specific template version vue cli uses the tool download git repo to download the official templates used the download git repo tool allows you to indicate a specific branch for a given repository by providing the desired branch name after a pound sign the format needed for a specific official template is vue init template name branch name project name example installing the 1 0 branch of the webpack simple vue template vue init webpack simple 1 0 mynewproject note the surrounding quotes are necessary on zsh shells because of the special meaning of the character
