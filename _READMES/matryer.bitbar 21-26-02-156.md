and choose refresh from one of the bitbar menus configure the refresh time the refresh time is in the filename of the plugin following this format name time ext name the name of the file time the refresh rate see below ext the file extension for example date 1m sh would refresh every minute most plugins will come with a default but you can change it to anything you like 10s ten seconds 1m one minute 2h two hours 1d a day ensure you have execution rights ensure the plugin is executable by running chmod x plugin sh using symlinks because git will ignore everything in plugins enabled you can use it to maintain your own plugins directory while still benefitting from tracking upstream changes example cd plugins enabled enable spotify plugin ln s music spotify 10s sh enable uptime plugin and change update interval to 30 seconds ln s system uptime 1m sh uptime 30s sh then select the enabled folder in your bitbar preferences resetting plugin directory in case you made the mistake of choosing a directory with thousands of files as the plugin directory and bitbar getting stuck forever do this from terminal to reset it defaults delete com matryer bitbar contributing help us solve

be sure to include appropriate metadata to enhance the plugins entry on getbitbar com plugin api to write a plugin just write some form of executable script that outputs to the standard output multiple lines will be cycled through over and over if your output contains a line consisting only of the lines below it will appear in the dropdown for that plugin but wont appear in the menu bar itself lines beginning with will appear in submenus use etc for nested submenus two dashes per level of nesting your lines might contain to separate the title from other parameters such as href to make the item clickable color to change their text color eg color red or color ff0000 font to change their text font eg font ubuntumono bold size to change their text size eg size 12 bash to make the item run a given script terminal with your script e g bash users user bitbar plugins scripts nginx restart sh if there are spaces in the file path you will need quotes e g bash users user bitbar plugins scripts nginx restart sh param1 to specify arguments to the script additional params like this param2 foo param3 bar full example bash users user bitbar plugins scripts nginx restart sh param1 verbose assuming that nginx restart sh is executable or bash usr bin ruby param1 users user rubyscript rb param2 arg1 param3 arg2 if script is not executable terminal start bash script without opening terminal true or false refresh to make the item refresh the plugin it belongs to if the item runs a script refresh is performed after the script finishes eg refresh true dropdown may be set to true or false if false the line will only appear and cycle in the status bar but not in the dropdown length to truncate the line to the specified number of characters a â€¦ will be added to any truncated strings as well as a tooltip displaying the full string eg length 10 trim whether to trim leading trailing whitespace from the title true or false defaults to true alternate true to mark a line as an alternate to the previous one for when the option key is pressed in the dropdown templateimage set an image for this item the image data must be passed as base64 encoded string and should consist of only black and clear pixels the alpha channel in the image can be used to adjust the opacity of black content however this is the recommended way to set an image for the statusbar use a 144 dpi resolution to support retina displays the imageformat can be any of the formats supported by mac os x image set an image for this item the image data must be passed as base64 encoded string use a 144 dpi resolution to support retina displays the imageformat can be any of the formats supported by mac os x emojize false will disable parsing of github style mushroom into mushroom ansi false turns off parsing of ansi codes metadata to enhance your entry on getbitbar com add the following metadata to your source code usually in comments somewhere title goes here v1 0 your name your github username short description of what your plugin does http www hosted somewhere pluginimage python ruby node http url to about com the comment characters can be anything use what is suitable for your language bitbar title the title of the plugin bitbar version the version of the plugin start with v1 0 bitbar author your name bitbar author github your github username without bitbar desc a short description of what your plugin does bitbar image a hosted image showing a preview of your plugin ideally open bitbar dependencies comma separated list of dependencies bitbar abouturl absolute url to about information for a real example see the cycle text and detail plugin source code useful tips if youre writing scripts ensure it has a shebang at the top you can add to path by including something like export path usr local bin usr bin path in your plugin script you can use emoji in the output find an example in the music vox plugin if your bash script generates text in another language set the lang variable with export lang es es utf 8 for spanish to show the text in correct format if you want to call the plugin script for action you can use bash 0 if your plugin should support retina displays export your icon at 36x36 with a resolution of 144 dpi see this issue for a more thorough explanation examples one line plugin bin bash date multi line plugin bin bash the current date and time date
