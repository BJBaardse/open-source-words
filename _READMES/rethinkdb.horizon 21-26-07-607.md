rethinkdb fusion rethinkdb fusion is an open source developer platform for building realtime scalable web apps it is built on top of rethinkdb and allows app developers to get started with building modern engaging apps without writing any backend code note fusion is a codename that well likely change in the future see https github com rethinkdb fusion issues 7 fusion consists of two components fusion server a middleware server that connects to is built on top of rethinkdb and exposes a simple api protocol to front end applications fusion client library a javascript client library that wraps fusion servers protocol in a convenient api for front end developers the first version of fusion will expose the following services to developers sync a streaming api for building realtime apps directly from the browser without writing any backend code auth an authentication api that connects to common auth providers e g facebook google github identity an api for listing and manipulating user accounts permissions a security model that allows the developer to protect the data from unauthorized access geolocation an api that makes it very easy to build location aware apps session management manage browser session and session information presence an api for detecting presence information for a given user and sharing it with others upcoming versions of fusion will likely expose the following additional services plugins a system for extending fusion with user defined services in a consistent discoverable way backend an api protocol to integrate custom backend code with fusion server client libraries why fusion while rethinkdb is poised to be an excellent database for building realtime apps empirically there is still too much friction for most developers to get started they have to learn reql understand changefeeds and figure out how to thread changefeeds through their backend code the learning curve is quite steep and most of the initial work involves boilerplate code thats pretty far removed from the primary task of building a realtime app fusion sets out to solve this problem developers can start building apps using their favorite front end framework using fusions apis without having to write any backend code since fusion stores data in rethinkdb once the app gets sufficiently complex to need custom business logic on the backend developers can incrementally add backend code at any time in the development cycle of their app faq how do you start fusion this is still being designed but roughly it will look like this start rethinkdb rethinkdb in another terminal start fusion fusion rethinkdb host localhost rethinkdb port 28015 clients can connect directly from the browser on port 8181 what does the code look like the api is still in development but roughly here is what youd write on the front end for a todo list application js connect to fusion this fusion new fusion localhost 8181 when a user adds a todo item onadditem function e this fusion todo items insert item this state text listen to updates from other users init function this fusion todo items on added function item add the item to the data model on removed function item remove the item from the data model how is fusion different from firebase there are a few major differences fusion is open source you can run it on your laptop deploy it to the cloud or deploy it to any infrastructure you want fusion will allow you to build complex enterprise apps not just basic applications with limited functionality since fusion stores data in rethinkdb once your app grows beyond the basic fusion api you can start adding backend code of arbitrary complexity that has complete access to a fully featured database since fusion is build on rethinkdb well be able to expose services that are much more sophisticated than simple document sync e g realtime analytics streams on joined tables etc how is fusion different from meteor fusion has philosophical and technical differences with meteor that will result in vastly different developer experiences fusion is a small layer on top of rethinkdb with a narrow purpose built api designed to make it very easy to get started building realtime apps without backend code fusion isnt prescriptive you can use any front end framework without any magic customizations and once your app outgrows the fusion api you can use any backend technology e g node js python ruby and any backend framework e g rails express koa etc by contrast meteor is a much more prescriptive framework fusion is a reasonably small component that has a very clean separation with the database and the frontend while meteor is a much more monolithic experience another major difference is architectural meteor uses a livequery component built by tailing mongodbs oplog this approach is fundamentally limited its impossible to do many operations efficiently and even the basic functionality is extremely difficult to scale fusion is built on rethinkdb so the livequery functionality is in the database this allows for much more sophisticated streaming operations e g feeds on joins and aggregations once rethinkdb supports them and scalability is dramatically simpler because the database has all the necessary information to allow for a scalable feeds implementation how will fusion be licensed we still have to figure out the exact license but fusion will be fully open source well probably use mit or apache
