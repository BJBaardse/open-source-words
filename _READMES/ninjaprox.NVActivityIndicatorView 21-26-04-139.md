nvactivityindicatorview introduction nvactivityindicatorview is a collection of awesome loading animations this is original a fork from dgactivityindicatorview inspired by loaders css written in swift with full implementation of animations plus more you can also find objective c version of this here demo for first hand experience just open the project and run it animation types type type type type

installation cocoapods install cocoapods if need be bash gem install cocoapods add nvactivityindicatorview in your podfile ruby use frameworks pod nvactivityindicatorview then run the following command bash pod install carthage install carthage if need be bash brew update brew install carthage add nvactivityindicatorview in your cartfile ruby github ninjaprox nvactivityindicatorview run carthage to build the framework and drag the built nvactivityindicatorview framework into your xcode project note you might encounter compile issue if so please use carthage branch instead check issue 101 for more information manual copy nvactivityindicatorview folder to your project thats it note make sure that all files in nvactivityindicatorview included in compile sources in build phases note if you encounter issues while uploading the app to itunes connect remove the info plist file in nvactivityindicatorview check issue 129 for more information migration version 4 0 0 this version requires xcode 9 0 and swift 4 version 3 7 0 this version splits nvactivityindicatorview pod to 2 subpods nvactivityindicatorview presenter and nvactivityindicatorview appextension there is no need to change pod nvactivityindicatorview to pod nvactivityindicatorview presenter since it will be installed by default if you use the main pod name however if you want to use nvactivityindicatorview in app extension use pod nvactivityindicatorview appextension instead note related issue 119 version 3 6 0 this version requires xcode 8 3 and swift 3 1 version 3 0 this version requires xcode 8 0 and swift 3 nvactivityindicatorview startanimation and nvactivityindicatorview stopanimation are deleted use nvactivityindicatorview startanimating and nvactivityindicatorview stopanimating instead uiviewcontroller startactivityanimating and uiviewcontroller stopactivityanimating are deleted use uiviewcontroller startanimating and uiviewcontroller stopanimating instead version 2 0 this version continues to spport xcode 7 0 and swift 2 2 and earlier for swift 2 3 support use swift2 3 branch instead ruby pod nvactivityindicatorview git https github com ninjaprox nvactivityindicatorview git branch swift2 3 usage firstly import nvactivityindicatorview swift import nvactivityindicatorview initialization then there are two ways you can create nvactivityindicatorview by storyboard changing class of any uiview to nvactivityindicatorview note set module to nvactivityindicatorview by code using initializer all parameters other than frame are optional and nvactivityindicatorview default are used as default values swift nvactivityindicatorview frame frame type type color color padding padding control start animating swift activityindicatorview startanimating stop animating swift activityindicatorview stopanimating determine if it is animating swift animating activityindicatorview isanimating change properties in storyboard you can change all properties in attributes inspector tab of utilities panel note use one of values case insensitive in animation types for type name all properties are public so you can change them after initializing note all changes must be made before calling startanimating ui blocker by conforming nvactivityindicatorviewable protocol you can use nvactivityindicatorview as ui blocker for uiviewcontroller swift class viewcontroller uiviewcontroller nvactivityindicatorviewable start animating swift startanimating size message plus other parameters as in initializer stop animating swift stopanimating check if it is animating swift animating isanimating or you can use nvactivityindicatorpresenter to display ui blocker anywhere start animating swift let activitydata activitydata nvactivityindicatorpresenter sharedinstance startanimating activitydata note check documentation for detail of activitydata stop animating swift nvactivityindicatorpresenter sharedinstance stopanimating change message swift nvactivityindicatorpresenter sharedinstance setmessage done check if it is animating swift animating nvactivityindicatorpresenter sharedinstance isanimating fade in out animation you have control over showing and hiding ui blocker animation swift startanimating fadeinanimation fadeinanimation stopanimating fadeoutanimation check default fade in animation and default fade out animation for examples of how to implement
