n – interactively manage your node js versions node js version management no subshells no profile setup no convoluted api just simple want to install node nightly releases try this unfortunately n is not supported on windows yet if youre able to make it work send in a pull request installation since you probably already have node the easiest way to install n is through npm npm install g n alternatively you can clone this repo and make install to install n to bin n of the directory specified in the environment variable prefix which defaults to usr local note that you will likely need to use sudo to install n in a custom location such as custom location bin n run prefix custom location make install once installed n installs node versions to subdirectory n versions of the directory specified in environment variable n prefix which defaults to usr local the active node iojs version is installed directly in n prefix to change the default to say home prefix later calls to n with n prefix home or add export n prefix home to your shell initialization file additionally consider third party installer n install which allows installation directly from github for instance curl l https git io n install bash sets both prefix and n prefix to home n installs n to home n bin modifies the initialization files of supported shells to export n prefix and add home n bin to the path and installs the latest stable node version as a result both n itself and all node versions it manages are hosted inside a single optionally configurable directory which you can later remove with the included n uninstall script n update updates n itself to the latest version see the n install repo for more details installing activating versions simply execute n version to install a version of node if version has already been installed via n n will activate that version n 0 8 14 n 0 8 17 n 0 9 6 execute n on its own to view your currently installed versions use the up and down arrow keys to navigate and press enter or the right arrow key to select use c control c to exit the selection screen if you like vim key bindings during the selection of node versions you can use j and k to navigate up or down without using arrows n 0 8 14 ο 0 8 17 0 9 6 use or install the latest official release n latest use or install the stable official release n stable use or install the latest lts official release n lts removing versions remove some versions n rm 0 9 4 v0 10 0 alternatively you can use in lieu of rm n 0 9 4 removing all versions except the current version bash n prune binary usage when running multiple versions of node we can target them directly by asking n for the binary path n bin 0 9 4 usr local n versions 0 9 4 bin node or by using a specific version through ns use sub command n use 0 9 4 some js flags also work here n as 0 9 4 debug some js working with npm after switching node js versions using n npm may not work properly this should fix it thanks mikemoser sh curl 0 l https npmjs com install sh sudo sh sudo may not be required depending on your system configuration usage output can also be obtained from n help usage n options env command args environments

help display help information q quiet disable curl output if available d download download only a arch override system architecture aliases which bin use as list ls rm custom source if you would like to use a project other than the official node js or io js projects you can use the special n project command which allows you to control the behavior of n using environment variables for example to grab the latest io js version but name it foo instead project name foo project url https iojs org dist n project latest required variables project name the name the project will be stored under project url the location to download the project from note this must follow the same format as the io js node js repos optional variables http user the username if the project url is protected by basic authentication http password the password if the project url is protected by basic authentication project version check many custom projects keep the same version number as the node js release they are based on and maintain their own separate version in process this allows you to define a javascript variable that will be used to check for the version of the process for example process versions node custom architecture by default n picks the binaries matching your system architecture e g n will download 64 bit binaries for a 64 bit system you can override this by using the a or arch option download and use latest 32 bit version of node n arch x86 latest download and use latest 32 bit version of iojs n io arch x86 latest download and use 64 bit lts version of node for older mac intel core 2 duo systems x86 image is no longer available but x64 runs fine n arch x64 lts additional details n installs versions to usr local n versions by default here it can see what versions are currently installed and activate previously installed versions accordingly when n version is invoked again activated versions are then installed to the prefix usr local which may be altered via the n prefix environment variable to alter where n operates simply export n prefix n does not work on windows at the moment pull requests are appreciated if you are searching for the latest version of n
