the silver searcher a code searching tool similar to ack with a focus on speed do you know c want to improve ag i invite you to pair with me whats so great about ag it is an order of magnitude faster than ack it ignores file patterns from your gitignore and hgignore if there are files in your source repo you dont want to search just add their patterns to a ignore file cough min js cough the command name is 33 shorter than ack and all keys are on the home row ag is quite stable now most changes are new features minor bug fixes or performance improvements its much faster than ack in my benchmarks ack test blah code 104 66s user 4 82s system 99 cpu 1 50 03 total ag test blah code 4 67s user 4 58s system 286 cpu 3 227 total ack and ag found the same results but ag was 34x faster 3 2 seconds vs 110 seconds my code directory is about 8gb thanks to git hg ignore ag only searched 700mb of that there are also graphs of performance across releases how is it so fast ag uses pthreads to take advantage of multiple cpu cores and search files in parallel files are mmap ed instead of read into a buffer literal string searching uses boyer moore strstr regex searching uses pcres jit compiler if ag is built with pcre 8 21 ag calls pcre study before executing the same regex on every file instead of calling fnmatch on every pattern in your ignore files non regex patterns are loaded into arrays and binary searched ive written several blog posts showing how ive improved performance these include how i added pthreads wrote my own scandir benchmarked every revision to find performance regressions and profiled with gprof and valgrind installing macos brew install the silver searcher or port install the silver searcher linux ubuntu 13 10 saucy or debian 8 jessie apt get install silversearcher ag fedora 21 and lower yum install the silver searcher fedora 22 dnf install the silver searcher rhel7 yum install epel release noarch the silver searcher gentoo emerge a sys apps the silver searcher arch pacman s the silver searcher slackware sbopkg i the silver searcher opensuse zypper install the silver searcher centos yum install the silver searcher suse linux enterprise follow these simple instructions bsd freebsdpkg install the silver searcher openbsd netbsd pkg add the silver searcher windows win32 64 unofficial daily builds are available chocolateychoco install ag msys2 pacman s mingw w64 i686 x86 64 ag cygwin run the relevant setup exe and select the silver searcher in the utils category building from source building master install dependencies automake pkg config pcre lzma macos brew install automake pkg config pcre xz or port install automake pkgconfig pcre xz ubuntu debian apt get install y automake pkg config libpcre3 dev zlib1g dev liblzma dev fedora yum y install pkgconfig automake gcc zlib devel pcre devel xz devel centos yum y groupinstall development tools yum y install pcre devel xz devel opensuse zypper source install build deps only the silver searcher windows its complicated see this wiki page run the build script which just runs aclocal automake etc build sh on windows inside an msys mingw shell make f makefile w32 make install sudo make install building a release tarball gpg signed releases are available here building release tarballs requires the same dependencies except for automake and pkg config once youve installed the dependencies just run configure make make install you may need to use sudo or run as root for the make install editor integration vim you can use ag with ack vim by adding the following line to your vimrc let g ackprg ag nogroup nocolor column or let g ackprg ag vimgrep which has the same effect but will report every match on the line emacs you can use ag el as an emacs front end to ag see also helm ag textmate textmate users can use ag with my fork of the popular ackmate plugin which lets you use both ack and ag for searching if you already have ackmate you just want to replace ack with ag move or delete library application support textmate plugins ackmate tmplugin contents resources ackmate ack and run ln s usr local bin ag library application support textmate plugins ackmate tmplugin contents resources ackmate ack other stuff you might like ack better than grep without ack ag would not exist ack vim exuberant ctags faster than ag but it builds an index beforehand good for really big codebases git grep as fast as ag but only works on git repos ripgrep sack a utility that wraps ack and ag it removes a lot of repetition from searching and opening matching files
