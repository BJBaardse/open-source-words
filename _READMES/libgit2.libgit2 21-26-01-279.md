libgit2 the git linkable library libgit2 is a portable pure c implementation of the git core methods provided as a linkable library with a solid api allowing to build git functionality into your application language bindings like rugged ruby libgit2sharp net pygit2 python and nodegit node allow you to build git tooling in your favorite language libgit2 is used to power git gui clients like gitkraken and gmaster and on git hosting providers like github gitlab and visual studio team services we perform the merge every time you click merge pull request libgit2 is licensed under a very permissive license gplv2 with a special linking exception this basically means that you can link it unmodified with any kind of software without having to release its source code additionally the example code has been released to the public domain see the separate license for more information table of contents quick start getting help what it can do optional dependencies initialization

prerequisites for building libgit2 cmake and is recommended to be installed into your path python is used by our test framework and should be installed into your path c compiler libgit2 is c90 and should compile on most compilers windows visual studio is recommended mac xcode is recommended unix gcc or clang is recommended build create a build directory beneath the libgit2 source directory and change into it mkdir build cd build create the cmake build environment cmake build libgit2 cmake build trouble with these steps read our troubleshooting guide docs troubleshooting md more detailed build guidance is available below getting help join us on slack visit slack libgit2 org to sign up then join us in libgit2 if you prefer irc you can also point your client to our slack channel once youve registered getting help if you have questions about the library please be sure to check out the api documentation if you still have questions reach out to us on slack or post a question on stackoverflow with the libgit2 tag reporting bugs please open a github issue and include as much information as possible if possible provide sample code that illustrates the problem youre seeing if youre seeing a bug only on a specific repository please provide a link to it if possible we ask that you not open a github issue for help only for bug reports reporting security issues in case you think to have found a security issue with libgit2 please do not open a public issue instead you can report the issue to the private mailing list security libgit2 com what it can do libgit2 provides you with the ability to manage git repositories in the programming language of your choice its used in production to power many applications including github com plastic scm and visual studio team services it does not aim to replace the git tool or its user facing commands some apis resemble the plumbing commands as those align closely with the concepts of the git system but most commands a user would type are out of scope for this library to implement directly the library provides sha conversions formatting and shortening abstracted odb backend system commit tag tree and blob parsing editing and write back tree traversal revision walking index file staging area manipulation reference management including packed references config file management high level repository management thread safety and reentrancy descriptive and detailed error messages and more over 175 different api calls as libgit2 is purely a consumer of the git system we have to adjust to changes made upstream this has two major consequences some changes may require us to change provided interfaces while we try to implement functions in a generic way so that no future changes are required we cannot promise a completely stable api as we have to keep up with changes in behavior made upstream we may lag behind in some areas we usually to document these incompatibilities in our issue tracker with the label git change optional dependencies while the library provides git functionality without the need for dependencies it can make use of a few libraries to add to it pthreads non windows to enable threadsafe access as well as multi threaded pack generation openssl non windows to talk over https and provide the sha 1 functions libssh2 to enable the ssh transport iconv osx to handle the hfs path encoding peculiarities initialization the library needs to keep track of some global state call git libgit2 init before calling any other libgit2 functions you can call this function many times a matching number of calls to git libgit2 shutdown will free the resources note that if you have worker threads you should call git libgit2 shutdown after those threads have exited if you require assistance coordinating this simply have the worker threads call git libgit2 init at startup and git libgit2 shutdown at shutdown threading see threading for information conventions see conventions for an overview of the external and internal api coding conventions we use building libgit2 using cmake building libgit2 builds cleanly on most platforms without any external dependencies under unix like systems like linux bsd and mac os x libgit2 expects pthreads to be available they should be installed by default on all systems under windows libgit2 uses the native windows api for threading the libgit2 library is built using cmake version 2 8 or newer on all platforms on most systems you can build the library using the following commands mkdir build cd build cmake cmake build alternatively you can point the cmake gui tool to the cmakelists txt file and generate platform specific build project or ide workspace running tests once built you can run the tests from the build directory with the command ctest v alternatively you can run the test suite directly using libgit2 clar invoking the test suite directly is useful because it allows you to execute individual tests or groups of tests using the s flag for example to run the index tests libgit2 clar sindex to run a single test named index racy diff which corresponds to the test function test index racy diff libgit2 clar sindex racy diff the test suite will print a for every passing test and an f for any failing test an s indicates that a test was skipped because it is not applicable to your platform or is particularly expensive note there should be no failing tests when you build an unmodified source tree from a release or from the master branch please contact us or open an issue if you see test failures installation to install the library you can specify the install prefix by setting cmake dcmake install prefix install prefix cmake build target install advanced usage for more advanced use or questions about cmake please read https cmake org wiki cmake faq the following cmake variables are declared bin install dir where to install binaries to lib install dir where to install libraries to include install dir where to install headers to build shared libs build libgit2 as a shared library defaults to on build clar build clar based test suite defaults to on threadsafe build libgit2 with threading support defaults to on stdcall build libgit2 as stdcall turn off for cdecl windows defaults to on to list all build options and their current value you can do the following create and set up a build directory mkdir build cmake list all build options and their values cmake l compiler and linker options cmake lets you specify a few variables to control the behavior of the compiler and linker these flags are rarely used but can be useful for 64 bit to 32 bit cross compilation cmake c flags set your own compiler flags cmake find root path override the search path for libraries zlib library openssl ssl library and openssl crypto library tell cmake where to find those specific libraries macos x if you want to build a universal binary for mac os x cmake sets it all up for you if you use dcmake osx architectures i386 x86 64 when configuring android extract toolchain from ndk using make standalone toolchain sh script optionally crosscompile and install openssl inside of it then create cmake toolchain file that configures paths to your crosscompiler substitute path with full path to the toolchain set cmake system name linux set cmake system version android set cmake c compiler path bin arm linux androideabi gcc set cmake cxx compiler path bin arm linux androideabi g set cmake find root path path sysroot set cmake find root path mode program never set cmake find root path mode
