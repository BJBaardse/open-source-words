bash ➜ apt get install vim e could not open lock file var lib dpkg lock open 13 permission denied e unable to lock the administration directory var lib dpkg are you root ➜ fuck sudo apt get install vim sudo password for nvbn reading package lists done requirements python 3 4 pip python dev installation on os x you can install the fuck via homebrew bash brew install thefuck on ubuntu install the fuck with the following commands bash sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 dev python3 pip sudo pip3 install thefuck on freebsd install the fuck with the following commands bash sudo portsnap fetch update cd usr ports misc thefuck sudo make install clean on chromeos install the fuck using chromebrew with the following command bash crew install thefuck on other systems install the fuck by using pip bash pip install thefuck alternatively you may use an os package manager os x ubuntu arch it is recommended that you place this command in your bash profile bashrc zshrc or other startup script bash eval thefuck alias you can use whatever you want as an alias like for mondays eval thefuck alias fuck or in your shell config bash zsh fish powershell tcsh changes are only available in a new shell session to make changes immediately available run source bashrc or your shell config file like zshrc to run fixed commands without confirmation use the yeah option or just y for short bash fuck yeah to fix commands recursively until succeeding use the r option bash fuck r updating bash pip3 install thefuck upgrade note alias functionality was changed in v1 34 of the fuck how it works

rule create a file named your rule name py in config thefuck rules the rule file must contain two functions python match command command bool get new command command command str list str additionally rules can contain optional functions python side effect old command command fixed command str none rules can also contain the optional variables enabled by default requires output and priority command has three attributes script output and script parts your rule should not change command rules api changed in 3 0 to access a rules settings import it with from thefuck conf import settings settings is a special object assembled from config thefuck settings py and values from env see more below a simple example rule for running a script with sudo python def match command return permission denied in

chmod 777 shell true priority 1000 lower first default is 1000 requires output true more examples of rules utility functions for rules app os specific helpers settings several the fuck parameters can be changed in the file xdg config home thefuck settings py xdg config home defaults to config rules – list of enabled rules by default thefuck conf default rules exclude rules – list of disabled rules by default require confirmation – requires confirmation before running new command by default true wait command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output no colors – disable colored output priority – dict with rules priorities rule with lower priority will be matched first debug – enables debug output by default false history limit – numeric value of how many history commands will be scanned like 2000 alter history – push fixed command to history by default true wait slow command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in slow

rules but would still like to share them with others create a package named thefuck contrib with the following structure thefuck contrib foo thefuck contrib foo rules init py third party rules init py third party utils setup py the fuck will find rules located in the rules module experimental instant mode the default behavior of the fuck requires time to re run previous commands when in instant mode the fuck saves time by logging output with script then reading the log currently instant mode only supports python 3 with bash or zsh zshs autocorrect function also needs to be disabled in order for thefuck to work properly to enable instant mode add enable experimental instant mode to the alias initialization in bashrc bash profile or zshrc for example bash eval thefuck alias enable
