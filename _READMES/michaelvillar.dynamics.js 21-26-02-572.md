dynamics js dynamics js is a javascript library to create physics based animations to see some demos check out dynamicsjs com usage download github releases npm npm install dynamics js bower bower install dynamics js include dynamics js into your page html script src dynamics js script you can animate css properties of any dom element javascript var el document getelementbyid logo dynamics animate el translatex 350 scale 2 opacity 0 5 type dynamics spring frequency 200 friction 200 duration 1500 you also can animate svg properties javascript var path document queryselector path dynamics animate path d m0 0 l0 100 l100 50 l0 0 z fill ff0000 rotatez 45 rotatecx and rotatecy are the center of the rotation rotatecx 100 rotatecy 100 friction 800 and any javascript object javascript var o number 10 color ffffff string 10deg array 1 10 dynamics animate o number 20 color 000000 string 90deg array 9 99 reference dynamics animate el properties options animates an element to the properties with the animation options el is a dom element a javascript object or an array of elements properties is an object of the properties values you want to animate options is an object representing the animation type is the animation type dynamics spring dynamics easeinout default dynamics easeinout frequency friction bounciness are specific to the animation type you are using duration is in milliseconds default 1000 delay is in milliseconds default 0 complete optional is the completion callback change optional is called at every change two arguments are passed to the function function el progress el is the element its animating progress is the progress of the animation between 0 and 1 dynamics stop el stops the animation applied on the element dynamics css el properties this is applying the css properties to your element with the correct browser prefixes el is a dom element properties is an object of the css properties dynamics settimeout fn delay dynamics js has its own settimeout the reason is that requestanimationframe and settimeout have different behaviors in most browsers requestanimationframe will not run in a background tab while settimeout will this can cause a lot of problems while using settimeout along your animations i suggest you use dynamicss settimeout and cleartimeout to handle these scenarios fn is the callback delay is in milliseconds returns a unique id dynamics cleartimeout id clears a timeout that was defined earlier id is the timeout id dynamics toggleslow toggle a debug mode to slow down every animations and timeouts this is useful for development mode to tweak your animation this can be activated using shift control d in the browser dynamics and properties dynamics spring frequency default is 300 friction default is 200 anticipationsize optional anticipationstrength optional dynamics bounce frequency default is 300 friction default is 200 dynamics forcewithgravity and dynamics gravity bounciness default is 400 elasticity default is 200 dynamics easeinout dynamics easein and dynamics easeout friction default is 500 dynamics linear no properties dynamics bezier points array of points and control points the easiest way to output this kind of array is to use the curve creator here is an example javascript x 0 y 0 cp x 0 2 y 0 x 0 5 y 0 4 cp x 0 4 y 0 4 x 0 8 y 0 4 x 1 y 1 cp x 0 8 y 1 contributing compile npm run build or npm run build watch run tests npm test browser support working on safari 7 firefox 35 chrome 34 ie10 sylvester some code from sylvester js has been used part of vector and matrix license the mit license mit copyright c 2015 michael villar permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files the software to deal in the software without restriction including without limitation the rights to use copy modify merge publish distribute sublicense and or sell copies of the software and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so subject to the following conditions the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software the software is provided as is without warranty of any kind express or implied including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim damages or other liability whether in an action of contract tort or otherwise arising from out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software
