welcome to openpilot openpilot is an open source driving agent currently it performs the functions of adaptive cruise control acc and lane keeping assist system lkas for hondas acuras and toyotas its about on par with tesla autopilot at launch and better than all other manufacturers the openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and enable rapid prototyping we look forward to your contributions improving real vehicle automation has never been easier here are some videos of it running and a really cool tutorial community openpilot is supported by comma ai we have a twitter you should follow also we have a 3500 person community on slack hardware right now openpilot supports the eon dashcam devkit wed like to support other platforms as well install openpilot on a neo device by entering https openpilot comma ai during neos setup supported cars honda acura honda accord 2018 with honda sensing alpha uses stock honda sensing for longitudinal control honda civic 2016 with

the lx have tss p it does not have steering assist and is not supported community maintained cars classic tesla model s pre ap how can i add support for my car if your car has adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist you are in luck using a panda and cabana you can understand how to make your car drive by wire weve written a porting guide for toyota that might help you after you have the basics figured out sadly bmw audi volvo and mercedes all use flexray and are unlikely to be supported any time soon we also put time into a ford port but the steering has a 10 second cutout limitation that makes it unusable directory structure cereal the messaging spec used for all logs on the phone common library like functionality weve developed here opendbc files showing how to interpret data

rudimentary infrastructure to run a basic simulation and generate a report of openpilots behavior in different scenarios bash requires working docker run docker tests sh the results are written to selfdrive test tests plant out longitudinal index html more extensive testing infrastructure and simulation environments are coming soon user data chffr account crash reporting by default openpilot
