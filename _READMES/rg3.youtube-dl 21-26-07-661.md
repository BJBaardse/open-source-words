configure youtube dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file on linux and macos the system wide configuration file is located at etc youtube dl conf and the user wide configuration file at config youtube dl config on windows the user wide configuration file locations are appdata \youtube dl\config txt or c \users\ user name \youtube dl conf note that by default configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself for example with the following configuration file youtube dl will always extract the audio not copy the mtime use a proxy and save all videos under movies directory in your home directory lines starting with are comments always extract audio x do not copy the mtime no mtime use this proxy proxy 127 0 0 1 3128 save all videos under movies directory in your home directory o movies title s ext s note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls thus there must be no whitespace after or e g o or proxy but not o or proxy you can use ignore config if you want to disable the configuration file for a particular youtube dl run you can also use config location if you want to use custom configuration file for a particular youtube dl run authentication with netrc file you may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication by providing login and password with username and password in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every youtube dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history you can achieve this using a netrc file on a per extractor basis for that you will need to create a netrc file in your home and restrict permissions to read write by only you touch home netrc chmod a rwx u rw home netrc after that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format where extractor is the name of the extractor in lowercase machine extractor login login password password for example machine youtube login myaccount gmail com password my youtube password machine twitch login my twitch account name password my twitch password to activate authentication with the netrc file you should pass netrc to youtube dl or place it in the configuration file on windows you may also need to setup the home environment variable manually for example set home userprofile output template the o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file names tl dr navigate me to examples the basic usage is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file like in youtube dl o funny video flv https some video however it may contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video the special sequences may be formatted according to python string formatting operations for example name s or name 05d to clarify that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses followed by a

output templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path e g o playlist s playlist index s title s ext s which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template any missing directory will be automatically created for you to use percent literals in an output template use to output to stdout use o the current default template is title s id s ext s in some cases you dont want special characters such as 中 spaces or such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a windows system or the filename through an 8bit unsafe channel in these cases add the restrict filenames flag to get a shorter title output template and windows batch files if you are using an output template inside a windows batch file then you must escape plain percent characters by doubling so that o title s id s ext s should become o title s id s ext s however you should not touch s that are not plain characters e g environment variables for expansion should stay intact o c

download the best available quality i e if you want the best quality you dont need to pass any special options youtube dl will guess it for you by default but sometimes you may want to download in a different format for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection the key mechanism for achieving this is so called format selection based on which you can explicitly specify desired format select formats based on some criterion or criteria setup precedence and much more the general syntax for format selection is format format or shorter f format where format is a selector expression i e an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download tl dr navigate me to examples the simplest case is requesting a specific format for example with f 22 you can download the format with format code equal to 22 you can get the list of available format codes for particular video using list formats or f note that these format codes are extractor specific you can also use a file extension currently 3gp aac flv m4a mp3 mp4 ogg wav webm are supported to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file e g f webm will download the best quality format with the webm extension served as a single file you can also use special names to select particular edge case formats best select the best quality format represented by a single file with video and audio worst select the worst quality format represented by a single file with video and audio bestvideo select the best quality video only format e g dash video may not be available worstvideo select the worst quality video only format may not be available bestaudio select the best quality audio only format may not be available worstaudio select the worst quality audio only format may not be available for example to download the worst quality video only format you can use f worstvideo if you want to download multiple videos and they dont have the same formats available you can specify the order of preference using slashes note that slash is left associative i e formats on the left hand side are preferred for example f 22 17 18 will download format 22 if its available otherwise it will download format 17 if its available otherwise it will download format 18 if its available otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download if you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator e g f 22 17 18 will download all these three formats of course if they are available or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature f 136 137 mp4 bestvideo 140 m4a bestaudio you can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets as in f best height 720 or f filesize 10m the following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons equals not equals filesize the number of bytes if known in advance width width of the video if known height height of the video if known tbr average bitrate of audio and video in kbit s abr average audio bitrate in kbit s vbr average video bitrate in kbit s asr audio sampling rate in hertz fps frame rate also filtering work for comparisons equals not equals begins with ends with contains and following string meta fields ext file extension acodec name of the audio codec in use vcodec name of the video codec in use container name of the container format protocol the protocol that will be used for the actual download lower case http https rtsp rtmp rtmpe mms f4m ism http dash segments m3u8 or m3u8 native format id a short description of the format note that none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor i e the metadata offered by the video hoster formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark after the operator you can combine format filters so f height 720 tbr 500 selects up to 720p videos or videos where the height is not known with a bitrate of at least 500 kbit s you can merge the video and audio of two formats into a single file using f video format audio format requires ffmpeg or avconv installed for example f bestvideo bestaudio will download the best video only format the best audio only format and mux them together with ffmpeg avconv format selectors can also be grouped using parentheses for example if you want to download the best mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480 you can use f mp4 webm height 480 since the end of april 2015 and version 2015 04 26 youtube dl uses f bestvideo bestaudio best as the default format selection see 5447 5456 if ffmpeg or avconv are installed this results in downloading bestvideo and bestaudio separately and muxing them together into a single file giving the best overall quality available otherwise it falls back to best and results in downloading the best available quality served as a single file best is also needed for videos that dont come from youtube because they dont provide the audio and video in two different files if you want to only download some dash formats for example if you are not interested in getting videos with a resolution higher than 1080p you can add f bestvideo height 1080 bestaudio best to your configuration file note that if you use youtube dl to stream to stdout and most likely to pipe it to your media player then i e you explicitly specify output template as o youtube dl still uses f best format selection in order to start content delivery immediately to your player and not to wait until bestvideo and bestaudio are downloaded and muxed if you want to preserve the old format selection behavior prior to youtube dl 2015 04 26 i e you want to download the best available quality media served as a single file you should explicitly specify your choice with f best you may want to add it to the configuration file in order not to type it every time you run youtube dl format selection examples note that on windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single bash download best mp4 format available or any other best if no mp4 available youtube dl f bestvideo ext mp4 bestaudio ext m4a best ext mp4 best download best format available but not better that 480p youtube dl f bestvideo height 480 bestaudio best height 480 download best video only format but no bigger than 50 mb youtube dl f best filesize 50m download best format available via direct link over http https protocol youtube dl f bestvideo bestaudio best protocol http download the best video format and the best audio format without merging them youtube dl f bestvideo bestaudio o title s f format id s ext s note that in the last example an output template is recommended as bestvideo and bestaudio may have the same file name video selection videos can be filtered by their upload date using the options date datebefore or dateafter they accept dates in two formats absolute dates dates in the format yyyymmdd relative dates dates in the format now today 0 9 day week month year s examples bash download only the videos uploaded in the last 6 months youtube dl dateafter now

update youtube dl if youve followed our manual installation instructions you can simply run youtube dl u or on linux sudo youtube dl u if you have used pip a simple sudo pip install u youtube dl is sufficient to update if you have installed youtube dl using a package manager like apt get or yum use the standard system update mechanism to update note that distribution packages are often outdated as a rule of thumb youtube dl releases at least once a month and often weekly or even daily simply go to https yt dl org to find out the current version unfortunately there is nothing we youtube dl developers can do if your distribution serves a really outdated version you can and should complain to your distribution in their bugtracker or support forum as a last resort you can also uninstall the version installed by your package manager and follow our manual installation instructions for that remove the distributions package with a line like sudo apt get remove y youtube dl afterwards simply follow our manual installation instructions sudo wget https yt dl org latest youtube dl o usr local bin youtube dl sudo chmod a x usr local bin youtube dl hash r again from then on youll be able to update with sudo youtube dl u youtube dl is extremely slow to start on windows add a file exclusion for youtube dl exe in windows defender settings im getting an error unable to extract opengraph title on youtube playlists youtube changed their playlist format in march 2014 and later on so youll need at least youtube dl 2014 07 25 to download all youtube videos if you have installed youtube dl with a package manager pip setup py or a tarball please use that to update note that ubuntu packages do not seem to get updated anymore since we are not affiliated with ubuntu there is little we can do feel free to report bugs to the ubuntu packaging people all they have to do is update the package to a somewhat recent version see above for a way to update im getting an error when trying to use output template error using output template conflicts with using title video id or auto number make sure you are not using o with any of these options t title id a or auto number set in command line or in a configuration file remove the latter if any do i always have to pass citw by default youtube dl intends to have the best options incidentally if you have a convincing case that these should be different please file an issue where you explain that therefore it is unnecessary and sometimes harmful to copy long option strings from webpages in particular the only option out of citw that is regularly useful is i can you please put the b option back most people asking this question are not aware that youtube dl now defaults to downloading the highest available quality as reported by youtube which will be 1080p or 720p in some cases so you no longer need the b option for some specific videos maybe youtube does not report them to be available in a specific high quality format youre interested in in that case simply request it with the f option and youtube dl will try to download it i get http error 402 when trying to download a video whats this apparently youtube requires you to pass a captcha test if you download too much were considering to provide a way to let you solve the captcha but at the moment your best course of action is pointing a web browser to the youtube url solving the captcha and restart youtube dl do i need any other programs youtube dl works fine on its own on most sites however if you want to convert video audio youll need avconv or ffmpeg on some sites most notably youtube videos can be retrieved in a higher quality format without sound youtube dl will detect whether avconv ffmpeg is present and automatically pick the best option videos or video formats streamed via rtmp protocol can only be downloaded when rtmpdump is installed downloading mms and rtsp videos requires either mplayer or mpv to be installed i have downloaded a video but how can i play it once the video is fully downloaded use any video player such as mpv vlc or mplayer i extracted a video url with g but it does not play on another machine in my web browser it depends a lot on the service in many cases requests for the video to download play it must come from the same ip address and with the same cookies and or http headers use the cookies option to write the required cookies into a file and advise your downloader to read cookies from that file some sites also require a common user agent to be used use dump user agent to see the one in use by youtube dl you can also get necessary cookies and http headers from json output obtained with dump json it may be beneficial to use ipv6 in some cases the restrictions are only applied to ipv4 some services sometimes only for a subset of videos do not restrict the video url by ip address cookie or user agent but these are the exception rather than the rule please bear in mind that some url protocols are not supported by browsers out of the box including rtmp if you are using g your own downloader must support these as well if you want to play the video on a machine that is not running youtube dl you can relay the video content from the machine that runs youtube dl you can use o to let youtube dl stream a video to stdout or simply allow the player to download the files written by youtube dl in turn error no fmt url map or conn information found in video info youtube has switched to a new video info format in july 2011 which is not supported by old versions of youtube dl see above for how to update youtube dl error unable to download video youtube requires an additional signature since september 2012 which is not supported by old versions of youtube dl see above for how to update youtube dl video url contains an ampersand and im getting some strange output 1 2839 or v is not recognized as an internal or external command thats actually the output from your shell since ampersand is one of the special shell characters its interpreted by the shell preventing you from passing the whole url to youtube dl to disable your shell from interpreting the ampersands or any other special characters you have to either put the whole url in quotes or escape them with a backslash which approach will work depends on your shell for example if your url is https www youtube com watch t 4 v baw jenozkc you should end up with following command youtube dl https www youtube com watch t 4 v baw jenozkc or youtube dl https www youtube com watch t 4\ v baw jenozkc for windows you have to use the double quotes youtube dl https www youtube com watch t 4 v baw jenozkc extractorerror could not find js function uof in february 2015 the new youtube player contained a character sequence in a string that was misinterpreted by old versions of youtube dl see above for how to update youtube dl http error 429 too many requests or 402 payment required these two error codes indicate that the service is blocking your ip address because of overuse contact the service and ask them to unblock your ip address or if you have acquired a whitelisted ip address already use the proxy or source address options to select another ip address syntaxerror non ascii character the error file youtube dl line 2 syntaxerror non ascii character \x93 means youre using an outdated version of python please update to python 2 6 or 2 7 what is this binary file where has the code gone since june 2012 342 youtube dl is packed as an executable zipfile simply unzip it might need renaming to youtube dl zip first on some systems or clone the git repository as laid out above if you modify the code you can run it by executing the main py file to recompile the executable run make youtube dl the exe throws an error due to missing msvcr100 dll to run the exe you need to install first the microsoft visual c 2010 redistributable package x86 on windows how should i set up ffmpeg and youtube dl where should i put the exe files if you put youtube dl and ffmpeg in the same directory that youre running the command from it will work but thats rather cumbersome to make a different directory work either for ffmpeg or for youtube dl or for both simply create the directory say c \bin or c \users\ user name \bin put all the executables directly in there and then set your path environment variable to include that directory from then on after restarting your shell you will be able to access both youtube dl and ffmpeg and youtube dl will be able to find ffmpeg by simply typing youtube dl or ffmpeg no matter what directory youre in how do i put downloads into a specific folder use the o to specify an output template for example o home user videos title s id s ext s if you want this for all of your downloads put the option into your configuration file how do i download a video starting with a either prepend https www youtube com watch v or separate the id from the options with youtube dl wnyeurxzfu youtube dl https www youtube com watch v wnyeurxzfu how do i pass cookies to youtube dl use the cookies option for example cookies path to cookies file txt in order to extract cookies from browser use any conforming browser extension for exporting cookies for example cookies txt for chrome or export cookies for firefox note that the cookies file must be in mozilla netscape format and the first line of the cookies file must be either http cookie file or netscape http cookie file make sure you have correct newline format in the cookies file and convert newlines if necessary to correspond with your os namely crlf \r\n for windows and lf \n for unix and unix like systems linux macos etc http error 400 bad request when using cookies is a good sign of invalid newline format passing cookies to youtube dl is a good way to workaround login when a particular extractor does not implement it explicitly another use case is working around captcha some websites require you to solve in particular cases in order to get access e g youtube cloudflare how do i stream directly to media player you will first need to tell youtube dl to stream media to stdout with o and also tell your media player to read from stdin it must be capable of this for streaming and then pipe former to latter for example streaming to vlc can be achieved with youtube dl o https www youtube com watch v baw jenozkcj vlc how do i download only new videos from a playlist use download archive feature with this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with download archive path to download archive file txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file each subsequent run with the same download archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file for example at first youtube dl download archive archive txt https www youtube com playlist list plwiyx1dc3p2jr9n8gqaqn bcvlslap7re will download the complete plwiyx1dc3p2jr9n8gqaqn bcvlslap7re playlist and create a file archive txt each subsequent run will only download new videos if any youtube dl download archive archive txt https www youtube com playlist list plwiyx1dc3p2jr9n8gqaqn bcvlslap7re should i add hls prefer native into my config when youtube dl detects an hls video it can download it either with the built in downloader or ffmpeg since many hls streams are slightly invalid and ffmpeg youtube dl each handle some invalid cases better than the other there is an option to switch the downloader if needed when youtube dl knows that one particular downloader works better for a given website that downloader will be picked otherwise youtube dl will pick the best downloader for general compatibility which at the moment happens to be ffmpeg this choice may change in future versions of youtube dl with improvements of the built in downloader and or ffmpeg in particular the generic extractor used when your website is not in the list of supported sites by youtube dl cannot mandate one specific downloader if you put either hls prefer native or hls prefer ffmpeg into your configuration a different subset of videos will fail to download correctly instead it is much better to file an issue or a pull request which details why the native or the ffmpeg hls downloader is a better choice for your use case can you add support for this anime video site or site which shows current movies for free as a matter of policy as well as legality youtube dl does not include support for services that specialize in infringing copyright as a rule of thumb if you cannot easily find a video that the service is quite obviously allowed to distribute i e that has been uploaded by the creator the creators distributor or is published under a free license the service is probably unfit for inclusion to youtube dl a note on the service that they dont host the infringing content but just link to those who do is evidence that the service should not be included into youtube dl the same goes for any dmca note when the whole front page of the service is filled with videos they are not allowed to distribute a fair use note is equally unconvincing if the service shows copyright protected videos in full without authorization support requests for services that do purchase the rights to distribute their content are perfectly fine though if in doubt you can simply include a source that mentions the legitimate purchase of content how can i speed up work on my issue also known as help my important issue not being solved the youtube dl core developer team is quite small while we do our best to solve as many issues as possible sometimes that can take quite a while to speed up your issue heres what you can do first of all please do report the issue at our issue tracker that allows us to coordinate all efforts by users and developers and serves as a unified point unfortunately the youtube dl project has grown too large to use personal email as an effective communication channel please read the bug reporting instructions below a lot of bugs lack all the necessary information if you can offer proxy vpn or shell access to the youtube dl developers if you are able to test the issue from multiple computers in multiple countries to exclude local censorship or misconfiguration issues if nobody is interested in solving your issue you are welcome to take matters into your own hands and submit a pull request or coerce pay somebody else to do so feel free to bump the issue from time to time by writing a small comment issue is still present in youtube dl version from france but fixed from belgium but please not more than once a month please do not declare your issue as important or urgent how can i detect whether a given url is supported by youtube dl for one have a look at the list of supported sites note that it can sometimes happen that the site changes its url scheme say from https example com video 1234567 to https example com v 1234567 and youtube dl reports an url of a service in that list as unsupported in that case simply report a bug it is not possible to detect whether a url is supported or not thats because youtube dl contains a generic extractor which matches all urls you may be tempted to disable exclude or remove the generic extractor but the generic extractor not only allows users to extract videos from lots of websites that embed a video from another service but may also be used to extract video from a service that its hosting itself therefore we neither recommend nor support disabling excluding or removing the generic extractor if you want to find out whether a given url is supported simply call youtube dl with it if you get no videos back chances are the url is either not referring to a video or unsupported you can find out which by examining the output if you run youtube dl on the console or catching an unsupportederror exception if you run it from a python program why do i need to go through that much red tape when filing bugs before we had the issue template despite our extensive bug reporting instructions about 80 of the issue reports we got were useless for instance because people used ancient versions hundreds of releases old because of simple syntactic errors not in youtube dl but in general shell usage because the problem was already reported multiple times before because people did not actually read an error message even if it said please install ffmpeg because people did not mention the url they were trying to download and many more simple easy to avoid problems many of whom were totally unrelated to youtube dl youtube dl is an open source project manned by too few volunteers so wed rather spend time fixing bugs where we are certain none of those simple problems apply and where we can be reasonably confident to be able to reproduce the issue without asking the reporter repeatedly as such the output of youtube dl v your url here is really all thats required to file an issue the issue template also guides you through some basic steps you can do such as checking that your version of youtube dl is current developer instructions most users do not need to build youtube dl and can download the builds or get them from their distribution to run youtube dl as a developer you dont need to build anything either simply execute python m youtube dl to run the test simply invoke your favorite test runner or execute a test file directly any of the following work python m unittest discover python test test download py nosetests see item 6 of new extractor tutorial for how to run extractor specific test cases if you want to create a build of youtube dl yourself youll need python make only gnu make is supported pandoc zip nosetests adding support for a new site if you want to add support for a new site first of all make sure this site is not dedicated to copyright infringement youtube dl does not support such sites thus pull requests adding support for them will be rejected after you have ensured this site is distributing its content

yourextractor finally create a pull request well then review and merge it in any case thank you very much for your contributions youtube dl coding conventions this section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic robust and future proof extractor code extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change as an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the sources layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that this is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube dl versions working even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube dl with a fix incorporated all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us needless to say some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all mandatory and optional metafields for extraction to work youtube dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube dl expressed by an information dictionary or simply info dict only the following meta fields in the info dict are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by youtube dl id media identifier title media title url media download url or formats in fact only the last option is technically mandatory i e if you cant figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense but by convention youtube dl also treats id and title as mandatory thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken any field apart from the aforementioned ones are considered optional that means that extraction should be tolerant to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable even if they are always available at the moment and future proof in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields example say you have some source dictionary meta that youve fetched as json with http request and it has a key summary python meta self download json url video id assume at this point metas layout is python summary some fancy summary text assume you want to extract summary and put it into the resulting info dict as description since description is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the meta dict so that you should extract it like python description meta get summary correct and not like python description meta summary incorrect the latter will break extraction process with keyerror if summary disappears from meta at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with description set to none which is perfectly fine remember none is equivalent to the absence of data similarly you should pass fatal false when extracting optional data from a webpage with search regex html search regex or similar methods for instance python description self search regex r span id title webpage description fatal false with fatal set to false if search regex fails to extract description it will emit a warning and continue extraction you can also pass default some fallback value for example python description self search regex r span id title webpage description default none on failure this code will silently continue the extraction with description set to none that is useful for metafields that may or may not be present provide fallbacks when extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources for example if title is present in several places try extracting from at least some of them this makes it more future proof in case some of the sources become unavailable example say meta from the previous example has a title and you are about to extract it since title is a mandatory meta field you should end up with something like python title meta title if title disappears from meta in future due to some changes on the hosters side the extraction would fail since title is mandatory thats expected assume that you have some another source you can extract title from for example og title html meta of a webpage in this case you can provide a fallback scenario python title meta get title or self og search title webpage this code will try to extract from meta first and if it fails it will try extracting og title from a webpage make regular expressions flexible when using regular expressions try to write them fuzzy and flexible example say you need to extract title from the following html code html span style position absolute left 910px width 90px float right z index 9999 class title some fancy title span the code for that task should look similar to python title self search regex r span class title webpage title or even better python title self search regex r span class \ title\1 p title webpage title group title note how you tolerate potential changes in the style attributes value or switch from using double quotes to single for class attribute the code definitely should not look like python title self search regex r span style position absolute left 910px width 90px float right z index 9999 class title span webpage title group title use safe conversion functions wrap all extracted numeric data into safe functions from utils int or none float or none use them for string to number conversions as well embedding youtube dl youtube dl makes the best effort to be a good command line program and thus should be callable from any programming language if you encounter any problems parsing its output feel free to create a report from a python program you can embed youtube dl in a more powerful fashion like this python from future import unicode literals import youtube dl ydl opts with youtube dl youtubedl ydl opts as ydl ydl download https

g1d0487f rtmpdump 2 4 debug proxy map do not post screenshots of verbose logs only plain text is acceptable the output including the first lines contains important debugging information issues without the full output are often not reproducible and therefore do not get solved in short order if ever please re read your issue once again to avoid a couple of common mistakes you can and should use this as a checklist is the description of the issue itself sufficient we often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher while in most cases we eventually get the required information after asking back multiple times this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources many contributors including myself are also not native speakers so we may misread some parts so please elaborate on what feature you are requesting or what bug you want to be fixed make sure that its obvious what the problem is how it could be fixed how your proposed solution would look like if your report is shorter than two lines it is almost certainly missing some of these which makes it hard for us to respond to it were often too polite to close the issue outright but the missing info makes misinterpretation likely as a committer myself i often get frustrated by these issues since the only possible way for me to move forward on them is to ask for clarification over and over for bug reports this means that your report should contain the complete output of youtube dl when called with the v flag the error message you get for most bugs even says so but you would not believe how many of our bug reports do not contain this information if your server has multiple ips or you suspect censorship adding call home may be a good idea to get more diagnostics if the error is error unable to extract and you cannot reproduce it from multiple countries add dump pages warning this will yield a rather large output redirect it to the file log txt by adding log txt 2 1 to your command line or upload the dump files you get when you add write pages somewhere site support requests must contain an example url an example url is a url you might want to download like https www youtube com watch v baw jenozkc there should be an obvious video present except under very special circumstances the main page of a video service e g https www youtube com is not an example url are you using the latest version before reporting any issue type youtube dl u this should report that youre up to date about 20 of the reports we receive are already fixed but people are using outdated versions this goes for feature requests as well is the issue already documented make sure that someone has not already opened the issue youre trying to open search at the top of the window or browse the github issues of this repository if there is an issue feel free to write something along the lines of this affects me as well with version 2015 01 01 here is some more information on the issue while some issues may be old a new post into them often spurs rapid activity why are existing options not enough before requesting a new feature please have a quick peek at the list of supported options many feature requests are for features that actually exist already please absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail how the existing similar options do not solve your problem is there enough context in your bug report people want to solve problems and often think they do us a favor by breaking down their larger problems e g wanting to skip already downloaded files to a specific request e g requesting us to look whether the file exists before downloading the info page however what often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps one simple and one impossible or extremely complicated one we are then presented with a very complicated request when the original problem could be solved far easier e g by recording the downloaded video ids in a separate file to avoid this you must include the greater context where it is non obvious in particular every feature request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing feature would be useful does the issue involve one problem and one problem only some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or should open there is no limit of issues they can or should open while it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one ticket that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot mark the issue as closed typically reporting a bunch of issues leads to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones in particular every site support request issue should only pertain to services at one site generally under a common domain but always using the same backend technology do not request support for vimeo user videos white house podcasts and google plus pages in the same issue also make sure that you dont post bug reports alongside feature requests as a rule of thumb a feature request does not include outputs of youtube dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new video service is anyone going to need the feature only post features that you or an incapacitated friend you can personally talk to require do not post features because they seem like a good idea if they are really useful they will be requested by someone who requires them is your question about youtube dl it may sound strange but some bug reports we receive are completely unrelated to youtube dl and relate to a different or even the reporters own application please make sure that you are actually using youtube dl if you are using a ui for youtube dl report the bug to the maintainer of the actual application providing the ui on the other hand if your ui for youtube dl fails in some way you believe is related to youtube dl by all means go ahead and report the bug copyright youtube dl is released into the public domain by the copyright holders this readme file was originally written by daniel bolton and is likewise released into the public domain
