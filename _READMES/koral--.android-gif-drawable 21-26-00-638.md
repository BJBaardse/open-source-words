android gif drawable views and drawable for animated gifs in android overview bundled giflib via jni is used to render frames this way should be more efficient than webview or movie classes javadoc setup gradle android studio insert the following dependency to build gradle file of your project groovy dependencies compile pl droidsonroids gif android gif drawable 1 2 14 note that maven central repository should be defined eg in top level build gradle like this groovy buildscript repositories mavencentral allprojects repositories mavencentral gradle snapshot repository current development builds build from dev branch are published to oss snapshot repository to use them specify repository url in repositories block groovy repositories mavencentral maven url https oss sonatype org content

level 14 for giftextureview hardware accelerated rendering for gifteximage2d opengl es 2 0 building from source android ndk needed to compile native sources usage sample project see sample directory sample project is under construction not all features are covered yet from xml the simplest way is to use gifimageview or gifimagebutton like a normal imageview xml pl droidsonroids gif gifimageview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent android src drawable src anim android background drawable bg anim if drawables declared by android src and or android background are gif files then they will be automatically recognized as gifdrawables and animated if given drawable is not a gif then mentioned views work like plain imageview and imagebutton giftextview allows you to use gifs as compound drawables and background xml pl droidsonroids gif giftextview android layout width match parent android layout height match parent android drawabletop drawable left anim android drawablestart drawable left anim android background drawable bg anim from java code gifimageview gifimagebutton and giftextview have also hooks for setters implemented so animated gifs can be set by calling setimageresource int resid and setbackgroundresource int resid gifdrawable can be constructed directly from various sources java asset file gifdrawable giffromassets new gifdrawable getassets anim gif resource drawable or raw gifdrawable giffromresource new gifdrawable getresources r drawable anim uri contentresolver contentresolver can be null for file uris gifdrawable

are closed automatically in finalizer if gifdrawable is no longer needed so you dont need to explicitly close them callingrecycle will also close underlying input source note that all input sources need to have ability to rewind to the beginning it is required to correctly play animated gifs where animation is repeatable since subsequent frames are decoded on demand from source animation control gifdrawable implements an animatable and mediaplayercontrol so you can use its methods and more stop stops the animation can be called from any thread start starts the animation can be called from any thread isrunning returns whether animation is currently running or not reset rewinds the animation does not restart stopped one setspeed float factor sets new animation speed factor eg passing 2 0f will double the animation speed seekto int position seeks animation within current loop to given position in milliseconds getduration returns duration of one loop of the animation getcurrentposition returns elapsed time from the beginning of a current loop of animation using mediaplayercontrol standard controls for a mediaplayer like in videoview can be used to control gif animation and show its current progress just set gifdrawable as mediaplayer on your mediacontroller like this java override protected void oncreate bundle savedinstancestate super oncreate savedinstancestate gifimagebutton gib new gifimagebutton this setcontentview gib gib setimageresource r drawable sample final mediacontroller mc new mediacontroller this mc setmediaplayer gifdrawable gib getdrawable mc setanchorview gib gib setonclicklistener new onclicklistener override public void onclick view v mc show retrieving gif metadata getloopcount returns a loop count as defined in netscape 2 0 extension getnumberofframes returns number of frames at least 1 getcomment returns comment text null if gif has no comment getframebytecount returns minimum number of bytes that can be used to store pixels of the single frame getallocationbytecount returns size in bytes of the allocated memory used to store pixels of given gifdrawable getinputsourcebytecount returns length in bytes of the backing input data tostring returns human readable information about image size and number of frames intended for debugging purpose associating single gifdrawable instance with multiple views normally single gifdrawable instance associated with multiple views will animate only on the last one to solve that create multicallback instance add views to it and set callback for given drawable e g java multicallback multicallback new multicallback imageview setimagedrawable gifdrawable multicallback addview imageview anotherimageview setimagedrawable gifdrawable multicallback addview anotherimageview gifdrawable setcallback multicallback note that if you change a drawable of e g imageview the callback will be removed from the previous drawable thereafter you have to reassign callback or the same gifdrawable instance will stop animating see 480 for more information advanced recycle provided to speed up freeing memory like in android graphics bitmap isrecycled checks whether drawable is recycled geterror returns last error details upgrading from 1 2 8 minimum sdk version changed minimum api level is now 14 android 4 0 upgrading from 1 2 3 meaningful only if consumer proguard rules bundled with library are not used they are used by default by gradle proguard rule has changed to keep public class pl droidsonroids gif gifioexception init int java lang string upgrading from 1 1 17 1 1 17 is the last version supporting api level 8 froyo starting from 1 2 0 minimum api level is 9 gingerbread upgrading from 1 1 13 handling of several edge cases has been changed gifdrawable getnumberofframes now returns 0 when gifdrawable is recycled information included in result of gifdrawable tostring when gifdrawable is recycled now contains zeroes only upgrading from 1 1 10 it is recommended but not required to call libraryloader initialize before using gifdrawable context is needed in some cases when native libraries cannot be extracted normally see relinker for more details if libraryloader initialize was not called and normal library loading fails context will be tried to be retrieved in fall back way which may not always work upgrading from 1 1 9 int parameter loopnumber has been added to animationlistener onanimationcompleted upgrading from 1 1 8 proguard configuration not needed proguard configuration is now bundled with the library you dont need to specify it yourself upgrading from 1 1 3 src xml attribute in giftextureview has been renamed to gifsource to avoid possible conflicts with other libraries upgrading from 1 0 x proguard configuration update proguard configuration has changed to keep public class pl droidsonroids gif gifioexception init int keep class pl droidsonroids gif gifinfohandle init long int int int drawable recycling behavior change gifdrawable now uses android graphics bitmap as frame buffer trying to access pixels including drawing of recycled gifdrawable will cause illegalstateexception like in bitmap minimum sdk version changed minimum api level is now 8 android 2 2 rendering moved to background thread rendering is performed in background thread running independently from main thread so animation is running even if drawable is not drawn however rendering is not running if drawable is not visible see setvisible that method can be used to control drawable visibility in cases when it is not already handled by android framework references this library uses code from giflib 5 1 3 and skia projects using android gif drawable imagefactory nativescript plugin by brad martin available on
