view of the slidingmenu viewbehind a reference to the layout that you want to use as the behind view of the slidingmenu touchmodeabove an enum that designates what part of the screen is touchable when the above view is showing margin means only the left margin fullscreen means the entire screen default is margin behindoffset a dimension representing the number of pixels that you want the above view to show when the behind view is showing default is 0 behindwidth a dimension representing the width of the behind view default is the width of the screen equivalent to behindoffset 0 behindscrollscale a float representing the relationship between the above view scrolling and the behind behind view scrolling if set to 0 5f the behind view will scroll 1px for every 2px that the above view scrolls if set to 1 0f the behind view will scroll 1px for every 1px that the above view scrolls and if set to 0 0f the behind view will never scroll it will be static this one is fun to play around with default is 0 25f shadowdrawable a reference to a drawable to be used as a drop shadow from the above view onto the below view default is no shadow for now shadowwidth a dimension representing the width of the shadow drawable default is 0 fadeenabled a boolean representing whether or not the behind view should fade when the slidingmenu is closing and un fade when opening fadedegree a float representing the amount of fade 1 0f would mean fade all the way to black when the slidingmenu is closed 0 0f would mean do not fade at all selectorenabled a boolean representing whether or not a selector should be drawn on the left side of the above view showing a selected view on the behind view selectordrawable a reference to a drawable to be used as the selector note in order to have the selector drawn you must call slidingmenu setselectedview view v with the selected view note that this will most likely not work with items in a listview because of the way that android recycles item views caveats your layouts have to be based on a viewgroup unfortunatly this negates the merge optimisations developed by jeremy feinstein license copyright 2012 2014 jeremy feinstein licensed under the apache license
