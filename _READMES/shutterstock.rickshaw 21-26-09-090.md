please keep comment here to allow auto update getting started getting started with a simple graph is straightforward heres the gist javascript var graph new rickshaw graph element document queryselector graph series color steelblue data x 0 y 23 x 1 y 15 x 2 y 79 color lightblue data x 0 y 30 x 1 y 20 x 2 y 64 graph render see the overview tutorial and examples for more install in the browser manually add rickshaw min js and rickshaw min css in the document head alternatively you can install rickshaw using bower or npm sh with bower bower install rickshaw with npm npm install save rickshaw dependencies rickshaw relies on the fantastic d3 visualization library to do lots of the heavy lifting for stacking and rendering to svg some extensions require jquery and jquery ui but for drawing some basic graphs youll be okay without rickshaw uses jsdom to run unit tests in node to be able to do svg manipulation as of the jsdom 7 0 0 release jsdom requires node js 4 or newer jsdom changelog if you want to run the tests on your machine and you dont have access to a version of node 4 0 you can npm install jsdom 3 so that you can run the tests using the 3 x branch of jsdom rickshaw graph a rickshaw graph send an element reference series data and optionally other properties to the constructor before calling render to point the graph a listing of properties follows send these as arguments to the constructor and optionally set them later on already instantiated graphs with a call to configure element a reference to an html element that should hold the graph series array of objects containing series data to plot each object should contain data at a minimum a sorted array of objects each with x and y properties optionally send a name and color as well some renderers and extensions may also support additional keys renderer a string containing the name of the renderer to be used options include area stack bar line and scatterplot defaults to line also see the multi meta renderer in order to support different renderers per series width width of the graph in pixels falls back to the width of the element or defaults to 400 if the element has no width height height of the graph in pixels falls back to the height of the element or defaults to 250 if the element has no height min lower value on the y axis or auto for the lowest value in the series defaults to 0 max highest value on the y axis defaults to the highest value in the series padding an object containing any of top right bottom and left properties specifying a padding percentage around the extrema of the data in the graph defaults to 0 01 on top for 1 padding and 0 on other sides padding on the bottom only applies when the ymin is either negative or auto interpolation line smoothing interpolation method see d3 docs notable options linear straight lines between points step after square steps from point to point cardinal smooth curves via cardinal splines default basis smooth curves via b splines stack allows you to specify whether series should be stacked while in the context of stacking renderers area bar etc defaults to stack true to unstack unstack true methods once you have instantiated a graph call methods below to get pixels on the screen change configuration and set callbacks render draw or redraw the graph configure set properties on an instantiated graph specify any properties the constructor accepts including width and height and renderer call render to redraw the graph and reflect newly configured properties onupdate f add a callback to run when the graph is rendered extensions once you have a basic graph extensions let you add functionality see the overview and examples listing for more rickshaw graph legend add a basic legend rickshaw graph hoverdetail show details on hover rickshaw graph jsonp get data via a jsonp request rickshaw graph annotate add x axis annotations rickshaw graph rangeslider dynamically zoom on the x axis with a slider rickshaw graph rangeslider preview pan and zoom via graphical preview of entire data set rickshaw graph axis time add an x axis and grid lines with time labels rickshaw graph axis x add an x axis and grid lines with arbitrary labels rickshaw graph axis y add a y axis and grid lines rickshaw graph axis y scaled add a y axis with an alternate scale rickshaw graph behavior series highlight highlight series on legend hover rickshaw graph behavior series order reorder series in the stack with drag and drop rickshaw graph behavior series toggle toggle series on and off through the legend rickshaw color palette rickshaw comes with a few color schemes instantiate a palette and specify a scheme name and then call color on the palette to get each next color javascript var palette new rickshaw color palette scheme spectrum2001 palette color first color in the palette palette color next color in the palette optionally to palette color can take a numeric argument to specify which color from the palette should be used zero indexed this can be helpful when assigning a color to series of a plot with particular meaning javascript var palette new rickshaw color palette scheme colorwheel palette color 0 first color in the palette red in this example palette color 2 third color in the palette light blue color schemes classic9 colorwheel cool munin spectrum14 spectrum2000 spectrum2001 interpolation for graphs with more series than palettes have colors specify an interpolatedstopcount to the palette constructor rickshaw and cross browser support this library works in modern browsers and internet explorer 9 rickshaw relies on the htmlelement classlist api which isnt natively supported in internet explorer 9 rickshaw adds support by including a shim which implements the classlist api by extending the htmlelement prototype you can disable this behavior if you like by setting rickshaw no compat to a true value before including the library minification if your project uses minification you will need to give a hint to the minifier to leave variables named super named super for example with uglify on the command line uglify js reserved names super rickshaw js rickshaw min js or a sample configuration with grunt contrib uglify javascript uglify options mangle except super development for building we use node and npm running npm run build or make should get you going with any luck after doing a build you can run the tests with the command npm test for more availible options see the package json scripts section contributing pull requests are always welcome please follow a few guidelines please dont include updated versions of rickshaw js and rickshaw min js just changes to the source files will suffice add a unit test or two to cover the proposed changes do as the romans do and stick with existing whitespace and formatting conventions i e tabs instead of spaces etc consider adding a simple example under examples that demonstrates any
