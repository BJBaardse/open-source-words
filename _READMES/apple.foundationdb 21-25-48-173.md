foundationdb is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers it organizes data as an ordered key value store and employs acid transactions for all operations it is especially well suited for read write workloads but also has excellent performance for write intensive workloads users interact with the database using api language binding to learn more about foundationdb visit foundationdb org documentation documentation can be found online at https apple github io foundationdb the documentation covers details of api usage background information on design philosophy and extensive usage examples docs are built from the source in this repo forums the foundationdb forums are the home for most of the discussion and communication about the foundationdb project we welcome your participation we want foundationdb to be a great project to be a part of and as part of that have established a code of conduct to establish what constitutes permissible modes of interaction contributing contributing to foundationdb can be in contributions to the code base sharing your experience and insights in the community on the forums or contributing to projects that make use of foundationdb please see the contributing guide for more specifics getting started binary downloads developers interested in using the foundationdb store for an application can get started easily by downloading and installing a binary package please see the downloads page for a list of available packages compiling from source developers on a os for which there is no binary package or who would like to start hacking on the code can get started by compiling from source macos check out this repo on your mac install the xcode command line tools download version 1 52 of boost set the boostdir environment variable to the location containing this boost installation install mono install a jdk foundationdb currently builds with java 8 navigate to the directory where you checked out the foundationdb repo run make linux install docker check out the foundationdb repo build linux docker image using the file dockerfile located in the build source directory run the docker image interactively docker run with the directory containing the foundationdb repo mounted docker mounts docker run it v local dir path foundationdb docker dir path foundationdb bin bash navigate to the mounted directory containing the foundationdb repo cd docker dir path foundationdb run make this will build the fdbserver binary and the python bindings if you want to build our other bindings you will need to install a runtime for the language whose binding you want to build each binding has an mk file which provides specific targets for that binding
