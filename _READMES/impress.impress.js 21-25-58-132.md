of each plugin js contains js impress js which contains a concatenation of the core src impress js and all the plugins traditionally this is the file that youll link to in a browser in fact both the demo and test files do exactly that css contains a css file used by the demo this file is not required for using impress js in your own presentations impress js creates the css it needs dynamically extras contains plugins that for various reasons arent enabled by default you have to explicitly add them with their own script element to use them build js simple build file that creates js impress js it also creates a minified version impress min js but that one is not included in the github repository package json an npm package specification this was mainly added so you can easily install buildify and run node build js other than the build process which is really just doing roughly cat src impress js src plugins js js impress js and testing impress js itself doesnt depend on node or any npm modules bower json a bower package file we also dont depend on bower but provide this file if you want to use it want to contribute for developers once youve made changes to the code you should run these commands for testing npm run build npm run test npm run lint note that running firefox qunit test runner html is usually more informative than running karma with npm run test they both run the same tests more info about the src directory can be found in src plugins readme md about the name impress js name is courtesy of skuzniak its an un fortunate coincidence that a open libreoffice presentation tool is called impress reference api see the reference api browser support the design goal for impress js has been to showcase awesome css3 features as found in modern browser versions we also use some new dom functionality and specifically do not use jquery or any other javascript libraries nor our own functions to support older browsers in general recent versions of firefox and chrome are known to work well reportedly ie now works too the typical use case for impress js is to create presentations that you present from your own laptop with a browser version you know works well some people also use impress js successfully to embed animations or presentations in a web page however be aware that in this some of your visitors may not see the presentation correctly or at all in particular impress js makes use of the following js and css features dataset api classlist api css 3d transforms css transitions copyright and license copyright 2011 2016 bartek
