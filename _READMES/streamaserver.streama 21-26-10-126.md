streama ever had a huge bookshelf full of shows and movies ever wanted to digitalize them but didnt have a good way of organizing the files worry no more streama is your own personal netflix for just

getting started free free to chat with us on discord we are more than happy to assist and then improve the docs accordingly downloads stable and beta versions see the github releases unstable alpha builds see streamabuilds the application settings when you first run the application you will be redirected to the settings page here you enter your desired upload directory for the video files your themoviedb org api key and a different base url if so desired useful for remote hosting once you made adjustments to any of the settings make sure to validate the value before saving for the api key the validation checks against themoviedb org to see if youve entered a valid api key for the upload directory the application checks if it has read write permissions for it the dashboard on the dashboard a user can see their recently watched tv shows and movies and their progress they can continue where they left off as well start new shows and movies that they havent yet seen the continue watching feature works by periodically updating the database only while watching of course with info about the currently watched video and how far it has been seen if a movie or episode does not contain any video files it wont show up in the dashboard the player the streama player is heavily inspired by netflix so you get all the good stuff from there for shows there is a next episode button and a handy episode season browser there are also the basics volume control play pause and fullscreen later down the road i will add a feature to add subtitles and switch between video files for instance for different quality uploads the player is html5 based and has only really been tested in chrome so far the episode browser i am especially proud of the episode browser which aims to function just like on netflix by default the current video files season is selected the user gets an overview of which other episodes there are in the season how many seasons there are and as an added feature the user sees all the added episodes even if no video files are added to them thus greyed out the admin panel one of the most important things to me was to make managing shows movies and episodes as easy and fun as possible for this i made heavy use of the api from themoviedatabase org which auto fills the episodes shows and movies with useful information and great images this eases the users role in adding content for example creating a new tv show and the episodes for the first season looks something like this uploading video files for each episode is as easy as drag and drop accessing existing files if you want to avoid uploading every file use our new and improved local file feature instead you can define a local directory i use one directly in which i created symlinks to all my mounted drives and then you can either use the local file browser for individual movies tv shows or you can use the bulk create feature the local file browser you can access the local file browser from any movie or tv show anywhere where you would otherwise upload a file note you need to first define the local directory in the settings bulk create from file this mr addresses the issue batch add files 241 note the tv show does not have to be present in order for this to work everything will be created by the backend running matcher previewing result adding single matched file adding files in bulk customizing the matcher just like in emby or kodi the matcher regex can be altered the two defaults are movie name \ \d 4 \ tvshow episode name s season \d 2 e episode \d 2 3 in order to customize the regex just add the regex in the bottom of the application yml like so yml streama regex movies \d 4 shows s \d 2 e \d 2 3 the users users can be invited and managed in the admin panel by default they are non admins meaning they can only view videos not create them you can make them admins with the press of a button since there is user administration in place i plan on expanding on this a lot another feature i want to add is the ability for users to add and administer some form of playlists there is a lot of potential to make this even better technical details this application is web based the server side is written on grails 3 with springsecurity for login user handling for all the front end components angularjs is used and the player is completely html5 based the application is essentially split into grails for a rest api and angularjs for the frontend streama uses the awesome api from themoviedatabase for all media metadata changelog please refer to description of each release or the git log roadmap streama is still very much a work in progress we will be adding new features and bug fixes often but this is a hobby project for the core

improvements that are in the issue tracker take a look at the milestones for what we intend to add for upcoming releases contributing features improvements and bugfixes streama currently only has 2 3 core contributers so we are grateful for any extra contributions send though a pull request and we will review it asap if youre not sure what to work on take a look at the issues theres lots to do
