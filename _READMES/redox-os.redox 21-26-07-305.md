redox is an operating system written in rust a language with focus on safety and high performance redox following the microkernel design aims to be secure usable and free redox is inspired by previous kernels and operating systems such as sel4 minix plan 9 and bsd redox is not just a kernel its a full featured operating system providing packages memory allocator file system display manager core utilities etc that together make up a functional and convenient operating system you can loosely think of it as the gnu or bsd ecosystem but in a memory safe language and with modern technology see this list for overview of the ecosystem the website can be found at https www redox os org please make sure you use the latest nightly of rustc before building for more troubleshooting see help redox wont compile contents what it looks like ecosystem help redox wont compile contributing to redox cloning building and running quick setup manual setup setup using docker what it looks like ecosystem the ecosystem and software redox os provides is listed below name lexicographic order maintainer acid kernel integration tests jackpot51 co ticki nilset binutils ticki bots custom mattermost bots ticki cookbook jackpot51 coreutils ticki co stratact extrautils ticki games ticki ion shell skylerberg jackpot51 kernel jackpot51 libextra ticki libpager ticki netutils jackpot51 orbclient orbital client jackpot51 orbdata jackpot51 orbgame orbital 2d game engine flovangh orbital windowing and compositing system jackpot51 orbtk orbital toolkit stratact orbutils orbital utilities jackpot51 pkgutils current package manager jackpot51 playbot internal repl bot ticki ralloc ticki ransid rust ansi driver jackpot51 redoxfs old filesystem jackpot51 syscall jackpot51 sodium vim inspired text editor ticki tfs ticki filesystem ticki the redox book ticki userutils jackpot51 libstd abandoned rusts official libstd is now used the old kernel abandoned zfs abandoned superseded by tfs help redox wont compile sometimes things go wrong when compiling try the following before opening an issue make sure you have a redox toolchain x86 64 unknown redox gcc you can install from deb packages https static redox os org toolchain apt or build redox os libc manually run rustup update run make clean pull make sure you have the latest version of rust nightly rustup rs is recommended for managing rust versions if you already have it run rustup update gnu make nasm and qemu virtualbox pull the upstream master branch git remote add upstream git github com redox os redox git git pull upstream master update submodules git submodule update recursive init and then rebuild contributing to redox if youre interested in this project and youd like to help us out here is a list of ways you can do just that cloning building and running redox is big even compressed downloading the full history may take a lot of bandwidth and can even be costly on some data plans clone at your own risk quick setup bash cd path to your projects folder run bootstrap setup curl sf https raw githubusercontent com redox os redox master bootstrap sh o bootstrap sh bash e bootstrap sh change to project directory cd redox build redox make all launch using qemu make qemu launch using qemu without using kvm kernel based virtual machine try if qemu gives an error make qemu kvm no qemu with kvm to use qemu with kvm kernel based virtual machine which is faster than without kvm you need a cpu with intel® virtualization technology intel® vt or amd virtualization™ amd v™ support most systems have this disabled by default so you may need to reboot go into the bios and enable it manual setup to manually clone build and run redox using a unix based host run the following commands with exceptions be sure to read the comments bash cd path to your projects folder https git clone https github com redox os redox git origin upstream recursive ssh git clone git github com redox os redox git origin upstream recursive cd redox install update dependencies bootstrap sh d install rustup rs curl https sh rustup rs ssf sh source home cargo env install the sysroot manager xargo cargo install xargo for successive builds start here if this is your first build just continue update git submodules git submodule update recursive init build redox make all launch using qemu make qemu launch using qemu without using kvm kernel based virtual machine try if qemu gives an error make qemu kvm no launch using qemu without using kvm kernel based virtual machine nor graphics make qemu kvm no vga no setup using docker we also provide docker image after cloning this repository please follow readme under the docker directory updating the codebase using the makefile to update the codebase run make pull make fetch make pull pulls and updates the submodules and make fetch updates the sources for cookbook recipes
