mnemonics and consistency just clone it launch it then press the space bar to explore the interactive list of carefully chosen key bindings you can also press the home buffers button for some great first key bindings to try spacemacs can be used naturally by both emacs and vim users you can even mix the two editing styles switching easily between input styles makes spacemacs a great tool for pair programming spacemacs is currently in beta and contributions are very welcome features great documentation access documentation in emacs with spc h spc beautiful gui youll love the distraction free ui and its functional mode line excellent ergonomics all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the space bar or alt m mnemonic key bindings commands have mnemonic prefixes like spc b for all the buffer commands or spc p for the project commands batteries included discover hundreds of ready to use packages nicely organised in configuration layers following a set of conventions documentation comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing spc h spc you can also check the general documentation quick start guide and the faq getting help if you need help ask

spacemacs requires emacs 24 4 or above the development version of emacs at the time of writing this is 25 2 is not officially supported but should nevertheless be expected to work some modes require third party tools that youll have to install via your favorite package manager linux distros install emacs from the package manager of your linux distribution you should install the emacs package not the xemacs package xemacs is an old fork of emacs the x in its name is unrelated to x11 both emacs and xemacs have graphical support note ubuntu lts 12 04 and 14 04 repositories have only emacs 24 3 available you have to build from source emacs 24 4 or greater as spacemacs wont work with 24 3 the same may be true for other distributions as well macos the recommended way of installing emacs on macos is using homebrew sh brew tap d12frosted emacs plus brew install emacs plus brew linkapps emacs plus note these homebrew commands will install gnu emacs and link it to your applications directory you still need to run the git clone mentioned at the start of this file that will populate your emacs d directory which is what transforms a regular gnu emacs into spacemacs note the proposed emacs plus tap is identical to the emacs formulae it just builds gnu emacs with support of several features by default along with providing spacemacs icon see emacs plus for more information note to have the title bar match your theme background color consider using instead sh brew install emacs plus head with natural title bars note after you have completed the install process below it is also recommended to add the osx layer to your dotfile install instructions are available in the osx layer documentation note if the powerline separators on the spaceline are a different less saturated color than the rest of the line you can add following snippet to dotspacemacs user config in your spacemacs file elisp setq ns use srgb colorspace nil keep in mind that this is not ideal solution as it affects all colours in emacs another option is to use different powerline separator for example alternate and bar diminishes the difference and using utf 8 separator makes it go away completely without the need to change colour space in order to change powerline separator put following snippet in dotspacemacs user config eslip setq powerline default separator utf 8 for more information about powerline separators please refer to appropriate section in documentation windows you can download good quality builds from the emacs w64 project it is recommended to install the most recent stable build be sure to declare a environment variable named home pointing to your user directory c \users\ username then you can clone spacemacs in this directory sometimes youll get the following error when you first start emacs the directory emacs d server is unsafe to fix it change the owner of the directory emacs d server from properties select the tab “security” select the button “advanced” select the tab “owner” change the owner to your account name source stack overflow for efficient searches we recommend to install pt the platinum searcher pt version 1 7 7 or higher is required install default installation if you have an existing emacs configuration back it up first sh cd mv emacs d emacs d bak mv emacs emacs bak dont forget to backup and remove emacs file otherwise spacemacs will not load since that file prevents emacs from loading the proper initialization file clone the repository sh git clone https github com syl20bnr spacemacs emacs d master is the stable branch and it is immutable do not make any modification to it or you will break the update mechanism if you want to fork spacemacs safely use the develop branch where you handle the update manually optional install the source code pro font if you are running in terminal youll also need to change font settings of your terminal launch emacs spacemacs will automatically install the packages it requires if you get an error regarding package downloads then you may try to disable the https protocol by starting emacs with sh emacs insecure or you can set the dotspacemacs elpa https to nil in your dotfile to remove the need to start emacs with insecure argument you may wish to clear out your emacs d elpa directory before doing this so that any corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re installed restart emacs to complete the installation if the mode line turns red then be sure to consult the faq alternate installations it may be useful to clone spacemacs outside emacs dotdirectory emacs d so you can try spacemacs without replacing completely our own configuration there is currently two possibilities to support alternative location for spacemacs configuration modify home environment variable this solution is ideal to quickly try spacemacs without compromising your existing configuration sh mkdir spacemacs git clone https github com syl20bnr spacemacs git spacemacs emacs d home spacemacs emacs note if youre on fish shell you will need to modify the last command to env home home spacemacs emacs modify spacemacs start directory variable this solution is better suited to embed spacemacs into your own configuration say you cloned spacemacs in emacs d spacemacs then drop these lines in emacs d init el elisp setq spacemacs start directory emacs d spacemacs load file concat spacemacs start directory init el spacemacs logo for ubuntu users follow this guide to change the logo in unity for mac users you need to download the icns version of the logo then change the logo on dock update spacemacs has a built in notification of a new version when you are on the master branch if you are on the develop branch then youll have to update spacemacs manually by updating your repository automatic update on master branch when a new version is available a little arrow appears in the mode line its color depends on the number of versions available since your last update green means that your current version is recent orange and red mean that your current version is older click on the arrow to update spacemacs to the last version manual update on master branch remove the angle brackets when typing the lines below into your shell sh git fetch git reset hard tag version which you are updating to on develop branch update emacs packages by clicking press ret on the update packages link of the starting page close emacs and update the git repository sh git pull rebase restart emacs to complete the upgrade revert to a specific version to revert to a specific version you just have to checkout the corresponding branch for instance to revert to the last 0 103 sh git checkout origin release 0 103 after you update either manually or automatically you are advised to update your packages by clicking the update packages button on the spacemacs home buffer quotes quote by ashnur «i feel that spacemacs is an aircraft carrier and i am playing table tennis on the deck as a freerider » quote by deuill «i love spacemacs and magit that is all» contributions spacemacs is a community driven project it needs you to keep it up to date and
