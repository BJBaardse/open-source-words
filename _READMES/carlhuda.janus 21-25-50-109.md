janus vim distribution this is a distribution of plug ins and mappings for vim gvim and macvim it is designed to provide minimal working environment using the most popular plug ins and the most common mappings the distribution is completely customisable using a vimrc before and vimrc after vim rc files updating to the latest version to update to the latest version of the distribution just run rake inside your vim directory note if you ever have an error updating janus relating to a missing commit in a submodule please try running rake again before submitting an issue mailing list the mailing list is hosted at google groups please join it for discussion and announcements pre requisites the distribution is designed to work with vim 7 3 the distribution also requires ack ctags git ruby and rake for the most comfortable experience use the gui version of vim linux users should install gvim osx users should install macvim the recommended way of installing macvim is using homebrew but before installing macvim you need to use system wide python if you are using python that is if youre using pythonbrew do pythonbrew off bash brew install macvim if you dont use homebrew you can still download macvim here take a look at the pre requisites wiki page for more information installation to install janus please use our automatic installer which backs up any vim files found in your home folder and installs janus bash curl l https bit ly janus bootstrap bash customization you can use gvimrc before and vimrc before for settings janus itself uses such as the leader setting you may also use gvimrc after and vimrc after for any additional settings it is also a good place for overriding janus settings as both files will be loaded at the end of janus for example to override the default color schemes bash echo color desert vimrc after echo color molokai gvimrc after if you want to do additional customization or add more vim plugins create a janus directory and add your plugins there either with a git clone or by adding submodules to your own git repository there this directory is treated like a normal pathogen directory for example bash cd janus git clone https github com vim scripts rename2 git rename2 or if you have a git repository in janus you can use a submodule bash cd janus git submodule add https github com vim scripts rename2 git rename2 if you would like to disable an included plug in you can do that with the janus disable plugin function from inside your vimrc before this function takes a plug in name as an argument without the group for example if you would like to disable the nerdcommenter plug in you can do that with the command bash echo call janus disable plugin nerdcommenter vimrc before warning weve noticed over and over that people fork janus just to customize it this is bad practice for several reasons and you should not do that and heres why janus is fully customisable and theres no need to change the core for using a different plugin fork or using a different mapping forking means maintenance maintenance means burden do not burden yourself with maintaining a fork thats what the janus folder is for if you find yourself needing a customisation that is not possible with the current setup then please open an issue or consider submitting a pull request to make it possible to continue using improving the official repo warning any uncommited files inside the janus folder will be removed the next time you run rake so make sure to either put them in the custom folder janus or commit them we clean the janus folder in case we replace a manually installed plugin using rake tasks with a submodule for more information on how to customize janus you might want to take a look at the customization wiki page additional you

2 spaces show trailing whitespace as make searching highlighted incremental and case insensitive unless a capital letter is used always show a status line allow backspacing over everything indentations eol and start characters in insert mode c p inserts the directory of the current file into a command automatically resize splits when resizing the vim window gui only leader ew expands to e directory of current file open in the current buffer leader es expands to sp directory of current file open in a horizontal split leader ev expands to vsp directory of current file open in a vertical split leader et expands to tabe directory of current file open in a new tab write a privileged file with sudow or sudowrite it will prompt for sudo password when writing f4 toggles paste mode leader fef formats the entire file leader u converts the entire word to uppercase leader l converts the entire word to lowercase leader u converts the first char of a word to uppercase leader l converts the first char of a word to lowercase leader cd changes the path to the active buffers file leader md creates the directory of the active buffers file for example when editing a new file for which the path does not exist gw swaps the current word with the following word leader ul underlines the current line with leader tw toggles wrap leader fc finds the next conflict marker tested with git conflicted files remap down and up to gj and gk wrapped text is not considered a single long line of text leader hs toggles highlight search leader adjusts viewports to the same size c w a d on macvim shifts current line or selected lines rightwards a d on macvim shifts current line or selected lines leftwards c w invokes kwbd plugin it closes all open buffers in the open windows but keeps the windows open ack vim ack vim uses ack to search inside the current directory for a pattern you can learn more about it with help ack customizations janus rebinds command shift f d f to bring up ack ctrlp fuzzy file buffer mru and tag finder replaces command t customizations for users of command t janus maps ctrlp to command t d t nerdcommenter nerdcommenter allows you to wrangle your code

nerdtree buffer on the left and one or more editing buffers on the right unimpaired this plugin provides a lot of useful mappings heres a brief example of what it does provide b to go to the previous buffer b to go to the next buffer n to go to the previous scm conflict marker n to go to the next scm conflict marker please check help unimpaired for a complete list supertab in insert mode start typing something and hit tab to tab complete based on the current context syntastic syntastic is a syntax checking plugin that runs files through external syntax checkers as they are saved and opened if syntax errors are detected the user is notified and is happy because they didnt have to compile their code or execute their script to find them please see help syntastic for more information tagbar tagbar is a vim plugin for browsing the tags of source code files customizations janus binds leader rt to toggle tagbar snipmate snipmate defines text snippets a series of characters that expand to a useful piece of code when tab is pressed for example in a ruby file def tab expands to ruby def method name end after typing in the method name press tab again to put the cursor right where you want it on the next line this repository has a full list of the snippets that are available in janus easymotion easymotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim it takes the number out of number w or number f char by highlighting all possible choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target when one of the available motions is triggered all visible text preceding or following the cursor is faded and motion targets are highlighted easymotion is triggered by one of the provided mappings check easymotions home page for more information nrrwrgn narrowing means focussing on a region and making the rest inaccessible you simply select the region call narrowregion and the selected part will open in a new scratch buffer the rest of the file will be protected so you wont accidentally modify that buffer in the new buffer you can do a global replace search or anything else to modify that part when you are finished simply write that buffer e g by w and your modifications will be put in the original buffer making it accessible again git support fugitive fugitive adds pervasive git support to git directories in vim for more information use help fugitive use gstatus to view git status and type on any file to stage or unstage it type p on a file to enter git add p and stage specific hunks in the file use gdiff on an open file to see what changes have been made to that file customizations leader gb maps to gblame cr leader gs maps to gstatus cr leader gd maps to gdiff cr leader gl maps to glog cr leader gc maps to gcommit cr leader gp maps to git push cr git gutter a vim plugin which shows a git diff in the gutter sign column it shows whether each line has been added modified and where lines have been removed you can also stage and revert individual hunks zoomwin when working with split windows zoomwin lets you zoom into a window and out again using ctrl w o customizations janus binds leader zw to zoomwin json better json and

buffers to edit upon invocation using the command buffergatoropen or buffergatortoggle or the provided key mapping leader b a catalog of listed buffers are displayed in a separate new window split vertical or horizontal based on user options default vertical from this buffer catalog a buffer can be selected and opened in an existing window a new window split vertical or horizontal or a new tab page selected buffers can be previewed i e opened in a window or tab page but with focus remaining in the buffer catalog even better you can walk up and down the list of buffers shown in the catalog by using c n or space c p or c space these keys select the next previous buffer in succession respectively opening it for preview without leaving the buffer catalog viewer vroom vroom is a plugin inspired by gary bernhardts vim config for running your ruby tests specs features imagine youre hacking on a rails controller when you switch to the test or specs for the controller you can use leader r to run all the specs or leader r to run the closest spec then you can jump back to the controller hack on it and use leader r to run the last spec you ran last time so you dont need to open the test again then benefits of this plugin are to centralize your workflow in one window one software to do it all which is a huge speedup over using tmux or multiple terminal tabs vim multiple cursors out of the box all you need to know is a single key ctrl n pressing the key in normal mode highlights the current word under the cursor in visual mode and places a virtual cursor at the end of it pressing it again finds the next occurrence and places another virtual cursor at the end of the visual selection if you select multiple lines in visual mode pressing the key puts a virtual cursor at every line and leaves you in normal mode more at quickstart vim trailing whitespace this plugin causes all trailing whitespace to be highlighted in red to fix the whitespace errors just call fixwhitespace by default it operates on the entire file pass a range or use v to select some lines to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed additional syntaxes janus ships with a few additional syntaxes
