perfect scrollbar minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin to read documentation for versions 1 0 please visit v0 8 1 why perfect scrollbar perfect scrollbar is minimalistic but perfect for me and maybe for most developers scrollbar plugin no change on design layout no manipulation on dom tree use plain scrolltop and scrollleft scrollbar style is fully customizable efficient update on layout change i hope you love it demo its on the github pages table of contents install before using perfect scrollbar caveats how to use options events helpdesk ie support license install npm the best way to install and use perfect scrollbar is with npm its registered as perfect scrollbar npm install perfect scrollbar manual download you can manually download perfect scrollbar from releases from sources if you want to use the development version of the plugin build from source manually the development version may be unstable git clone https github com utatti perfect scrollbar git cd perfect scrollbar npm install npm run build jsfiddle you can fork the following jsfiddles for testing and experimenting purposes perfect scrollbar jsfiddle unofficial sources sources not mentioned above are not maintained officially if there are issues of the following sources please ask and resolve in each repository before using perfect scrollbar the following requirements should meet the container must have a position style the container must be a normal container element the following requirements are included in the basic css but please keep in mind when youd like to change the css files the container must have an overflow hidden css style the scrollbars position must be absolute the scrollbar x must have bottom or top and the scrollbar y must have right or left finally scroll hooking is generally considered as a bad practice and perfect scrollbar should be used carefully unless custom scroll is really needed using browser native scroll is always recommended caveats perfect scrollbar emulates some scrolls but not all of the kinds it also does not work in some situations you can find these cases in caveats basically items listed in the caveats are hacky to implement and may not be implemented in the future if the features are really needed please consider using browser native scroll how to use first of all please check if the container element meets the requirements
