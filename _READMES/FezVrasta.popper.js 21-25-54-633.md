ignore the html block below the interesting part is after it popper js a library used to position poppers in web applications ðŸš¨ hey here begins the interesting stuff ðŸš¨ wut poppers a popper is an element on the screen which pops out from the natural flow of your application common examples of poppers are tooltips popovers and drop downs so yet another tooltip library well basically no popper js is a positioning engine its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element the engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as modifiers similar to middlewares or plugins the whole code base is written in es2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to saucelabs and travisci popper js has zero dependencies no jquery no lodash nothing its used by big companies like twitter in bootstrap v4 microsoft in webclipper and atlassian in atlaskit popper js this is the engine the library that computes and optionally applies the styles to the poppers some of the key points are position elements keeping them in their original dom context doesnt mess with your dom allows to export the computed informations to integrate with react and other view libraries supports shadow dom elements completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure visit our project page to see a lot of examples of what you can do with popper js find the documentation here tooltip js since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects we created tooltip js its a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine popper js its api is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of bootstrap in this way it will be easy to integrate it in your projects the tooltips generated by tooltip js are accessible thanks to the aria tags find the documentation here installation popper js is available on the following package managers and cdns source npm npm install popper js save yarn yarn add popper js nuget pm install package popper js bower bower install popper js save unpkg https unpkg com popper js unpkg minified https unpkg com popper js dist umd popper min js tooltip js as well source npm npm install tooltip js save yarn yarn add tooltip js bower bower install tooltip js https unpkg com tooltip js save unpkg https unpkg com tooltip js unpkg minified https unpkg com tooltip js dist umd tooltip min js bower isnt officially supported it can be used to install tooltip js only trough the unpkg com cdn this method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library bower and popper js suggests to use npm or yarn for your projects for more info read the related issue dist targets popper js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind umd esm and esnext no idea what am i talking about you are looking for umd probably umd universal module definition amd requirejs and globals esm es modules for webpack rollup or browser supporting the spec esnext available in dist can be used with webpack and babel preset env make sure to use the right one for your needs if you want to import it with a script tag use umd if you cant find the dist folder in the git repository this is because the distribution files are shipped only to bower npm or our cdns you can still find them visiting https unpkg com popper js dist or https unpkg com tooltip js dist usage given an existing popper dom node ask popper js to position it near its button js var reference document queryselector my button var popper document queryselector my popper var anotherpopper new popper reference popper popper options here callbacks popper js supports two kinds of callbacks the oncreate callback is called after the popper has been initialized the onupdate one is called on any subsequent update js const reference document queryselector my button const popper document queryselector my popper new popper reference popper oncreate data data is an object containing all the informations computed by popper js and used to style the popper and its arrow the complete description is available in popper js documentation onupdate data same as oncreate but called on subsequent updates writing your own modifiers popper js is based on a plugin like architecture most of its features are fully encapsulated modifiers a modifier is a function that is called each time popper js needs to compute the position of the popper for this reason modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks to learn how to create a modifier read the modifiers documentation react vue js angular angularjs ember js etc integration integrating 3rd party libraries in react or other libraries can be a pain because they usually alter the dom and drive the libraries crazy popper js limits all its dom modifications inside the applystyle modifier you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using your library of choice for a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use popper js into existing frameworks visit the mentions page alternatively you may even override your own applystyles with your custom one and integrate popper js by yourself js function applyreactstyle data export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper const reference document queryselector my button const popper document queryselector my popper new popper reference popper modifiers applystyle enabled false applyreactstyle enabled true fn applyreactstyle order 900 how to use popper js in jest it is recommended that users mock popper js for use in jest tests due to some limitations of jsdom the simplest way to mock popper js is to place the following code in mocks popper js js adjacent to your node modules directory jest will pick it up automatically js import popperjs from popper js export default class popper static placements popperjs placements constructor return destroy scheduleupdate alternatively you can manually mock popper js for a particular test js jest mock popper js const popperjs jest requireactual popper js return class popper static placements popperjs placements constructor return destroy scheduleupdate migration from popper js v0 since the api changed we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to popper js v1 https github com fezvrasta popper js issues 62 feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions performances popper js is very performant it usually takes 0 5ms to compute a poppers position on an imac with 3 5g ghz intel core i5 this means that it will not cause any jank leading to a smooth user experience notes libraries using popper js the aim of popper js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to be used in 3rd party libraries visit the mentions page for an updated list of projects credits i want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did andreascn for his work on the github page and the manual testing he did during the development vampolo for the original idea and for the name of the library sysdig for all the awesome things i learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library tether js for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world the contributors for their much appreciated pull requests and bug reports you for the star youll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try ðŸ™‚ copyright and
