overview libuv is a multi platform support library with a focus on asynchronous i o it was primarily developed for use by node js but its also used by luvit julia pyuv and others feature highlights full featured event loop backed by epoll kqueue iocp event ports asynchronous tcp and udp sockets asynchronous dns resolution asynchronous file and file system operations file system events ansi escape code controlled tty ipc with socket sharing using unix domain sockets or named pipes windows child processes thread pool signal handling high resolution clock threading and synchronization primitives versioning starting with version 1 0 0 libuv follows the semantic versioning scheme the api change and backwards compatibility rules are those indicated by semver libuv will keep a stable abi across major releases the abi api changes can be tracked here licensing libuv is licensed under the mit license check the license file the documentation is licensed under the cc by 4 0 license check the license docs file community support mailing list irc chatroom libuv irc freenode org documentation official documentation located in the docs subdirectory it uses the sphinx framework which makes it possible to build the documentation in multiple formats show different supported building options bash make help build documentation as html bash make html build documentation as html and live reload it when it changes this requires sphinx autobuild to be installed and is only supported on unix bash make livehtml build documentation as man pages bash make man build documentation as epub bash make epub note windows users need to use make bat instead of plain make documentation can be browsed online here the tests and benchmarks also serve as api specification and usage examples other resources lxjs 2012 talk — high level introductory talk about libuv libuv dox — documenting types and methods of libuv mostly by reading uv h learnuv — learn uv for fun and profit a self guided workshop to libuv these resources are not handled by libuv maintainers and might be out of date please verify it before opening new issues downloading libuv can be downloaded either from the github repository or from the downloads site starting with libuv 1 7 0 binaries for windows are also provided this is to be considered experimental before verifying the git tags or signature files importing the relevant keys is necessary key ids are listed in the maintainers file but are also available as git blob objects for easier use importing a key the usual way bash gpg keyserver pool sks keyservers net recv keys ae9bc059 importing a key from a git blob object bash git show pubkey saghul gpg import verifying releases git tags are signed with the developers key they can be verified as follows bash git verify tag v1 6 1 starting with libuv 1 7 0 the tarballs stored in the downloads site are signed and an accompanying signature file sit alongside each once both the release tarball and the signature file are downloaded the file can be verified as follows bash gpg verify libuv 1 7 0 tar gz sign build instructions for gcc there are two build methods via autotools or via gyp gyp is a meta build system which can generate msvs makefile and xcode backends it is best used for integration into other projects to build with autotools bash sh autogen sh configure make make check make install windows prerequisites python 2 6 or 2 7 as it is required by gyp if python is not in your path set the environment variable python to its location for example set python c \python27\python exe one of visual c build tools visual studio 2015 update 3 all editions including the community edition remember to select common tools for visual c 2015 feature during installation visual studio 2017 any edition including the build tools sku required components msbuild vc 2017 v141 toolset and one of the windows sdks 10 or 8 1 basic unix tools required for some tests git for windows includes git bash and tools which can be included in the global path to build launch a git shell e g cmd or powershell run vcbuild bat to build with vs2017 you need to explicitly add a vs2017 argument which will checkout the gyp code into build gyp generate uv sln as well as the necesery related project files and start building console vcbuild or console vcbuild vs2017 to run the tests console vcbuild test to see all the options that could passed to vcbuild console vcbuild help vcbuild bat debug release test bench clean noprojgen nobuild vs2017 x86 x64 static shared examples vcbuild bat builds debug build

this package provides the aix event infrastructure that is detected by autoconf ibm documentation describes the package in more detail aix support for filesystem events is not compiled when building
