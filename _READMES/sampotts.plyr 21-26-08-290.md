automatically for youtube the origin should be updated to reflect the domain youre hosting the embed on or you can opt to omit it youtube embed we recommend progressive enhancement with the embedded

javascript theres 2 versions one with and one without polyfills my recommendation would be to manage polyfills seperately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build html script src https cdn plyr io 3 3 21 plyr js script or html script src https cdn plyr io 3 3 21 plyr polyfilled js script css include the plyr css stylsheet into your head html link rel stylesheet href path to plyr css if you want to use our cdn provided by fastly for the default css you can use the following html link rel stylesheet href https cdn plyr io 3 3 21 plyr css svg sprite the svg sprite is loaded automatically from our cdn provided by fastly to change this see the options below for reference the cdn hosted svg sprite can be found at https cdn plyr io 3 3 21 plyr svg ads plyr has partnered up with vi ai to offer monetization options for your videos getting setup is easy sign up for a vi ai account grab your publisher id from the code snippet enable ads in the config options and enter your publisher id any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi ai and any issues with rendering raised through github issues advanced sass you can use bundle scss file included in src as part of your build and change variables to suit your design the sass require you to use the autoprefixer plugin you be should already as all declarations use the w3c definitions the html markup uses the bem methodology with plyr as the block e g plyr controls you can change the class hooks in the options to match any custom css you write check out the javascript source for more on this svg the icons used in the plyr controls are loaded in an svg sprite the sprite is automatically loaded from our cdn by default if you already have an icon build system in place you can include the source plyr icons see src sprite for source icons using the iconurl option you can however specify your own iconurl option and plyr will determine if the url is absolute and requires loading by ajax cors due to current browser limitations or if its a relative path just use the path directly if youre using the base tag on your site you may need to use something like this svgfixer js more info on svg sprites here http css tricks com svg sprites use better icon fonts and the ajax technique here http css tricks com ajaxing svg sprite cross origin cors youll notice the crossorigin attribute on the example video elements this is because the texttrack captions are loaded from another domain if your texttrack captions are also hosted on another domain you will need to add this attribute and make sure your host has the correct headers setup for more info on cors checkout the mdn docs https developer mozilla org en us docs web http access control cors captions webvtt captions are supported to add a caption track check the html example above and look for the track element be sure to validate your caption files javascript initialising you can specify a range of arguments for the constructor to use a css string selector thats compatible with queryselector a htmlelement a nodelist a jquery object note if a nodelist array or jquery object are passed the first element will be used for setup to setup multiple players see setting up multiple players below heres some examples passing a string selector javascript const player new plyr player passing a htmlelement javascript const player new plyr document getelementbyid player passing a nodelist see note below javascript const player new plyr document queryselectorall js player the nodelist htmlelement or string selector can be the target video audio or div wrapper for embeds setting up multiple players you have two choices here you can either use a simple array loop to map the constructor javascript const players array from document queryselectorall js player map p new plyr p or use a static method where you can pass a string selector a nodelist or an array of elements javascript const players plyr setup js player both options will also return an array of instances in the order of they were in the dom for the string selector or the source nodelist or array passing options the second argument for the constructor is the options object javascript const player new plyr player options in all cases the constructor will return a plyr object that can be used with the api methods see the api section for more info options options can be passed as an object to the constructor as above or as json in data plyr config attribute on each of your target elements html video src path to video mp4 id player controls data plyr config title this is an example video volume 1 debug true video note the single quotes encapsulating the json and double quotes on the object keys

access to the api can be obtained this way through the event detail plyr property heres an example javascript player on ready event const instance event detail plyr standard media events event type description progress sent periodically to inform interested parties of progress downloading the media information about the current amount of the media that has been downloaded is available in the media elements buffered attribute playing sent when the media begins to play either for the first time after having been paused or after ending and then restarting play sent when playback of the media starts after having been paused that is when playback is resumed after a prior pause event pause sent when playback is paused timeupdate the time indicated by the elements currenttime attribute has changed volumechange sent when the audio volume changes both when the volume is set and when the muted state is changed seeking sent when a seek operation begins seeked sent when a seek operation completes ratechange sent when the playback speed changes ended sent when playback completes note this does not fire if autoplay is true enterfullscreen sent when the player enters fullscreen mode either the proper fullscreen or full window fallback for older browsers exitfullscreen sent when the player exits fullscreen mode captionsenabled sent when captions are enabled captionsdisabled sent

medias metadata has finished loading all attributes now contain as much useful information as theyre going to canplay sent when enough data is available that the media can be played at least for a couple of frames this corresponds to the have enough data readystate canplaythrough sent when the ready state changes to can play through indicating that the entire media can be played without interruption assuming the download rate remains at least at the current level note manually setting the currenttime will eventually fire a canplaythrough event in firefox other browsers might not fire this event stalled sent when the user agent is trying to fetch media data but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming waiting sent when the requested operation such as playback is delayed pending the completion of another operation such as a seek emptied he media has become empty for example this event is sent if the media has already been loaded or partially loaded and the load method is called to reload it cuechange sent when a texttrack has changed the currently displaying cues error sent when an error occurs the elements error attribute contains more information youtube only event type

youtube docs for more information qualitychange the quality of playback has changed qualityrequested a change to playback quality has been requested note a change to quality can only be requested via the api there is no guarantee the quality will change to the level requested you should listen to the qualitychange event for true changes note these events also bubble up the dom the event target will be the container element some event details borrowed from mdn embeds youtube and vimeo are currently supported and function much like a html5 video similar events and api methods are available for all types however if you wish to access the apis directly you can do so via the embed property of your player object e g player embed you can then use the relevant methods from the third party apis more info on the respective apis here youtube iframe api reference vimeo player js reference note not all api methods may work 100 your mileage may vary its better to use the plyr api where possible shortcuts by default a player will bind the following keyboard shortcuts when it has focus if you have the global option to true and theres only one player in the document then the shortcuts will work when any element has focus apart from an element that requires input key action 0 to 9 seek from 0 to 90 respectively space toggle playback k toggle playback ← seek backward by the seektime option → seek forward by the seektime option ↑ increase volume ↓ decrease volume m toggle mute f toggle fullscreen c toggle captions l toggle loop fullscreen fullscreen in plyr is supported by all browsers that currently support it browser support plyr supports the last 2 versions of most modern browsers browser supported safari ✓ mobile safari ✓¹ firefox ✓ chrome ✓ opera ✓ edge ✓ ie11 ✓³ ie10 ✓²³ mobile safari on the iphone forces the native player for video unless the playsinline attribute is present volume controls are also disabled as they are handled device wide native player used no support for progress or input type range but the api is supported no native fullscreen support fallback can be used see options polyfills required see below polyfills plyr uses es6 which isnt supported in all browsers quite yet this means some features will need to be polyfilled to be available otherwise youll run into issues weve elected to not burden the 90 of users that do support these features with extra js and instead leave polyfilling to you to work out based on your needs the easiest method ive found is to use polyfill io which provides polyfills based on user agent this is the method the demo uses checking for support you can use the static method to check for support for example javascript const supported plyr supported video html5 true the arguments are media type audio or video provider html5 youtube or vimeo whether the player has the playsinline attribute only applicable to ios 10 disable support programatically the enabled option can be used to disable certain user agents for example if you dont want to use plyr for smartphones you could use javascript enabled android webos iphone ipad ipod blackberry i test navigator useragent if a user agent is disabled but supports video and audio natively it will use the native player rangetouch some touch browsers particularly mobile safari on ios seem to have issues with input type range elements whereby touching the track to set the value doesnt work and sliding the thumb can be tricky to combat this ive created rangetouch which id recommend including in your solution its a tiny script with a nice benefit for users on touch devices issues if you find anything weird with plyr please let us know using the github issues tracker author plyr is developed by sam potts sampotts me with help from the awesome
