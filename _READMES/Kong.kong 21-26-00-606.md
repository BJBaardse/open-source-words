kong is a cloud native fast scalable and distributed microservice abstraction layer also known as an api gateway api middleware or in some cases service mesh made available as an open source project in 2015 its core values are high performance and extensibility actively maintained kong is widely used in production at companies ranging from startups to global 5000 as well as government organizations installation documentation forum blog irc freenode kong summary why kong features distributions development enterprise support demo license why kong if you are building for web mobile or iot internet of things you will likely end up needing common functionality to run your actual software kong can help by acting as a gateway or a sidecar for microservices requests while providing load balancing logging authentication rate limiting transformations and more through plugins features cloud native platform agnostic kong can run from bare metal to kubernetes dynamic load balancing load balance traffic across multiple upstream services hash based load balancing load balance with consistent hashing sticky sessions circuit breaker intelligent tracking of unhealthy upstream services health checks active and passive monitoring of your upstream services service discovery resolve srv records in third party dns resolvers like consul serverless invoke and secure aws lambda or openwhisk functions directly from kong websockets communicate to your upstream services via websockets oauth2 0 easily add oauth2 0 authentication to your apis logging log requests and responses to your system over http tcp udp or to disk security acl bot detection whitelist blacklist ips etc syslog logging to system log ssl setup a specific ssl certificate for an underlying service or api monitoring live monitoring provides key load and performance server metrics forward proxy make kong connect to intermediary transparent http proxies authentications hmac jwt basic and more rate limiting block and throttle requests based on many variables transformations add remove or manipulate http requests and responses caching cache and serve responses at the proxy layer cli control your kong cluster from the command line rest api kong can be operated with its restful api for maximum flexibility geo replicated configs are always up to date across different regions failure detection recovery kong is unaffected if one of your cassandra nodes goes down clustering all kong nodes auto join the cluster keeping their config updated across nodes scalability distributed by nature kong scales horizontally by simply adding nodes performance kong handles load with ease by scaling and using nginx at the core plugins extendable architecture for adding functionality to kong and apis for more info about plugins you can check out the plugins hub distributions kong comes in many shapes while this repository contains its cores source code other repos are also under active development kong docker a dockerfile for running kong in docker kong packages pre built packages for debian red hat and os x distributions shipped with each release kong vagrant a vagrantfile for provisioning a development ready environment for kong kong homebrew homebrew formula for kong kong cloudformation kong in a 1 click deployment for aws ec2 kong aws ami kong ami on the aws marketplace kong on microsoft azure run kong using azure resource manager kong on heroku deploy kong on heroku in one click kong and instaclustr let instaclustr manage your cassandra cluster development if you are planning on developing on kong youll need a development installation the next branch holds the latest unreleased source code you can read more about writing your own plugins in the plugin development guide or browse an online version of kongs source code documentation in the public lua api reference vagrant you can use a vagrant box running kong and postgres that you can find at kong kong vagrant source install kong mostly is an openresty application made of lua source files but also requires some additional third party dependencies we recommend installing those by following the source install instructions at https getkong org install source instead of following the second step install kong clone this repository and install the latest lua sources instead of the currently released ones shell git clone https github com kong kong cd kong you might want to switch to the development branch see contributing md git checkout next install the lua sources luarocks make running for development check out the development section of the default configuration file for properties to tweak in order to ease the development process for kong modifying the lua package path and lua package cpath directives will allow kong to find your custom plugins source code wherever it might be in your system tests install the development dependencies busted luacheck with shell make dev kong relies on three test suites using the busted testing library unit tests integration tests which require postgres and cassandra to be up and running plugins tests which require postgres to be running the first can simply be run after installing busted and running make test however the integration and plugins tests will spawn a kong instance and perform their tests against it as so consult edit the spec kong tests conf configuration file to make your test instance point to your postgres cassandra servers depending on your needs you can run the integration tests assuming both postgres and cassandra are running and configured according to spec kong tests conf with make test integration and the plugins tests with make test plugins finally all suites can be run at once by simply using make test all consult the run tests sh script for a more advanced example usage of the tests suites and the makefile finally a very useful tool in lua development as with many other dynamic languages is performing static linting of your code you can use luacheck installed with make dev for this make lint makefile when developing you can use the makefile for doing the following operations name description install install the kong luarock globally dev install development dependencies lint lint lua files in kong and spec test run the unit tests suite test integration run the integration tests suite test plugins run the plugins test suite test all run all unit integration plugins tests at once enterprise support demo if you are working in a large organization you should learn more about kong
