中文说明 a common architecture for android applications developing based on mvp integrates many open source projects like dagger2、rxjava、retrofit to make your developing quicker and easier architectural usage new project the following steps are too cumbersome now you can use the new feature generate an app module with one click in new projects to avoid the cumbersome configuration of the project to quickly open the world of mvparms if you are building a new project directly to the entire project clone or download as app as the main module it is recommended to remove the arms module and use gradle to depend on this framework remotely for easy updates then the package name into their own package name app module contains the package structure can be used directly a mainstream mvp dagger2 retrofit rxjava framework so easy to build successful and now you refer mvp package under the useractivity format use template to automatically generate mvp dagger2 related classes with access to wiki documents slowly grasp the framework to see more articles as soon as possible in the project to use it in practice learning is the fastest old project old projects would like to introduce this framework you can refer to the wiki documentation written in great detail wiki detailed usage reference wiki must see notice mvparms learning project collection box update log common issues the use of these technologies for the latter part of the project maintenance and iterative especially large projects is very helpful but is to develop a pre write a page to write a lot of mvp dagger2 class and interface which is indeed a headache for the development of pre now the framework has been able to template automatically generate some mvp dagger2 template code and now we can very easily use the framework use this frame comes with automatic adaptation function please refer to androidautolayout this framework does not provide any third party libraries associated with the ui except for the androidautolayout screen adaptation scheme functionality libraries mvp googles officialmvp architecture project which contains several different schema branches this is the dagger branch dagger2 rxjava rxandroid rxlifecycle rxcache rxpermissions rxerrohandler retrofit okhttp autolayout gson butterknife androideventbus timber glide leakcanary who is using mvparms 小顶家装 工长端 小顶家装 工人端 小顶家装 材料端 小顶网 智播 天天视频 天天直播 中斗通航 中斗祥云 麋鹿旅行 汇财富 觅窝 晒墨宝 in progress app your app update tuesday 26 september 2017 cache tuesday 12 september 2017 lifecycleable thursday 20 july 2017 retrofiturlmanager tuesday 13 june 2017 progressmanager wednesday 31 may 2017 template monday 24 april 2017 appdelegate thursday 13 april 2017 repositorymanager thursday 15 december 2016 appmanager sunday 25 december 2016 globeconfigmodule monday 26 december 2016 version update acknowledgements thanks to all the three libraries used in this framework author and all for the open sourece selfless contributions developer and organizations so that we can better work and study i will also spare time return to the open source community donate about me email jess yan effort gmail com home http jessyan me 掘金 https gold xitu io user 57a9dbd9165abd0061714613 简书 http www jianshu com u 1d0c0bc634db license copyright 2016 jessyan licensed under the apache license version 2 0 the license you may not use this file except in compliance with the license you may obtain a copy of the license at http www apache org licenses license 2 0 unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software distributed under the license is distributed on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied see the license for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the license
