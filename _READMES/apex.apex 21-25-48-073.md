apex lets you build deploy and manage aws lambda functions with ease with apex you can use languages that are not natively supported by aws lambda through the use of a node js shim injected into the build a variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions rolling back deploys viewing metrics tailing logs hooking into the build system and more this project is designed for event driven pipelines as it does not abstract away faas functions as a service if you are building web applications apis or sites consider using apex up which provides a more out of the box experience for these use cases installation on macos linux or openbsd run the following curl https raw githubusercontent com apex apex master install sh sh note that you may need to run the sudo version below or alternatively chown usr local curl https raw githubusercontent com apex apex master install sh sudo sh on windows download binary after downloading rename binary file apex exe then add to path if already installed upgrade with apex upgrade runtimes currently supports node js golang python java rust clojure example projects for all supported runtimes can be found in examples directory features supports languages lambda does not natively support via shim binary install install apex quickly for continuous deployment in ci etc hook support for running commands transpile code lint dependency management etc batteries included but optional opt in to higher level abstractions environment variable population via command line file or inline config idempotent deployments checksums skip already deployed code multiple environments via project env json and function env json files configuration inheritance and overrides command line function invocation with json streams command function name autocompletion function name globbing ex apex deploy api transparently generates a zip for your deploy project bootstrapping with optional terraform support function metrics and cost analysis ignore deploying files with apexignore function rollback support tail function logs concurrency for quick deploys dry run to preview changes vpc support sponsors does your company use apex help keep the project bug free and feature rich by sponsoring the project backers love our work and community become a backer example apex projects are made up of a project json configuration file and zero or more lambda functions defined in the functions directory heres an example file structure project json functions ├── bar │ ├── function json │ └── index js └── foo ├── function json └── index js the project json file defines project level configuration that applies to all functions and defines dependencies for this simple example the following will do json name example description example project each function uses a function json configuration file to define function specific properties such as the runtime amount of memory allocated and timeout this file is completely optional as you can specify defaults in your project json file for example json name bar description node js example function runtime nodejs4 3 memory 128 timeout 5 role arn aws iam 293503197324 role lambda now the directory structure for your project would be project json functions ├── bar │ └── index js └── foo └── index js finally the source for the functions themselves look like this in node js js console log start bar exports handle function e ctx ctx succeed hello e name apex operates at the project level but many commands allow you to specify specific functions for example you may deploy the entire project with a single command apex deploy or whitelist functions to deploy apex deploy foo bar invoke it echo name tobi apex invoke bar hello tobi see the documentation for more information links website medium slack
